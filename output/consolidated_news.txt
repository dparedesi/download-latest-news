(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s co-chief for the Middle East and North Africa and one of its top asset-management executives is set to leave the bank. Fadi Abuali is departing the New York-based firm after almost 28 years with the company, according to an internal memo. A Goldman spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. Abuali was instrumental in expanding Goldman’s franchise in the Middle Eastern and North Africa since he was appointed co-CEO for the region alongside Zaid Khaldi almost five years ago. The bank opened an office in Abu Dhabi in 2023 and last year became the first Wall Street lender to secure a so-called regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund agreed to anchor Goldman’s new private-credit and public-equity strategies in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf. As part of the bank’s push into Middle Eastern private credit, it is relocating London-based executive Deb Dutt to the region, Abuali said in a recent interview. Goldman asset managers in the Middle East have been in high demand, with Khalid Albdah, head of Goldman in Saudi Arabia and co-head of the regional asset-management arm, leaving late last year for Neuberger Berman. Earlier in 2024, BlackRock Inc. tapped Mohammad Al Fahim, who oversaw Goldman’s Abu Dhabi branch, to head its operations in the United Arab Emirates. Aside from the Middle East and North Africa, Abuali also jointly ran Goldman Asset Management’s international arm, serving as a key lieutenant to Marc Nachmann, global head of the bank’s asset- and wealth-management business, and was global co-head of the asset-management institutional-client business.

Title: This Energy Company Just Scored A $53 Million Contract And The Stock Is On Fire

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Turbo Energy S.A. TURB stock skyrocketed Tuesday after the company announced it won a $53 million contract to deliver energy storage projects in Spain with a total capacity of 366 MWh over the next two years. The deal involves more than 10 sites operated by a major construction industry client. Turbo Energy will integrate its systems fully and use its AI-based management platform to help the facilities cut power costs, improve efficiency, and expand electrification. Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, said the agreement highlights confidence in the company's storage technology. "By entrusting us with the deployment of our C&I systems across multiple industrial facilities, this project is not only validating our competitively differentiated storage technology but also enabling substantial operational cost savings," he said. Also Read: Solidion Technology Stock Explodes After Clean Energy Breakthrough Recognition The initiative will use Turbo Energy's SUNBOX Industry system, launched in 2024. With a range from 30 kW to 2,000 kW and storage capacity of 30 kWh to 4,000 kWh, SUNBOX Industry offers flexibility for industrial users. Its brand-agnostic design allows it to work with legacy infrastructure, easing expansion for customers facing volatile energy markets. The project advances both customer sustainability goals and Europe's decarbonization push. Turbo Energy said the expansion strengthens its role in large-scale storage and its commitment to cost-efficient clean power. Turbo Energy also revealed last week that it signed a landmark deal with Uber Technologies UBER to power the company's EV fleet in Spain. The project uses its SUNBOX Industry system to overcome grid constraints by adding flexible storage capacity, creating a 1 MW / 2 MWh smart hub capable of charging more than 300 vehicles. CEO Mariano Soria said the initiative showcases a scalable model for fleet electrification, underscoring the role of advanced storage in Europe's transportation decarbonization. ETFs such as the Invesco Solar ETF TAN and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN also provide exposure to the renewable energy market. Price Action: TURB shares were trading higher by 535.19% to $17.15 at last check Tuesday.

US stock market experienced a modest pullback on Tuesday as investors balanced optimism from strong consumer spending against uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s much-anticipated policy meeting. Despite the slight declines in major indexes, economic data revealed robust retail sales in August, rising 0.6%, well above expectations. This indicates that American consumers remain resilient even as inflation persists and the labor market shows signs of softening.

Title: Charlie Kirk Predicted: “AI Will Take Your Jobs in the Next Five Years”

Time Published: 2025-09-16T15:25:56Z

By Byron King PostedSeptember 16, 2025 “This is my broad opinion on AI (artificial intelligence),” said the man speaking to a crowd of over 1,500 students at the University of Tennessee. “For about 95% of what all of you guys are studying, AI will take your jobs in the next five years.” This comment is from last March, by the late Charlie Kirk during a visit to U of T’s Knoxville campus. Kirk answered a student’s question about studying AI, considering Kirk’s well-known skepticism of the value of much of what passes for education in current American Academe. The late Charlie Kirk, speaking at University of Tennessee last March. Courtesy Knox News/News Sentinel. Kirk was a humble person, and certainly never presented himself as a scholar on the topic of AI. So, he may or may not have been correct about that 95% number, and/or what havoc AI will wreak on the job market over “the next five years.” On that point, we must live, learn, watch, wait and see. Perhaps AI will eliminate less than 95% of jobs, and perhaps the looming juggernaut might take longer than five years to put many people out of work. But one way or another, Kirk nailed the point that a highly disruptive AI trend is taking shape. More on that in just a moment… Meanwhile, the AI investment boom has already delivered huge gains to investors who bought early, and even to investors who jumped aboard the proverbial moving train a bit late, as it left the station. For example, and to highlight just a few names among many, we’ve seen huge moves in share price for companies that make advanced computer chips (NVDIA Corp.; NVDA), and the machinery that makes chips (ASML Holdings; ASML); software plays and system integrators (Oracle Corp; ORCL); and certainly, with the energy angle that powers AI and ranges from electric utilities (Constellation Energy; CEG) to equipment makers (GE Vernova; GEV). Again, more on this this last angle in a moment as well… But first, no doubt you know that Charlie Kirk was gunned down last week while hosting one of his trademark debate events (“Prove Me Wrong!”), this time at Utah Valley University, outside of Salt Lake City. He was assassinated by a sniper who fired a single shot. And the shooter – the “alleged shooter” as we’re supposed to say – is in custody. The suspect is 22 years old and wasn’t associated with the university. Indeed, news accounts state that a couple of years ago, this guy dropped out of an entirely different college and enrolled in a trade school. He walked onto the Utah Valley campus last week for one reason only… As is almost always the case, right now there’s much we don’t know. The state and federal investigation is ongoing, although it’s not out of bounds to say that, based on recovered communications, perhaps the perp had associates. And perhaps he’s not just another “disturbed lone gunman” of popular myth when important people get shot. We’ll see. Plus, in this same context we have a developing, fast-growing narrative about how certain kinds of people become criminally radicalized by what they see and follow on the internet and social media (more accurately, “anti-social media”). Birds of a feather, so to speak. In fact, the man in custody appears to be a subset of disgruntled humanity that intelligence services refer to as “nihilist extremists.” As derived from the Latin word nihil, which means “nothing,” and the belief in a sense of nothingness. But in the case of certain individuals, they take their nothingness to the far edges of misconduct. In this particular case it was the cold-blooded public execution of a private citizen who also happened to be a nationally recognized public and politically influential figure. To me at least, the murder of Charlie Kirk is arguably the highest profile political assassination in America since the 1960s; since the days of Robert Kennedy, Sr. and Martin Luther King. (Note: President Reagan survived his 1981 encounter, just barely.) And this leads to a couple of points. Definitely (as in… obviously), many American colleges and universities lean politically left. Just visit a few campuses and walk around. And it’s not out of bounds – not for me, anyhow – to opine that a distressingly large number of impressionable young minds have been ruined by exposure to the Marxian milieus that dominate many humanities and social science departments within so-called “higher” education. Cartoon that speaks for itself. Courtesy Zero Hedge. Meanwhile, saving or salvaging young people from a lifetime intellectual handicap of early-onset, left-wing indoctrination was among Charlie Kirk’s missions in life, and brought him to his fateful, fatal visit to Utah last week. He was good at his job, so yeah, somebody shot him. At the same time, in this instance it’s evident that Kirk’s shooter was not radicalized in college; as noted above, the guy dropped out of a completely different school and there was no first-hand college knowledge inside this fellow’s head. In other words, with whatever degree of radicalism we have with Kirk’s assassin, he apparently picked it up on his own, inside the echo chambers of online content that he followed. Looking ahead, it’s likely that forensic investigators will scrub his internet history for everything they can find; maybe we’ll learn a few things. And this brings up something that I’ve heard from more than a few college and university faculty members. Namely, that many incoming students show up at the front gates already radicalized by their high school experiences at both public and private/independent secondary schools. So, the left-oriented indoctrination machine is not entirely a collegiate phenomenon because more than a few secondary schools have also been overrun and captured as well. Plus, an even broader issue is at work here. It’s that anymore, young people everywhere have grown up in an unfiltered world of smart phones and global-scale internet access to anything and everything that can flow through the fibers and Wi-Fi channels. The good, the bad, and the ugly. The takeaway is that we’re now reaping the harvest of about a (so-far) 20-year, uncontrolled, mass-psychological experiment. In essence, American society, and the nation’s overall economic system, allowed everyone – certainly children and young adults – to have constant, instant access to everything that’s out there in the ether. Which prompts one to ask, “Was this ever a good idea?” Sure, some kids have benefitted greatly from their lifetime of online access. Perhaps they became much smarter, much faster, at a much earlier age than otherwise might have been the case. Hey, maybe some of them now work for SpaceX, building better rocket engines. Or they’re changing the world for the better in other ways. But other people – obviously, look at the recent Kirk shooter – hung out online, fried their brain with antisocial content, and became dangerously radicalized. In short, they developed a deeply flawed moral compass and bizarre worldviews. Meanwhile, it’s not as if Kirk’s shooter is some sort of impressionable dummy. From news accounts the perp is supposedly an intelligent person. One report stated that he scored an impressive 34 out of 36 on the ACT, a high school standardized exam that’s widely used to rank applicants by college admission committees. And in this regard, Kirk’s shooter joins quite a rogues’ gallery of otherwise-intelligent people who traveled down a dark road. For example, Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old who shot President Trump last year in Butler, Pennsylvania reputedly scored over 1500 on his SAT exams, a result good enough to be considered as an entrant for even the most competitive of colleges. Or think back to other eras and instances when smart people went bad. For example, in the 1960s a young Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) earned a degree in mathematics from Harvard and then an MS and PhD in math from the University of Michigan. And going further back in history to 1865, a then-26-year-old John Wilkes Booth – among the greatest and fastest-rising Shakespearean actors of his era – assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. In this regard, it’s not as if political radicalization is a modern phenomenon. Nor even nihilism and extremism, because the archives of time reveal many young guys who crossed the lines and did terrible things. But anymore, it also appears that our internet age is capable of creating and spreading dysfunction and radicalization at wide, even industrial scale and affecting growing numbers of people. Here’s the quandary: we have an open system that leads more and more people to go nihilist, and then down extreme pathways. Which brings us back to Charlie Kirk’s comment about AI taking away jobs… “I love that,” said Kirk to his questioner. “I love the AI discussion because it’s going to flush out ethical arguments immediately. … It is going to force the greatest question of what is a human being? What is right? What is wrong? So I’m curious, at the University of Tennessee, what do they consider to be ethical?” Well, here we have some unusual questions! And from Charlie Kirk, who was upfront about the fact that he never attended college or university. He turned 18 and went into business with his Turning Point organization. Usually, public discussion of AI is about how great and wonderful it is. And about all the companies whose shares are soaring in the stock market. Or the hundreds of billions of dollars of capital investment going into hardware, software, data centers, electric power and more. Or the hype about what AI is already doing, and how it will eventually do even more and better in the future. That, and if “we” don’t somehow win the ongoing global AI arms race, China will win it and dominate the world. And there was Charlie Kirk in Knoxville, pondering the ethics of AI. Right away, one gets the sense that he foreshadowed his own eventual, tragic fate at the hands of a guy (or maybe a cabal of guys) who used existing online content to override any sense of classical ethics, and to spool himself/themselves to the point of targeted assassination. Another way to frame the issue is that the past 20-plus years of unfettered growth of the internet, and online access to anything/everything, has led to a national-scale level of political polarization that we see now (and certainly, with the above-noted nihilist extremist crowd). So, looking ahead, what might we expect from the next 20-plus years of AI? Well first, nobody knows, although this last question is absolutely worth pondering because AI is already many steps above the mere, day-to-day, old-fashioned internet thingy. Indeed, AI is a process that scrapes entire libraries of data from the online archives, and reshapes it and reforms it into… well, into what? Okay sure, it’s one thing for a high school or college kid to use AI to “help” write a term paper; and yes, I’m being charitable here. It’s quite another when AI takes over key elements of how we run society. Think in terms of AI-generated news, government policy stances, economic and even military decisions. (Whoops, too late; many military decisions are already AI-driven, up to and including when to fire weapons and at what targets.) Meanwhile, let’s return to Kirk’s comment that I used at the beginning of this note, about how “AI will take your jobs in the next five years.” Umm, yes… That’s already happening. Consider the news accounts of companies across the spectrum that are replacing people with AI, from banks and real estate to medicine and factory production. Just scan a few headlines about how difficult it is for young college grads to find jobs anymore, and how many young people are taking whatever work they can land, just to have a paycheck, versus finding a job in what they studied in school. So, per Charlie Kirk, AI will take away the jobs that college kids hope to have. And there, he has bracketed one key the point. What does the AI future hold? Well, the irony is that even big-name AI plays (the usual suspects) offer diminishing hope ever to justify their currently lofty share prices. That is, much of the AI race involves spending massive capex up front on equipment, buildouts, software and some sort of whiz-bang product to offer for sale. But the AI sales numbers – revenues that ring the cash register – are generally awful. And the dark implication is that all this up-front outlay is driving the broad sector towards commodity-level pricing, which means that few players will ever make any serious money. There’s an argument to be made that AI – well, AI as currently practiced – is a massive misallocation of resources, with next to no real forecast about what it will do to large and growing segments of the populace. Radicalization, anyone? Nihilism? Extremism? Hey, give it time. Sadly and tragically, we won’t have Charlie Kirk anymore, out there asking simple but insightful questions and debating the replies. In this regard, it falls to others to confront the orthodoxy of big money flowing willy-nilly into untested ideas and undiscovered lands. Oh, and if you have made some good money in AI, be sure to take a whack off the table and find another home for it when things begin to crater. Buy gold, for example. That’s all for now.

Microsoft Corporation MSFT said on Monday that its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, representing an increase of 8 cents, or 10%, from the prior payout. The dividend will be distributed on December 11, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 20, 2025, which is also the ex-dividend date. The company also set December 5, 2025, as the date for its annual shareholders meeting. Investors of record at the close of business on September 30, 2025, will be eligible to vote. Also Read: How To Earn $500 A Month From Microsoft Stock The dividend boost comes on the heels of strong quarterly results. In July, Microsoft reported fourth-quarter revenue of $76.44 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The revenue total beat a Street consensus estimate of $73.80. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.65, beating a Street consensus estimate of $3.37. For the first quarter, Microsoft expects sales in a range of $74.70 billion to $75.80 billion versus $74.07 billion analyst estimate. Analysts have highlighted Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence momentum as key growth drivers. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives described the company’s fourth-quarter results as “eye-popping,” citing strong demand for cloud services and AI products. “Microsoft delivered strong fourth quarter results with strong guidance to start the year as the company’s ‘shining moment’ is now underway with AI already changing the growth trajectory of MSFT’s cloud growth story,” Ives said. He pointed to the launch of Azure AI Foundry as particularly important for enterprise adoption, adding that fiscal 2026 could be the company’s “true inflection year” for AI-driven growth. “We believe Microsoft is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front,” he said. Other analysts have echoed that optimism. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey maintained an Overweight rating and raised his price forecast from $581 to $639. Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated an Outperform rating and lifted his forecast from $600 to $630. KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader upgraded the stock to Overweight with a $630 forecast. Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin also reaffirmed an Overweight rating, raising his forecast from $600 to $650.

Δ The new financing, announced Tuesday (Sept. 16), brings the company’s total funding to $144 million and will be used to invest in Invisible’s core AI software platform. A report by Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar with the matter, says the new funding values Invisible at $2 billion. “I have spent the last decade experiencing both the promises and limitations of enterprise AI, driven by the fact that 70% of the software in the world is over 20 years old,” CEO Matthew Fitzpatrick said in a news release. “Despite the recent excitement, most enterprises are still struggling to get AI models into production and to quantify ROI. Invisible changes that. Our software platform, combined with our expert marketplace, enables companies to organize, clean, label, and map their data. This foundation enables them to build agentic workflows that drive real impact.” The release notes that Invisible was named the number two fastest growing AI companies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 List. The firm’s revenue more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, reaching $134 million, following a 24-fold increase between 2020 and 2023.

All of which reinforce the momentum behind agentic AI,” the report added. Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research finds that despite all the attention centered on Gen Z’s comfort with AI, it’s millennials who are using the technology at work. This embrace, PYMNTS wrote last week, shows how AI is moving from novelty to utility. The research shows that 52% of millennials use gen AI for work, the highest of any generation, while 61% report that gen AI helps them accomplish more, faster. “More than 70% of millennial users are highly satisfied with gen AI tools — more than any other generation,” PYMNTS added. “Only 6.5% report low satisfaction, suggesting that their adoption is not just frequent, but confident.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: Mitsotakis: Reliable and costed fiscal policy is a fundamental principle

The impressive growth dynamics of the Greek economy were mentioned, among others, by the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who participated today in a discussion with BlackRock Vice President Philip Hildebrand and Adebayo Ogunlezi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, at the Athens International Investors Summit investment conference, organised by Yperat Fund and BlackRock. He stressed that the fundamental principle is a reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy so that fiscal and macroeconomic stability is not questioned, that the benefits from the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens, while he also highlighted the importance of defense, which he called the supreme European public good. The Prime Minister also had the opportunity to address, before powerful investment players with broad portfolios, the country’s prospects, investment opportunities, and challenges in several sectors, and the issues of green transition and energy. During the forum, the establishment of the Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund, which is the investment arm of the Super Fund, was announced. “We are growing at a much higher rate than the eurozone average, while at the same time reducing taxes, focusing on private investment, promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment,” the prime minister said during his remarks. “We have achieved all this in an environment of political stability. We have a government with an absolute majority. In 2023, the citizens rewarded us by giving us a new mandate. I think this sets us apart from many other European countries, because coalition politics can be very complicated,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis continued. “I think the big challenge, from a political point of view, is to link the macroeconomic situation to everyday life and work, in an environment where the cost of living has become a big problem,” the prime minister stressed. “I think there is a general understanding that this page turn is here to stay. My job is to ensure that the changes we have implemented are irreversible. That’s my commitment to the investment community and, frankly, the main reason why I want to seek a third term. To ensure that what we have achieved continues and that the wealth we are creating for the country is maintained. My first commitment in 2023 was to raise wages. When I see unemployment falling from 18% to 8%, that means that real wages are rising, Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted. “This is the only way to truly distribute wealth,” he added. Referring to the importance of reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy, the prime minister noted: “The fundamental principle of our approach has always been not to question the pursuit of fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The 2009-2010 crisis was a consequence of the spending derailment and our failure to focus on fundamentally restructuring our economy. We will not repeat the same mistake, ever. That is why our commitment to generate primary surpluses and, whenever possible, fiscal surpluses, will not be challenged.” The Prime Minister also stressed that the benefits of the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens through systematic tax cuts, with an emphasis on middle incomes, young people and families with children. “The biggest reform that has contributed to the state budget has been our ability to address the problem of tax evasion. This brought a lot of money into the public coffers, which we now have to return to the citizens. So we reduced taxes for the middle class. We have reduced taxes for families with children. We have reduced income tax to zero for those under 25 years of age. I want to encourage young people to join the workforce; I don’t want them to wait years. I respect young kids who go to technical school and enter the workforce at age 20. I want them to know that we are thinking about them,” he said. During the debate on the future of European defence, given the current geopolitical landscape, the prime minister said: “We will need to mobilise not only private but also public funds. We will need to mobilise European public resources for defence. I have been clear on this issue; I have spoken about it on many occasions. The recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace has brought to the fore something that we already know is a major problem, and that concerns missile defence and air defence systems in Europe. Therefore, my proposal is very clear: a pan-European tool for what I consider to be a pan-European good. And defence is the ultimate European public good. We cannot allow our national priorities to become an obstacle to tackling what is essentially an existential threat to Europe. Can this happen? The answer is that I see much greater potential. Some of the traditionally ‘frugal’ countries, such as Denmark and Finland, are much more open to the idea of joint European defence borrowing.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis also addressed, among other things, the issue of green transition and energy. “Greece has been extremely successful in adding renewable energy sources, both solar and wind, to our energy mix. We produce more than 50% of our electricity from renewable sources. Especially in spring or autumn, we have the possibility of having all our electricity generated for hours from renewable sources. For the first time this summer, we have also seen greater price convergence between Western, Central, and South-Eastern Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “We need more interconnections. We have become net exporters of electricity. This has never happened before. But, of course, we will need additional investments in baseload – in the case of Greece, we are talking about natural gas – and of course, investments in storage. This is the plan as to how we intend to proceed with the green transition in a realistic way, but also taking into account that for us, renewable energy sources constitute an important comparative advantage,” he added.

Title: 3 High Yield Dividends To Buy As Stocks Hit All-Time Highs

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We’ve got a frankly, bizarre dynamic setting up in stocks right now. Global stocks are clobbering their American cousins this year. But here’s the disconnect: This is happening even though US stocks are hitting all-time highs seemingly every day. On the surface, it sounds like both of these can’t be true. But as we’ll see below, this setup makes total sense. We’ll also look at how we can play it for both offense—price upside, in other words—and defense (in the form of 8%+ dividends), too. Here we’re looking at the S&P 500, as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), in purple, compared to the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Index Fund (VEU), a good benchmark for global stocks (minus the US, as the name says), in orange. So what’s going on here? It’s only when we zoom out that things clear up: Over the long run, America’s lead is unquestionable—and it puts this year’s “blip” in much better context. This is why, if you subscribe to my CEF Insider service, you know I remain bullish on US stocks, particularly the high-yield closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold them. That’s because at CEF Insider we focus on dividends (often in the 8%+ range) and we think long-term. And while US stocks might trail for short periods, betting against America over the long term is always a mistake. But I do understand that more Americans are interested in buying international stocks. We can see that in the run they’ve put on this year: It quite simply wouldn’t have happened without Americans climbing aboard the global bandwagon. (America does, after all, have the highest percentage of stock investors in the world, at 55% of the population, going by the latest numbers from Visual Capitalist.) And holding at least some international stocks is just plain smart, especially if we see another April-style pullback in US markets. Beyond that, many international stocks pay higher dividends than US firms. Even looking across the northern border nets a considerably higher dividend yield, with index funds tracking major Canadian stocks yielding 2.6%, more than double the S&P 500’s 1.2%. But that’s still just 2.6%! Not nearly enough to fund a retirement on. VEU pays roughly the same. Then there’s VEU’s long-term underperformance, which I talked about a second ago. The main problem with VEU is that it’s simply too diversified. With its passive approach to owning just about everything abroad, it holds a lot of questionable companies in questionable countries. This is why actively managed funds (like the three 8%+ payers we’ll discuss below) have outperformed it in many cases. For instance, Tencent Holdings is one of VEU’s biggest positions, and the Chinese government has warned stock prices have gotten too high in the mainland as of late. That’s raised the possibility of new rules to limit stock speculation, which would hurt large stocks like Tencent. That’s why we want active management—especially in international stocks. That way we ensure we’re avoiding not just poor-quality companies but also those that operate in less-stable nations, where the rule of law may not be as strong as it is in places like North America and Europe. The three CEFs we’re going to discuss next give us that. Plus they’ve all beaten VEU (in green in the chart below) over the long term. And they’ve done so during a time when foreign assets were less popular among US investors. That sets them up for stronger gains now that more Americans are thinking globally. Let’s dive into them. The Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) gives us stock-like upside with convertible bonds acting as “ballast.” I say that because convertibles provide high, steady income, even in volatile markets. The result is a dividend that shows up every month and yields 8.1% on an annualized basis. With CHW, we’re effectively buying cash flow and the option to pivot between income-producing bonds and stocks, with both on sale; its largest positions—Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and a Boeing (BA) 6% convertible preferred bond—let us tap surging AI growth, while the convertible bond dampens pullbacks with its steadier price and payouts. And because the fund’s mandate spans the world, management can shift with volatility. This flexibility has also helped keep the fund’s dividend steady over the last three years. Next up is the LMP Capital & Income Fund (SCD), with its combination of income-producing assets and capital-gains-producing stocks. The fund pays monthly, at a 9.3% annualized rate. And it’s cheap, too, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). SCD’s biggest positions consist of both tech darlings and utilities, with names like Marvell Technology (MRVL), Oracle (ORCL) and PPL Corp. (PPL) pairing growth and reliability. The result is a steady, diversified cash machine that can lean toward offense or defense without putting the dividend at risk. Finally, let’s talk about a less-obvious investment I like because it combines American blue chips and top foreign firms. The Virtus NFJ Dividend Value Fund (NFJ) captures income from foreign demand while blending in US firms, with their reliable regulations. It also generates extra income using a covered-call strategy that generates more income when global tensions rise. NFJ owns dividend payers and convertibles, sells call options and hands us a 9.3% dividend while trading at a steep 9.5% discount. The fund also uses zero leverage—a nice extra margin of safety should interest rates unexpectedly rise. With a portfolio dominated by Alphabet (GOOGL), AMD (AMD) and Prologis (PLD), this fund combines American giants with large margins and reliable cash flows with exposure to foreign demand (about half of Alphabet’s revenue comes from abroad, and about a quarter for AMD). Now, I’ve been saving the best part, and it’s this chart. SCD’s discount (in orange above) recently exploded to a premium before fading to its 6.7% discount. CHW’s 10.8% discount (in purple) has broken through the 10% mark a few times lately, and NFJ’s 9.3% discount (in blue) has narrowed quite a bit. On the whole, this tells us that more investors are noticing these funds, setting up their discounts to shrink further, putting a lift under their share prices as they do.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably beating its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is less volatile, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Bengaluru: Snapdeal, run by AceVector, is relying on strong growth in fashion and apparel to strengthen its position in the competitive e-commerce space, especially during the high-stakes festive season when customer loyalty is low. According to CEO Achint Setia, the company has seen its fashion and lifestyle categories triple in growth this year, though exact figures remain undisclosed. Bengaluru: Snapdeal, run by AceVector, is relying on strong growth in fashion and apparel to strengthen its position in the competitive e-commerce space, especially during the high-stakes festive season when customer loyalty is low. According to CEO Achint Setia, the company has seen its fashion and lifestyle categories triple in growth this year, though exact figures remain undisclosed. “Fashion has been a standout category this year and, in fact, has been possibly the fastest-growing one so far. Overall, lifestyle [including fashion, home decor, and kitchen] already accounts for 90% of our business today, and fashion is a major driving force," Setia told Mint in an interview. Setia was appointed to the role in January, replacing Himanshu Chakrawarti, who led Snapdeal and its subsidiary Stellaro Brands for three years. Setia has over two decades of experience across marketing and strategy roles in firms like Myntra, Viacom18 Media, and Zalora Group. Also Read | Snapdeal is at the threshold of an IPO While the festival season is a key period for all consumer-facing brands and platforms, this year is particularly crucial for Snapdeal parent AceVector as it is currently waiting for the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) clearance to list in the public markets. “Approval from Sebi before the end of the financial year is crucial for Snapdeal parent AceVector. If they don't get it, or if they have to refile, they'll need to update their IPO documents with a full year of financial data. This means the festive season performance will be key in shaping investor sentiment, especially in a volatile market," said a senior e-commerce executive, asking not to be named. Key Takeaways Snapdeal parent AceVector's IPO hinges on festival season performance and small-town fashion demand. Fashion and lifestyle now account for 90% of Snapdeal’s business, with value pricing as a core strategy. Meesho, Flipkart, and Amazon dominate the same geographies Snapdeal targets. Snapdeal is avoiding quick commerce, focusing instead on improving delivery speed within its current model. Experts remain unconvinced of Snapdeal’s differentiation or growth potential in a crowded market. AceVector filed its draft papers for an IPO reportedly to raise ₹500 crore through the confidential route in July, which allows it to withhold public disclosure of IPO details until later stages. Setia declined to comment on the progress of the filing. Despite its early entry, Snapdeal is yet to make a mark among the top e-commerce players in the country by both market share and volume of transactions. For context, industry estimates show Flipkart as the market leader with 48% share, followed by Meesho and Amazon. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per an October 2024 report by Deloitte. Long way to goFounded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal was initially launched as a daily deals platform and later pivoted to a full-fledged marketplace in 2011. Over the years, it raised more than $1.8 billion in funding from SoftBank, Alibaba Group, Foxconn and BlackRock, among others. However, intense competition and the absence of a distinct growth strategy have gradually eroded Snapdeal’s momentum in the e-commerce space. Snapdeal largely caters to cities outside metropolitan areas where value retail has picked up in recent years. Within this, fashion remains the top growth driver—with more than 80% of orders placed priced below ₹599 and 80% of them coming from small town India, according to CEO Setia. “For us, it’s about the value-conscious mindset that could be sitting out of anywhere," he noted. Over the last few months, Snapdeal has invested substantially in in-house festive campaigns, as well as technology and tools for returns forecasting and logistics. According to Setia, it has also expanded its seller portfolio, adding more from key clusters like Tirupur, Surat, Ludhiana, and Agra. According to a September 2024 report by market research firm Centrum, the mass-market fashion segment accounts for 56% of India’s total apparel market. However, offline continues to account for more than half the sales, with Tata’s Trent, D-Mart, and Vishal Mega Mart offering a sufficient selection of price-conscious consumers in smaller towns. While small-town India offers a wide online shopping-savvy market waiting to be captured, Meesho has raced past Snapdeal in those geographies, especially in value commerce. “For a very long time, Snapdeal has been positioned as an e-commerce platform for Bharat, but it doesn’t necessarily hold a strong position. Meesho, Flipkart and Amazon have expanded their presence in these markets over the years, which means competition is so much more now," said Devangshu Dutta, founder and chief executive officer at consulting firm Third Eyesight. Also Read | Meesho posts maiden profit in July, weighs IPO in 12-18 months Moreover, the lack of loyalty in the value retail segment makes customer acquisition and retention costlier as ticket sizes are small and supply is crowded and fragmented, according to Ashutosh Sharma, vice president and research director at Forrester. “Snapdeal is trying hard to revive its brand. We don’t see it having a lot of market share or path to rapid growth in a crowded market unless they somehow differentiate or pivot to some other innovative approach, in a highly value-conscious market," Sharma added. Under stress, Snapdeal has made several attempts to revive its position. In 2016, it spent as much as ₹200 crore to rebrand and create a new brand identity, but very little changed. In FY24, Snapdeal’s revenue was flat at ₹379.6 crore, while losses narrowed nearly 43% to ₹160 crore, aided by lower expenses. Quick commerceWhile the e-commerce market gradually shifts to faster deliveries, Snapdeal remains unfazed. The firm will not look to enter the quick commerce race, stating that a market for all kinds of online commerce exists. “We are continuously exploring what our customers want. But at this point, we are focused on our current model while trying to improve delivery speed and experience. A lot of our orders are already delivered the next day. Having said that, quick commerce isn’t a priority because the inventory stock model is a different ballgame," said Snapdeal’s Setia. Also Read | Quick commerce fuels one-third of India’s ₹9,800 crore online FMCG sales “I believe there’s space for all kinds of online commerce to co-exist—traditional e-commerce, value commerce, and quick commerce," Setia noted. Third Eyesight’s Dutta believes this is a fair call. “I don’t think everybody wants everything within minutes, especially not lifestyle categories that Snapdeal is big on. Quick commerce also has very different infrastructure and capability demands." “Fashion has been a standout category this year and, in fact, has been possibly the fastest-growing one so far.

AceVector filed its draft papers for an IPO reportedly to raise ₹500 crore through the confidential route in July, which allows it to withhold public disclosure of IPO details until later stages. Setia declined to comment on the progress of the filing. Despite its early entry, Snapdeal is yet to make a mark among the top e-commerce players in the country by both market share and volume of transactions. For context, industry estimates show Flipkart as the market leader with 48% share, followed by Meesho and Amazon. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per an October 2024 report by Deloitte. Long way to goFounded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal was initially launched as a daily deals platform and later pivoted to a full-fledged marketplace in 2011. Over the years, it raised more than $1.8 billion in funding from SoftBank, Alibaba Group, Foxconn and BlackRock, among others. However, intense competition and the absence of a distinct growth strategy have gradually eroded Snapdeal’s momentum in the e-commerce space. Snapdeal largely caters to cities outside metropolitan areas where value retail has picked up in recent years. Within this, fashion remains the top growth driver—with more than 80% of orders placed priced below ₹599 and 80% of them coming from small town India, according to CEO Setia. “For us, it’s about the value-conscious mindset that could be sitting out of anywhere," he noted. Over the last few months, Snapdeal has invested substantially in in-house festive campaigns, as well as technology and tools for returns forecasting and logistics. According to Setia, it has also expanded its seller portfolio, adding more from key clusters like Tirupur, Surat, Ludhiana, and Agra. According to a September 2024 report by market research firm Centrum, the mass-market fashion segment accounts for 56% of India’s total apparel market. However, offline continues to account for more than half the sales, with Tata’s Trent, D-Mart, and Vishal Mega Mart offering a sufficient selection of price-conscious consumers in smaller towns. While small-town India offers a wide online shopping-savvy market waiting to be captured, Meesho has raced past Snapdeal in those geographies, especially in value commerce. “For a very long time, Snapdeal has been positioned as an e-commerce platform for Bharat, but it doesn’t necessarily hold a strong position. Meesho, Flipkart and Amazon have expanded their presence in these markets over the years, which means competition is so much more now," said Devangshu Dutta, founder and chief executive officer at consulting firm Third Eyesight.

We don’t see it having a lot of market share or path to rapid growth in a crowded market unless they somehow differentiate or pivot to some other innovative approach, in a highly value-conscious market," Sharma added. Under stress, Snapdeal has made several attempts to revive its position. In 2016, it spent as much as ₹200 crore to rebrand and create a new brand identity, but very little changed.

Title: How Lyft’s CEO Got the Company Moving Again

Full Content:
What it takes to rebuild confidence, culture, and competitive edge. In the winter of 2023, Lyft was facing declining market share and financial pressures. Enter new CEO David Risher, who took the helm amid low morale and limited resources. His challenge: reignite innovation, refocus the culture, and find new ways to stand out in an industry dominated by Uber. Harvard Business School professor Ranjay Gulati joins host Brian Kenny to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” They explore how Risher led during a strategic crossroads, making bold decisions, putting the customer front and center, and shaking loose old habits. Gulati also shares insights from his new book, How to Be Bold, illustrating how courage becomes a competitive advantage in times of uncertainty. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we delve deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s pretty rare for an industry to go from zero to Mach speed in just a few years, but that’s exactly how it’s gone for rideshare services. Since the first peer-to-peer rideshare service launched in 2012, well over a billion people have climbed aboard. Today we’ll dive deep into this phenomenon with a case about Lyft, long the challenger in the ridesharing industry. They faced a choice: double down on product innovation, reinvest in a neglected brand, or simply shore up operations after years of crisis. With a new leader at the wheel, the firm was at a crossroad that called for bold, decisive leadership. Today we’ll unpack the case, discuss how boldness shapes corporate strategy and leadership, and explore what it takes to turn courage into a competitive advantage. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Ranjay Gulati to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. Ranjay Gulati’s work explores leadership and strategic challenges for building high-growth organizations in turbulent markets. His new book, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage explores how individuals and organizations can cultivate courage, reframe fear, and act boldly in the face of uncertainty. In many ways, Lyft’s story provides a rich backdrop to test these ideas in action. And he’s also a fellow podcaster. Ranjay, welcome. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. Great to be here. BRIAN KENNY: You’re on the other side of the mic today. So, Ranjay hosts a show called Deep Purpose. You can find that on Apple or Spotify or wherever you listen, and it’s good to have you back on the show. It’s been too long. RANJAY GULATI: I know, Brian, it was great fun last time. I’m delighted to be back. BRIAN KENNY: This is a great case. I mean, we’ve all climbed into the back of a Lyft or an Uber, and those are the two major players, but by no means the only players in this space. So, the case actually comes in a little bit into their growth period where they’re facing some real significant challenges, and our protagonist is taking the helm there, and we’ll talk about all of that. So why don’t we just dive right in. I’m going to ask you to tell us what drew you to write about Lyft. Why did you think this would be a good case for the classroom, and what’s your cold call when you start the discussion? RANJAY GULATI: So, it’s interesting, when you write a case, you may start with one thing, and you may end up completely somewhere else. So, this is one of those stories where I started with a hypothesis about what the case was going to be about. It was really another illustration of a company that had a purpose as a founding principle and how they were trying to live by it. And the purpose was not to build a rideshare business. The purpose was to connect communities in places like Los Angeles, where the two founders were living. And so the idea was that a lot of people who don’t have access to a vehicle or parking or whatever are unable to connect, and it feels a fragmented, alienated life over there. So, this would be a way to bring people closer together. So, I was intrigued by how that kind of kernel of an idea became the basis of their strategy of how they were going to grow their business, about who they wanted to be. But then as I learned more, fast forward, what you discover is that for a variety of reasons, Uber comes into the picture, takes off, dominates, and suddenly now you are a one-third, two-third duopoly. Now, they’ve tried to differentiate and create some differentiation with their drivers and things like that, but even that is going away fast because the riders overlap across Uber and Lyft, so they’re not unique drivers anymore. Customers, you say, okay, I’m going to create stickiness for customers. Everybody has Uber and Lyft on their phone. They’re shopping across and choosing whoever’s the lowest price. Talk about commodity hell. So now what do you do? So, suddenly the case evolved from a study about just purpose to one about competing in commoditizing duopoly markets where the other competitor is bigger than you, has a more diverse revenue stream, can choose to make this a loss-leader. Now, how do you compete in this market? But then they became a third thing into the picture, which was now you have a new CEO. By the way, happens to be one of our alums, and he’s got to figure out, the founders are stepping away. Now you have this awkward transition where when founders set a step aside, professional management comes in and they got to figure out what do you do. BRIAN KENNY: What’s your cold call to start that discussion? RANJAY GULATI: I jump right into the case because I’ve had David Risher in class when I teach the case. So, I start by saying, “You’re David Risher. You’ve come into this business. What is your plan? What are you going to do in the first hundred days? What are you going to do in the first 300 days?” BRIAN KENNY: Wow. RANJAY GULATI: “And I want both plans nailed down, now.” BRIAN KENNY: That’s a brutal cold call. I wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of that. So, David is the HBS alum that you mentioned. He’s the protagonist in the case. He’s the one who stepped in to this leadership role in 2023. How would you characterize some of the dilemmas that he was facing? What was he up against? RANJAY GULATI: He was up against pretty significant headwinds because they had come through a particularly brutal COVID because they entirely depend on rideshare, which essentially came to a grinding halt and took a long time to recover back. Meanwhile, Uber had Uber Eats, which was actually a dramatic growth business in COVID. So, here you have a competitor who’s really gained in the previous period, and you are coming from a place of weakness, from a place where you don’t have reserves to go and invest in something big. And so limited resources, layoffs, morale. So, you’re coming through the shadow of darkness over here, while those guys have just rode the wave through, and now you’ve got to find a way. And commoditization has really taken off, because drivers, you have two customers, right? The drivers who are now agnostic between Lyft and Uber, not always the case before. BRIAN KENNY: So, David Risher comes into a culture that already exists. The founders of Lyft had a pretty specific vision for what they wanted to do, and any leader stepping into that role is going to face the challenge of the legacy but also trying to drive the culture forward. What were some of the things that David tried to do? RANJAY GULATI: One of the first things David had to do was overcome internal inertia. And I think somehow sometimes organizations that have a great idea and execute on the idea; they were more successful beyond their wildest of dreams. Even though Uber was even bigger, and Uber has gone global and done all these things, Lyft was very successful. And what does success do to some? Not all, is it makes them fall into what I loosely call the success trap. And the success trap is now you become so fearful of losing what you have, you stop trying to win. And when you do that, you are caught in a vicious cycle of inability to try and experiment, learn, fail, grow. And so, you’re caught in a market that is stagnating, homogenizing, and you are unable to innovate your way into something new. David’s opening letter, what he said about himself, his self-introduction, is also very important because that gives you a kernel of where he’s trying to go. His first point, he says, “Listen, I’ve worked in three organizations. I worked at Microsoft, Amazon, and at this nonprofit.” And he says, “The three things I’ve learned is at Microsoft, I learned about the power of innovation. Innovation is what allows you to be competitive in the marketplace.” He said, “From Amazon, I learned the importance of customer obsession, that you can’t just be customer-centric, you got to be obsessed. It’s an emotional thing, not just a rational thing.” And he said, “From my nonprofit days, I learned the power and importance of frugality, doing more with less. How do you get things done with limited resources?” So, he was going to bring these three perspectives into Lyft. BRIAN KENNY: What were some of the things that came out of that? What were some of the initiatives that he really focused on early on? RANJAY GULATI: So, one of the initiatives that actually was on the cards, they had already debated and discussed it. It wasn’t even David’s original thought, but they had set it aside for whatever reason was this idea of matching female passengers to female drivers. And this was going to be mutually beneficial because many female passengers prefer a female driver. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes sense. RANJAY GULATI: Given all the, in fact, recent tragic stories we’ve been hearing about attacks on passengers. So that was one. But even for the drivers, turned out that many female drivers would not drive rideshare, and they would instead do food delivery, even though you earn less in food delivery than in rideshare. But they felt it was less safe. BRIAN KENNY: I see. RANJAY GULATI: So, they were going to attract these drivers who were doing food share, food deliveries into rideshare saying, we will guarantee only female passengers. It was an idea they already had but for some reason hadn’t executed it. It reminded me of Anne Mulcahy story. Anne Mulcahy was the former CEO of Xerox, which legendarily owned Xerox, PARC and had all these innovations that Apple ran off with, which was the graphical user interface on the mouse. And she said in my class one time, “We didn’t launch products. They escaped from us.” And I don’t know why in some organizations you see that where the ideas may be there, they percolate around, people talk about them, they debate them, then the naysayers kick in, and somehow they get shelved. BRIAN KENNY: Right. Right. But it takes some bold leadership to actually revive that and push it through in an existing culture. How was David able to size up what he needed to do and move people in the same direction? Did he face opposition? RANJAY GULATI: In class, he’s talked about that. Yes, he did. But at least to jumpstart the process, leaders need to own it: OK, this is on me. This one’s on me, not on you. I’m not going to blame anybody else. This one’s on me. I own it. And that encourages others to then take ownership. And I think this willingness to step, you’re not going to become an autocrat and drive it constantly top down only. Eventually you’re going to build that confidence. I think people sometimes lose confidence. And then you need to boost up that confidence. And once you get them going, you’re then able to see the process unfold. And if you fast forward and see what Lyft has done in the last year and a half, you’ll see the positive results, the expansion into Europe, the now doing preferred driver choices, there’s a number of new things suddenly coming out of this company that actually was stagnating. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk about your new book because when I invited you to come on the show, I said, Is there a case that you think will help us to bring the ideas of your book to the surface? And you immediately landed on the Lyft case. Why does this case do a good job representing some of the big themes in your book? And maybe you can describe some of those themes to us. RANJAY GULATI: So, the book is called, How to Be Bold: The Science of Everyday Courage. The book is now about the individual level, two-thirds of the book about individual courage. And the last third is about organizational courage. But when I first began writing this book, it was about organizational courage. It was all about, How do you create courage? Now, when you think about the word “courage,” what is courage? Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is taking action in the face of fear. So, let’s get that out of the way. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, I like that. RANJAY GULATI: The second thing is now if it’s about action in the face of fear, fear is a primal human emotion that is hardwired in the reptilian brain. It’s a survival emotion: Get out of here, save yourself. Now the question is, what activates that? It turns out there’s great research showing that what activates fear is the situational context of uncertainty. When we encounter uncertainty, it instantly activates fear. Now, let me go back, unpeel the onion one more. What is uncertainty? There was a very famous essay by Frank Knight, the economist, on the distinction between risk and uncertainty. Risk is where you know the distribution of outcomes and you can put some probabilities on those outcomes. Uncertainty is, I don’t know. And if you look at present day and time, we are in an era of unprecedented uncertainty. In fact, in a recent article, somebody analyzed earnings calls by CEOs and found that in the last quarter, CEOs mentioned the word “uncertainty” three times as often as they did in the previous quarter. So, the word is out there; we all feeling it. When we experience uncertainty, the natural normal human response is one of fear. Now, the question then is, do we let fear take over? Because fear left to its own devices hijacks the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. And the typical response is one of freeze or flight. Now, if you look at Lyft back then, I didn’t interview them back then, so I don’t know what it was exactly like, but my hypothesis is that it had a freeze response. They were stuck and unable to do much about it. You’re in a market that is rapidly commoditizing. You have a competitor who is much bigger than you, who has diversified their income streams, and so is not totally reliant on this one business, which is the US ridesharing business. What are you going to do? So, to understand this strategic lock or freeze, you got to really understand organizations too have collective emotion, and fear becomes a paralyzing emotion unless you’re willing to face it. BRIAN KENNY: So, how does a leader go in and get people to have collective courage? You talk about collective courage in the case. It comes up in the book, I’m sure. How do you stoke that within an organization? RANJAY GULATI: So, let me give you an example from sports. One of the guests I had in my class many years ago now was Sir Alex Ferguson, the coach of Manchester United, the former legendary coach of Manchester United, for those who don’t know who he is. And one of the things he comments he made in class was that one of the hardest things he has to do as a coach is to take a winning team and make them come back and want to win again. So, somebody said, what do you mean? Are they lazy and complacent now they’ve won a championship? Because he won several. And that’s why in all sports, basketball, football, it’s very hard to see back-to-back championship. And he said, no, you know what happens is instead of playing to win, they start to play not to lose. They’re so fearful of losing. In sports terms, they’ll have the ball possession, but they’ll hold it in their half. They’ll defend more than play offense. And so you go into this defensive posture. So how do you unlock the organization to play offense, to look for opportunities for growth, to take calculated bets, to even walk into uncertainty because it is scary to do things that might not work, right? We want to de-risk it. We teach that stuff. Risk mitigation, risk management, we’re all about risk. Most of business is about risk. BRIAN KENNY: But back to your point about uncertainty, risk brings uncertainty. RANJAY GULATI: But they are separate ideas also. They’re adjacent, but separate ideas. How do we as leaders create the capacity in an organization to face uncertainty, to tackle the fear that is a natural correlate of that uncertainty and put the organization on a playing to win posture? That’s the leader’s challenge. How do you get them thinking upbeat? I’ll give you another example. I’m just finishing a case right now on a totally different company. It’s called Boston Scientific. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: Boston Scientific, in 2010, 11-odd, had done the second worst acquisition ever. They had acquired after AOL, Time Warner. Their acquisition of Guidant was the second worst acquisition, a $27 billion company. They had acquired Guidant for $28 billion. And the two together in a matter of a few years would be worth $4 or $5 billion. Massive destruction of value. So, in comes another CEO, and what is his tagline when he takes over? Winning spirit. Got to start to win again. And once you start to win again, winning is addictive. People want to win. People want to be on a winning team. You just got to give them a taste for what winning is. How do you jump start that? Yes, you need a brilliant strategy. Yes, you need to focus. Yes, you need to think about adjacencies for growth. Yes, you need to be customer obsessed. Yes, you got to figure out what are innovative ways to brand yourself in the market. But there’s an undercurrent beneath all that, which is this winning spirit. How do you get that going? BRIAN KENNY: And you mentioned that Lyft has seen some wins over the last few years. So, winning begets more winning, right? Winning gives you confidence. It makes you feel like you can do it. If you look at David Risher and what he did, are there examples in your book that you can point to that illustrate some of the things that David was able to do, examples of courage or infusing this winning spirit? RANJAY GULATI: So, you mentioned the word “confidence,” and there’s a very famous Stanford psychologist named Albert Bandura who studied something, an adjacent idea called self-efficacy, which relates to confidence. And it turns out that this idea of efficacy and confidence comes in two flavors. One is domain specific. We know our industry, we know our business, we know what we need to do. Now let’s just go do it, right? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: And David saw plenty of that in spades, I’m sure. But beneath that is another generalized form of self-efficacy. It’s a can-do mindset. No matter what comes our way, no matter what curve balls come our way, no matter how many setbacks we have, we got it. We can do it. And that can-do mindset, which is this generalized form of self-efficacy, which is, if you remember Apollo 13, Eugene Kranz tells his team, they have no textbook for this. There’s no manuals for the situation. Oxygen tanks have blown up. And now you have your command module, the LEM, the lunar entry module floating towards the moon. You’re going to use it as a life raft and slingshot their way back to earth. No one even simulated that idea. What does he say in his first meeting? Failure is not an option. Because people are like, oh my God, can’t do it, impossible, hopeless. So, how do you as a leader imbue in your team? Failure is not an option. We’ll have setbacks. We’ll make mistakes. BRIAN KENNY: But let me ask you this. When you say failure is not an option, one of the things we’ve talked about many times on Cold Call with different cases is that you have to allow for failure. You have to create a culture where failure is acceptable so that people are willing to take a chance to innovate in some way. RANJAY GULATI: Absolutely. Great observation. And so, you’re right, idea here is ultimate failure is not an option. BRIAN KENNY: Got it. RANJAY GULATI: But along the way, and you’re right, as we know about making it safe to fail and learning from that failure is critical to the journey of courage. And what is interesting about this, I’ll give you a nuanced idea that I also talk about in the book, is if you look at some of these leaders, including David Risher, I would imagine, how do you not only make it safe to fail, but how do you also deal with success? Because success itself can be complacency inducing. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: So, I think that is the challenge David is going to have now, now that they have some wins under their belt. That’s why you have people who fade away as athletes, just a taste of success and they’re like, OK, I’m done. And you know when I learned that was actually, I wrote a case and I talk about him in the book is Nick Saban, who’s the legendary coach of the University of Alabama football team. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: For those who don’t know him, this guy was unprecedented in terms of his record, everything else. And he has this model he called the process. It’s actually very Eastern spiritual in some ways. He wouldn’t say that. But because the idea is focused on the process, not on the outcome. And he learned that when he was coach at Michigan State and he was about to play Ohio State, which was much better team than theirs. And he went up and met a psychologist in the psych department and said, “I want to know how can I coach my team?” And the gentleman told him, he said, “Listen, just make them focus on each play, not on the score.” At halftime, they were way behind. At halftime, he called the team and said, “Don’t forget what I said to you. Don’t look at the score.” Miraculous turnaround, came and beat Ohio State. So that stayed with him. Losing and winning can confuse and distract you. So, at one level, you are intensely focused on winning, at another, you’re not letting it cloud your thinking. And I’ll share a small other example is Scottie Scheffler, golfer, you would know. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: He was paired up with Tiger Woods at the Masters. On the 12th hole, which is the par three, Tiger hit a 10. He had two balls in the water. It’s one of the lowest scores ever on that hole. He was immediately out of contention of the tournament, and Scheffler was shocked. But the next five holes, Tiger birdied them. It was like nothing had ever happened. Nothing had happened. So how do you face up to failure? How do you face up to fear? I think athletics, sports, there’s a lot of metaphor and real visual stories about that. BRIAN KENNY: Right, of course. RANJAY GULATI: I think for David coming into the job, I think before you get to strategy, he had this one idea. He put it out there and said, jumpstart guys, we can do it. Build up some confidence, self-confidence. We can do it. I think the hardest thing was to help them come out of this malaise where they were just lost. But having a one-off idea is not going to do it. Then you’ve got to build a strategy. So, for him, the next thing or piece of the puzzle was, what’s going to be our strategy? Everyone wants to have clear direction. Then how do you build conviction around that direction? At the same time, you’re doing all this you’re trying to jumpstart and revive your culture to be more performance and results and outcome focused. While you’re doing this with your, you’re trying to also focus on your brand and think about customers. How do customers experience you? A lot of times companies, his idea of customer obsession is also an important piece of the puzzle to think about. To me, what’s surprising from an earlier era of research I had done on customer-centric organizations, it’s fascinating how quickly companies, organizations, forget about their customer. Customers become an abstraction, a data point, a number, a market segment. You’re not thinking tangibly about customers. And in the case of a two-sided marketplace, which is what Lyft is, their customers are both the drivers and the passengers, and they don’t both always want the same thing. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: So how do you really build a customer obsession? So, your strategy, your culture, your actions, your winning is all connected to this thought process of customer obsession. So, I mentioned to you three things that David said he brought to the table. First was innovation, got to get the innovation engine going with a winning spirit. Second was customer obsession. Start thinking about our customers, both sides of them. And then the third one was frugality. In a market that is getting commoditized fast, and you don’t have scale advantage, which is what Uber has over them, you got to find a way to be frugal. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: Organizations struggle to subtract. And I think his frugality thinking is a way to understand that where should Lyft subtract so that they can add also. So, you’re playing addition, subtraction. How do you undertake both simultaneously? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I would imagine the overarching situation that any leader faces stepping into that kind of a role is how hard do I push? How do I balance all the things we’re trying to do so that the organization can withstand what we’re doing? RANJAY GULATI: Pacing change is another, you’ve now- BRIAN KENNY: You could write a whole book about that. RANJAY GULATI: Yeah, that’s a whole different topic, but I think it’s such a critical one. So, I think it’s really important to keep in mind that pacing change is the other piece of the puzzle. Building capacity to enact those changes. You can’t push it too fast, but you can’t push it too slow. So how do you pace that change coming in becomes very, very important. You need to build momentum, and this positive momentum becomes another key part of the puzzle. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Ranjay, this has been a great, you’ve given me a lot to think about, great conversation as I knew it would be. I’ve got one question for you before we end our conversation, which is simply, if you’d like our listeners to remember one thing about the Lyft case and about David Risher, what would it be? RANJAY GULATI: Courage is a source of competitive advantage. It is going to be the currency in times of uncertainty, because courage allows you to lean into that uncertainty and the fear that comes with it. It allows us to become comfortable with uncertainty. It allows us to, as you’ve heard many times from me in our conversation before, it’s okay with being scared. How do we learn to live with fear and make it a partner and a source of energy rather than want to freeze up? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I love that. Ranjay, your new book is, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage. Thanks for joining me. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. As always, it was lovely to talk to you.

Title: Hyperliquid Turns Up The HYPE —And The Heat On Circle’s USDC
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonegilsson/2025/09/16/hyperliquid-turns-up-the-hype--and-the-heat-on-circles-usdc/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T11:48:15Z
Full Content:
ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. HYPE, the governance token of Hyperliquid—a decentralized trading platform—has surged more than 1,500% in less than a year, reaching a market cap of $16 billion. Appropriately named, HYPE now sits at the center of a shift in stablecoins. Yesterday, Native Markets was selected through a validator vote to issue USDH, Hyperliquid’s first native stablecoin. The decision matters less for the issuer itself — a relatively new player — than for what it signals: stablecoin economics are changing, and established issuers such as Circle, whose USDC dominates Hyperliquid today, may feel the pressure. Hyperliquid holds about $5.97 billion in USDC balances, equal to roughly 8.2% of USDC’s total supply. Based on current federal funds rates, those deposits would generate more than $250 million annually in interest income for Circle and its partner Coinbase. USDH is designed to redirect that yield into Hyperliquid’s own ecosystem. If adoption succeeds, Circle could lose a substantial revenue stream while Hyperliquid strengthens its independence from external providers. Circle knows the stakes. CEO Jeremy Allaire responded on X: “Don’t Believe the Hype… We are coming to the HYPE ecosystem in a big way. We intend to be a major player and contributor to the ecosystem.” As Lucas Tcheyan of Galaxy Digital observed: “The competition for USDH underscores a shifting dynamic in stablecoin issuance where issuers must increasingly pay for distribution. Issuers are portraying themselves as indispensable partners, but in reality, they need Hyperliquid more than Hyperliquid needs them.” The process drew proposals from well-known names such as Paxos, Frax, Ethena, Sky (formerly MakerDAO), and Agora. Most offered to return nearly all reserve income — up to 100% — to win the mandate. Native Markets took a different approach, pledging a 50/50 split: half of the yield will go to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, which buys back HYPE, and half to ecosystem growth initiatives. So it’s not all going to HYPE — but HYPE is still the clear beneficiary. Buybacks directly support the token, while ecosystem programs are intended to encourage wider use of USDH, reinforcing the same outcome. CoinGecko’s Vera Lim noted: “The outcome demonstrates the importance of ecosystem alignment and native knowledge over pure financial incentives in DeFi governance decisions.” The reserves will be managed through Stripe’s Bridge platform, with custody by BlackRock. Both MiCAR in Europe and the GENIUS Act in the U.S. prohibit stablecoins from paying interest to stablecoin holders. The aim is to ensure these instruments act as payment tools rather than investment products, and to protect bank deposits. On the surface, USDH complies. It is redeemable at par and pays no interest to holders. But in practice, the reserve income will be rerouted through HYPE buybacks and ecosystem subsidies. This is why some see the design as a circumvention of the rules. Yes, regulators prohibited stablecoins from paying yield directly; Hyperliquid has instead created a structure where the yield supports a governance token tied to the stablecoin’s adoption. Functionally, it introduces the same incentives regulators wanted to avoid. But the parallel with corporate America, including Circle, is worth noting. USDC holders receive no yield, but Circle’s shareholders benefit when USDC grows, since the company invests reserves in Treasuries. The difference is that Hyperliquid’s model makes the link explicit, folding it into the economics of its governance token. For readers unfamiliar with the platform, Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on its own blockchain. It has quickly become the leading venue for decentralized perpetual futures, with around 70% market share and monthly volumes approaching $400 billion. Until now, the network has relied almost entirely on USDC. That dependency has meant billions in deposits flow to Circle and Coinbase, even though the activity is generated within Hyperliquid. USDH is intended to capture that value internally while reducing reliance on external, permissioned stablecoins. The USDH vote points to three broader trends. First, issuers must now increasingly pay for adoption. Stablecoins are no longer judged only by trust in the issuer but by how much value is returned to the ecosystems where they circulate. Second, regulation lags design. MiCAR and GENIUS assume stablecoins can be kept in a non-interest-bearing model. USDH shows how quickly new structures can emerge that satisfy the letter of the rules while challenging their intent. Third, governance tokens matter. HYPE’s 1,533% surge reflects not just speculation but the market’s expectation that yield, even if banned on paper, will find its way back to users and investors through other channels. The 50/50 split ensures not all yield goes to HYPE, but it leaves the token as the central beneficiary. On paper, Native Markets won the USDH mandate. In practice, the validator vote underscored how stablecoins are evolving into ecosystems where yield is too valuable to leave untouched. MiCAR and GENIUS sought to prevent stablecoins from competing with bank deposits by banning interest payments. USDH shows how difficult that goal will be to enforce. The design makes a formal distinction between “money” and “investment,” yet blurs it in substance by turning stablecoin adoption into a source of yield for the community — a role once reserved for bank deposits.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Ad fraud hasn’t gone away – it’s getting more widespread with AI

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → First off, few readers will need reminding how the remedies phase of Google’s ad tech trial kicks off next week. After the widespread disappointment of the earlier ruling in the parallel search trial, Digiday wants your opinion on what the most likely opinion will be, so please share your opinion in a quick poll here – it will take less than a minute of your time. That brings us to the topic of ad fraud, an activity that came to mainstream attention with news of convictions for such activity in the early 2020s. However, as today’s report from cybersecurity firm HUMAN shows, it’s not a problem that’s gone away. Earlier today, it disclosed details of what it characterizes as one of the more sophisticated mobile ad fraud operations uncovered to date. The scheme, dubbed “SlopAds,” relied on hundreds of apps distributed via Google Play and generated billions of fraudulent bid requests before its takedown, with the firm unable to share estimates of how much it cost advertisers. The latest SlopAds investigation involved at least 224 apps collectively downloaded more than 38 million times across 228 countries, with much of this activity originating in the United States, India and Brazil, per the company. At its height, the network generated an estimated 2.3 billion daily bid requests, according to HUMAN’s technical report, with the “Slop” moniker reflecting both the mass-produced nature of the apps and their recurring AI-themed branding, a veneer that belied the underlying mechanics. An extensive infrastructure of command-and-control servers and promotional domains supported the apps. SlopAds went beyond conventional click fraud. Once downloaded, the apps performed checks to avoid detection, distinguishing between organic and non-organic installs. Fraudulent behavior only triggered if an app had been downloaded after a user clicked on an ad. In practice, that meant the app behaved benignly for users who installed it directly, but activated hidden modules for those who arrived via ads. The fraud module, dubbed FatModule, was delivered through digital steganography. Four PNG image files concealed fragments of code that, when reassembled on a device, executed the fraud logic. The apps also deployed anti-analysis techniques such as debugging checks, string encryption and packed native code. From there, the operation relied on hidden WebViews, stripped-down browsers that collected device data and navigated to “cashout” domains controlled by the threat actors. These WebViews rendered ads and auto-clicked them, with repeated redirects sanitizing referral data to simulate legitimate traffic. In some cases, the fraud targeted HTML5 game and news websites, echoing tactics seen in other operations like BADBOX 2.0. HUMAN described SlopAds’ use of attribution and measurement tools as a novel obfuscation tactic. By piggybacking on attribution tags, the apps could confirm whether an install was organic or not without writing custom tools. In an email exchange, Lindsay Kaye, vp of threat intelligence, HUMAN, told Digiday the technique did not involve compromising SDKs. Instead, the bad actors involved leveraged attribution, highlighting how legitimate systems can be co-opted. Asked whether buyers should question the reliability of attribution platforms, Kaye replied, “The exploitation of the attribution system by SlopAds was not done in such a way that it should make buyers question the reliability of the tool. Rather, the threat actors used it in its intended fashion.” As for which sell-side or demand-side platforms were most exposed, HUMAN declined to disclose details, although Kaye claimed media teams should encourage partners in their ad tech supply chain to use more sophisticated tools to detect invalid traffic. Google removed all identified SlopAds apps from its Play Store, according to HUMAN, with Android’s Play Protect security service now blocking apps exhibiting similar behaviors, although it claimed the scheme involved tens of millions of downloads before removal. “HUMAN not only provides this filtration, but also surfaces granular insights into specific supply that may indicate quality concerns,” added Kaye. HUMAN researchers said they expect the operators of SlopAds to adapt and redeploy, given the investment in infrastructure and indications that they were testing new apps even during the investigation. The company said it continues to monitor for further activity. The broader takeaway for advertisers is that fraud tactics are increasingly conditional, sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. SlopAds shows that threat actors are willing to borrow tools from the legitimate ad tech stack — from attribution to steganography — to cloak their operations. For buyers, this raises questions not just about fraud detection, but about how much confidence to place in the signals underpinning programmatic decisions. While HUMAN clients were insulated, industry-wide exposure remains unclear, underscoring the asymmetry of information between security vendors and buyers. As fraudsters adapt, the SlopAds case highlights a familiar but intensifying theme: programmatic buying remains an attractive target, and bad actors are hiding in plain sight as AI slop becomes more commonplace. ‘Quite frankly, ignorant’: Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale rebukes The Trade Desk’s SSP ‘reseller’ tag The Trade Desk’s reclassification of all supply-side platforms as “resellers” faces pushback from major players like Index Exchange, who call it an oversimplification. This reclassification penalizes SSPs by scoring their inventory as less efficient, diverting ad spend to The Trade Desk’s direct supply paths. While aiming to cut inefficiencies, critics argue it consolidates The Trade Desk’s control, reducing money for some SSPs and publishers, though others benefit from favored integrations like OpenPath. This shift is reshaping industry dynamics. Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy Netflix will sell ads via Amazon’s DSP in 12 markets, completing programmatic integration. Amazon’s commerce data offers advertisers unique targeting power, while discounted fees strengthen its appeal. The move helps Netflix ease buying and boost performance, as Amazon positions itself as the central hub of streaming’s growing ad economy. “This is actually going to be a problem for second-tier demand-side platforms. As ‘open web’ declines, you need to get in with the ‘hedged gardens.’” – An anonymous source reacts to news that “Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy.” A development that had a calamitous impact on The Trade Desk’s stock price. What’s next for Streamr.ai now that it’s been acquired by Magnite? Magnite announced it had acquired Streamr.ai, which specializes in developing AI-generated assets for small businesses to use in their CTV campaigns. Magnite CPO Adam Soroca explains more to AdExchanger. Scope3 lays off staff as part of shift toward agentic advertising Adweek discusses layoffs at the startup led by Brian O’Kelley. While the number of layoffs wasn’t confirmed in the piece, sources told Digiday the number was close to 20%, with the cuts impacting multiple departments, including former senior European leadership. With GAM going direct to buyers, SPO is the new normal Adexchanger riffs on an earlier story by The Information, looking at Google’s sell-side business, a.k.a. Google Ad Manager, pursuit of direct deals with the buy side – the implication being that demand-side platforms, including Google’s own DV360, would be cut out. GAM representatives recently hosted a dinner for top ad agencies in New York City in July to discuss ways that GAM could work directly with buyers. Is Google preparing to make Its ad tech biz independent? Emarketer’s analyst team does likewise, instead explaining how Google’s preparations reflect regulatory pressure following Judge Brinkema’s April ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges. Regulators might force Google to divest GAM or sell its AdX exchange to increase competition. Despite a 7% revenue decline in network revenue, Google remains dominant with $205 billion forecasted ad revenues for 2025, but its slowed growth and antitrust challenges threaten industry dynamics and competitors. Beginning next year, Best Buy will offer “takeover packages” to allow advertisers to appear throughout the in-store shopping experience. The deal comes a week after Amazon announced a similar deal with Netflix, causing the stock price of rival DSP The Trade Desk to falter. The platform is rolling out broadly to both agencies and small- and mid-sized businesses that are looking to control more of their media investment destiny.

Title: Franklin Templeton Bets Blockchain Will Transform Asset Management
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christerholloman/2025/09/16/franklin-templeton-bets-blockchain-will-transform-asset-management/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T10:00:00Z

ByChrister Holloman, Contributor. The payments and asset management industries are undergoing a fundamental reset. A report from McKinsey published last this summer finds that stablecoins and tokenized cash are emerging as serious challengers to incumbent infrastructure, with transaction volumes forecast to reach as much as $250 billion per day within three years. That inflection point is forcing banks, asset managers, and technology providers to move quickly or risk irrelevance. Few incumbents are leaning in as aggressively as Franklin Templeton. The firm’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, says blockchain technology is not a side project but a new foundation for how securities, funds, and collateral will be issued, traded, and managed. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton Bayston recalls that Franklin Templeton’s early work in the space was pure R&D. The question was basic: What could distributed ledgers do for an asset manager? The answer was equally basic at first, eliminate costly reconciliations and duplicative ledgers that plague capital markets. But once the regulatory picture began to shift in the U.S. earlier this year, the firm moved from exploration to commercialization. “The biggest challenge we faced for years was the regulatory construct,” Bayston said. “That changed dramatically after the first of the year. Now it’s about focus, delivery, and scaling what we’ve incubated into real products.” Franklin Templeton’s showcase product is Benji, the blockchain-enabled representation of its U.S. Government Money Fund. Instead of holding shares in a brokerage account, investors hold a token in a digital wallet. Transfers are nearly instantaneous, and the fund pays intraday yield calculated down to the second, a feature impossible in legacy systems. While the concept may sound niche, demand is growing. Early adopters include crypto-native firms and exchanges looking for a yield-bearing alternative to stablecoins in collateral management. Bayston noted that these clients want to post collateral that earns income, not sit idle. In practice, that means Benji can slot into derivatives and lending markets where stablecoins dominate today. McKinsey’s report highlights exactly this convergence. Yield-bearing, tokenized cash equivalents are becoming popular complements to traditional stablecoins, with Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Ondo among the early movers. For Bayston, tokenization is not just about faster money funds. It is about transforming what investors can own, “We’ve updated transfer agency infrastructure with blockchain,” he said. “Now, previously illiquid or non-fungible assets, from private funds to fractional ownership of a sports team, can potentially be wrapped into a client portfolio alongside traditional securities.” Natalya Thakur, is CEO of Knova which provides the API infrastructure layer that unifies traditional and tokenized assets, helping institutions manage, automate, and transact across all asset types in real time and she commented, “Franklin Templeton’s launch of Benji shows how tokenization is making even the most traditional products, like government money funds, more dynamic and interoperable. Institutions are seeking to integrate tokenized and traditional assets into a single operational stack, where yields can be optimized and collateral can move instantly. Tokenized funds like Benji will thrive when paired with infrastructure that lets firms orchestrate them side-by-side with securities, stablecoins, and deposits.” That idea echoes McKinsey’s thesis that tokenized money, deposits, and securities could reshape capital markets, treasury operations, and even cross-border remittances. The implications extend beyond cost savings to entirely new product categories and customer segments. Franklin Templeton has already launched multiple versions of Benji, including U.S. and European Union structures. Early traction is strongest in crypto-native markets where the instrument is used as collateral, but Bayston envisions adoption in public markets as regulations catch up. He points to recent developments like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation and the U.S. GENIUS Act as accelerants. With clearer rules, tokenized funds can coexist with, or even displace, stablecoins in mainstream financial plumbing. Bayston avoids bold five-year predictions, but he is confident about the near term. Franklin Templeton has built a tokenization platform across public and private funds. The next step is deploying it widely across its asset management businesses. “We know the wallet ecosystems have hundreds of millions of customers we don’t touch today,” Bayston said. “Meeting their needs is a tremendous opportunity for us.” The McKinsey report argues that 2025 could be the year stablecoins and tokenized assets cross into the financial mainstream. For Franklin Templeton, the shift is already underway. By blending plain-vanilla money funds with blockchain rails, the firm is proving that tokenization is not just a theory but a functioning business model. If other incumbents hesitate, they may find themselves disrupted not by fintechs but by peers willing to rewire their infrastructure for the digital era.

Hi OP, Is this prescription glass or normal? Is prescription glass additional cost? F @the eyewear guy would be great for this to be answered Price is for the nom prescription model. Lenses are additional. We don’t have any further info about the prescription lenses available in these meta until 23rd September. Zukko bought oakley? Meta acquired nearly 3% of EssilorLuxottica, which is the parent company of both Ray-Ban and Oakley. Big difference between the gen1 rayban meta compared to gen2. The tech will evolve rapidly with meta onboard I think. Launches 23/9? I've already had mine nearly 3 weeks - bought from Meta site…. that's the limited edition version that only comes in 1 colourway, I think? which is of course only limited to sunglass version Which of these have the HUD in one eye? Seems like it's just the regular Glasses style that already existed. What's new if anything about this? Oakley META frames are the smart-enabled version of Oakley’s everyday frame. They incl Bluetooth audio, voice controls, and touch controls, but do not have integrated HUD or any display in the lens. Oakley’s previous “HUD” product was the now discontinued Oakley Airwave (for snow goggles), not the META line. So the answer is: none of the Oakley META glasses have a HUD in one eye.

Title: Google owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visit

Time Published: 2025-09-16T05:12:57Z
Full Content:
The world's fourth-biggest company, Google owner Alphabet, has announced a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI). The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were "profound opportunities in the UK" for its "pioneering work in advanced science". The company will officially open a $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday. The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. Ms Porat said there was "now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science". She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said "there's still work to be done to land that", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom "was not a foregone conclusion". Reeves said the investment was "a powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy" and showed "the strength of our partnership with the US". The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an "AI First" business, with Ms Porat saying, "it's that performance which has resulted in that metric". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat "captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply "95% carbon-free energy" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but "obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day". Energy efficiency was being built into "all aspects of AI" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to "modernise the grid" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was "spending a lot of time" focused on the AI jobs challenge. "It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy." But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: "AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. "Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines," she said. A coalition of more than 50 groups have organised a march in central London against the visit. US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania are in the UK for an unprecedented second state visit. President Trump greeted by the King and Queen and other senior royals at Windsor Castle. The Liberal Democrat leader says the UK's pharmaceutical industry is under "attack". The US president's second state visit will see a crowded mix of royal pageantry, trade talks and international politics. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Google-owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visit

The world's fourth-biggest company, Google owner Alphabet, has announced a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI). The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were "profound opportunities in the UK" for its "pioneering work in advanced science". The company will officially open a $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday. The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. Ms Porat said there was "now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science". She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said "there's still work to be done to land that", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom "was not a foregone conclusion". Reeves said the investment was "a powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy" and showed "the strength of our partnership with the US". The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an "AI First" business, with Ms Porat saying, "it's that performance which has resulted in that metric". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat "captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply "95% carbon-free energy" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but "obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day". Energy efficiency was being built into "all aspects of AI" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to "modernise the grid" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was "spending a lot of time" focused on the AI jobs challenge. "It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy." But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: "AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. "Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines," she said. A coalition of more than 50 groups have organised a march in central London against the visit. US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania are in the UK for an unprecedented second state visit. President Trump greeted by the King and Queen and other senior royals at Windsor Castle. The Liberal Democrat leader says the UK's pharmaceutical industry is under "attack". The US president's second state visit will see a crowded mix of royal pageantry, trade talks and international politics. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Coinbase’s XRP Decline Continues: 90% Crash In Exchange’s Reserves Tells Story Of Investor Accumulation
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinbases-xrp-decline-continues/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:46Z
Full Content:
Coinbase’s XRP reserves have witnessed one of the strongest collapses among major crypto exchanges, and this has caused questions as to where the tokens are going. According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket. Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Rolling Regressions in Clojure for Real-Time Alpha and Beta Monitoring
URL: https://clojurecivitas.github.io/finance/portfolio_analysis/alpha_beta_regression.html
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:00Z

Edward Widjaja cim Tanvi Nagar cim Matthias Buehlmaier cim September 16, 2025 This blog post presents a functional, reproducible implementation of rolling regression in Clojure to estimate time-varying alpha(α) and beta(β) for student-managed portfolios at the Centre for Investment Management (CIM), The University of Hong Kong. Unlike traditional CAPM tests based on passive index data, our analysis uses actual(synthetic) trades executed by junior portfolio managers- undergraduate students who manage simulated equity portfolios over multiple semesters. We use hypothetical trade data from student portfolio managers at the Centre for Investment Management, including: ● Trade dates, tickers, shares, prices ● Portfolio valuations over time(monthly rebalancing) ● Cash flows and position weights ● Returns are computed at the portfolio level, aggregated monthly from individual holdings. ● Benchmark: S&P 500 total return index ● Excess returns are calculated for both portfolios and the market. ● The risk free rate is omitted from analysis for ease of understanding concepts since it does not affect the final results presented in this proposal For each student portfolio, we estimate the CAPM regression over a rolling 12- or 24-month window: Using ordinary least squares(OLS), we obtain a time series of: ● Alpha(α): time-varying abnormal return(skill or luck?) ● Beta(β): evolving sensitivity to market movements(risk awareness?) ● Windows slide forward monthly, producing a dynamic view of performance. The full analysis pipeline is implemented in Clojure, designed for clarity, reuse, and integration into teaching workflows. Below are some core libraries that were used in the project. ● generateme/fastmath: for OLS regression and statistical operations ● scicloj/tablecloth: for data preparation and transformation ● clj-python/libpython-clj: to fetch price data using the yfinance library in Python ● org.clojure/data.csv: for inputting securities for analysis ● org.clojure/clojure.data.json: to parse JSON strings The below function uses a simple Python script (with the help of clj-python to integrate Python with Clojure) to fetch open and closing prices for NVIDIA stocks and the S&P 500 Index from Yahoo Finance. We can then obtain data as follows: Using the scicloj/tablecloth library, we transform our data, obtaining the stock and market closing prices and their dates. We continue with creating functions to calculate arithmetic returns, and calculating the day-by-day returns for the stock and the market. Now, this is where we implement our rolling market model, where we regress NVDA stock returns on the market returns using a rolling window to obtain sets of alpha and beta. To achieve this, we utilize the generateme/fastmath library to implement our very own rolling window regression function. Finally, we use these functions to obtain our sets of alpha and beta. Note that the size of the window is 252 to represent the number of trading days in a year. We present time-series plots of alpha and beta for multiple student portfolios across two academic years. While stock prices reflect market consensus, alpha and beta decompose returns into risk-adjusted components, revealing whether performance was due to systematic market exposure(beta) or true outperformance(alpha). This provides deeper insight than price alone, enabling informed evaluation of risk, skill, and value creation. The above charts show the alpha over time for NVDA(Nvidia) and the historical alpha tracking can help inform future trades. A close-up analysis of alpha reveals some interesting observations, for example: ● The declining trend in NVIDIA’s(NVDA) alpha relative to the S&P 500, as observed from October 2023 to July 2025, reflects a significant shift in the stock’s market performance dynamics. ● Initially exhibiting strong positive alpha-indicative of substantial outperformance over the broader market-NVDA’s excess return diminished steadily over time, converging toward zero by mid-2025. ● This erosion of alpha can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the normalization of AI-driven valuation premiums, increased competitive pressures from semiconductor peers, and a broader market environment characterized by robust S&P 500 performance that reduced NVDA’s relative advantage. Similarly, the above charts reveals some trends regarding the beta of the NVDA(Nvidia) stock: ● The time series of NVIDIA’s(NVDA) beta relative to the S&P 500 reveals a significant evolution in the stock’s sensitivity to market movements over the period from October 2023 to August 2025. ● Initially, NVDA exhibited a beta around 2.0, indicating that it was approximately twice as volatile as the broader market. Over the course of 2024, beta steadily increased, peaking near 2.9 in early 2025, reflecting heightened market exposure and amplified price swings during periods of strong investor enthusiasm for AI-driven growth. ● This elevated beta suggests that NVDA was behaving as a high-risk, high-reward asset, with returns highly correlated to-and often magnified by-market trends. However, beginning in April 2025, beta experienced a sharp decline, falling to 1.985 by August 2025, signaling a reduction in its volatility relative to the market. This decrease may reflect a combination of factors: valuation corrections, reduced speculative positioning, and a shift toward more stable, earnings-driven investment behavior. Hence, a portfolio manager when looking at the historical performance of NVDA, will be able to evaluate if the trade is adding value to their portfolio. A stock with a rising alpha and lower beta is a good sign for investment, since it presents a higher return for a lower level of risk. An evaluation of single stocks comprising a portfolio will give a good visual analysis of the stocks risk and return and the overall portfolio. A similar analysis can be conducted at the portfolio level as well to understand the portfolio manager’s performance- alpha creation against the market similar to an AMC tracking a fund’s performance. Rolling alpha and beta are not just statistics-they are mirrors. They allow students to: ● See the consequences of their strategies ● Distinguish luck from skill ● Adjust risk in response to market regimes This system has direct real-world applicability: ● Can be scaled to real fund management with minimal changes ● Provides a template for risk dashboards in small asset managers ● Integrates with automated compliance or alerting(e.g., “beta increased by 30% this month”) By turning student trades into living data, we move beyond theory to reflective practice. And by building in Clojure, we ensure that the system is not a black box—but an open book. In simple words we can decipher, the best financial models don’t just describe the world—they help people learn from it. ● Expand to multi-factor rolling models(e.g., FF3: market, size, value) ● Build a web dashboard using ClojureScript(Reagent) for real-time feedback and interactivity ● Implement automated alerts(e.g., “your beta has exceeded 1.5”) ● Add peer benchmarking: compare alpha trajectories across students ● Integrate with portfolio optimization tools for next-step recommendations ● Use the pipeline as a capstone module in investment management courses

Title: Should We Ban Quarterly Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2025/09/15/should-we-ban-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T23:53:55Z

ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. The move confuses corporate investing myopia with the frequency of reporting One of the new policy initiatives that has garnered much attention is to cancel quarterly reporting by publicly listed firms. The motivation appears to be the need to get out of “quarterly capitalism” or CEOs focused on beating quarterly estimates of EPS, instead of worrying about beating overseas firms that have a much longer horizon of decades when they make investment decisions. 1.0 This was tried in the UK Before we do anything, it is useful to learn from the experience of other advanced markets that have tried this before. The UK, in 2014, banned mandatory quarterly reporting and went to a six-monthly cycle. My co-authors, Suresh Nallareddy, and Bob Pozen, and I studied the observable consequences of that change. Here is what we found: 2,0 Will less frequent reporting curb the real causes of investment myopia, if any? Part of the confusion stems from the real causes of investment myopia. In my mind, the real policy problems, underlying investment myopia, are as follows: 2.1 Expensing investments in intangible assets Capital market participants pay attention to earnings numbers. Earnings numbers, in the US, co-mingle signals about current operating performance and investment outlays. That is, investment in R&D and human capital in SG&A lines are expensed as per US GAAP. This leads, all else constant, to cutting investment outlays in intangibles to make the earnings numbers look good. Expanding the reporting window to six months will not improve investments, as we found. Why? Most investments have a three year or a five-year payoff horizon. Are we willing to allow firms to report once in three to five years? Most likely not. 2.2 A company’s investors are rarely that company’s frequent traders In my class, I often show students the list of a firm’s top 10-25 owners relative to funds that traded the most quarter. The largest owners for big companies are predictably the large index funds such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. Traders are usually hedge funds. Going to half yearly reporting might potentially lead to even more trading by hedge funds who are more interested in predicting near term stock price changes rather than long term fundamentals. This may even lead to greater opportunities for managers to exploit inside information to time their trades or the firms’ financing activities. 2.3 CEO and CFO tenure is down CEO and CFO tenure in the US are at historic lows, at six and four years respectively, for all sorts of reasons other than reporting frequency. If your expected term with a firm is 16 quarters, of course quarterly reporting matters. Many CEOs I have chatted with complain that it will take five to six years for any of their investment initiatives to bear fruit. Half of them will be gone by then. Unless we can somehow change CEO and CFO tenures, tinkering with reporting frequency will do little. 3.0 Other mitigating factors 3.1 Compliance costs are coming down If the concern stems from compliance costs, things are only becoming easier. With AI and back-office automation, we can get to even more frequent reporting than a quarter, should we want to. 3.2 Markets lose a check in point for the company Quarterly reports validate or refute short term narratives that investors or traders have in a stock. Losing that avenue for checking on the progress or lack thereof of such a narrative will only increase return volatility. Return momentum on imprecise or simply wrong narratives will run for longer. As and when evidence against that narrative comes out, either via six monthly reports or from some other source, the crash in the stock price will be more vicious than otherwise. Frauds will take that much longer to discover when the firm can legally perpetuate radio silence. In sum, I worry that the debate confuses investment myopia with reporting frequency. Going to six monthly mandatory reporting is not a silver bullet. Instead, we must get to grips with the changing nature of capital markets, traders and managerial incentives.

Title: Ethereum Faces September Profit-Taking Risks Despite $638M ETF Boost

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) continues to capture institutional attention as strong inflows into spot ETFs highlight the growing demand. According to SoSoValue, Ethereum funds recorded $638 million in net inflows between September 8–12, 2025, with Fidelity’s FETH leading at $381 million. This marked the fourth consecutive week of gains and pushed cumulative Ethereum ETF inflows above $13.3 billion. While the inflows strengthen Ethereum’s long-term investment case, historical trends and on-chain signals suggest September profit-taking risks may resurface. Despite trading near $4,520 on September 15, ETH faces mixed market signals that could dictate its next major move. Ethereum ETFs are becoming a major part of the crypto market, with total assets under management surpassing $30 billion. Fidelity and BlackRock accounted for most of the latest inflows, while Grayscale and Bitwise also recorded steady gains. Institutional accumulation continues to reshape Ethereum’s market dynamics. Exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest levels since 2016, reflecting reduced selling pressure as more ETH flows into long-term holdings. Additionally, over 36 million ETH, about 30% of supply, is staked, further tightening liquidity. Despite the bullish inflows, history paints a cautious picture. September has typically been a weak month for ETH, with a median return of -12.7% since its launch. Current on-chain data supports this caution: the percentage of ETH supply in profit recently peaked near 99%, signaling overheated conditions. Past profit peaks have often led to 8–9% pullbacks. Furthermore, derivatives data shows Ethereum trading within a rising wedge pattern, a structure that often precedes corrections. Key support lies at $4,485 and $4,382, while resistance levels target $4,760 and $4,945. Ethereum’s fundamentals currently remain strong. ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and shrinking exchange supply provide structural support. If ETH holds above $4,700, cascading liquidations could propel a move toward the $4,900–$5,000 range. However, traders must remain cautious. With September’s track record of corrections and elevated profit-taking signals, Ethereum could face short-term volatility even as its long-term case strengthens. Ethereum’s next test will be whether it can sustain momentum beyond September, breaking the cycle of seasonal weakness while capitalizing on growing institutional demand.

On a Sept. 15 post via X, he shared a reform plan to filter airdrop farmers who dump tokens immediately after launches. Qureshi responded to Aztec CMO Claire Kart’s critique that airdrops “tank your chart” and provide “lazy alignment” by drawing parallels to IPO allocation methods. Companies offer institutional investors like BlackRock preferential pricing because these firms demonstrate long-term holding patterns, while retail investors pay market prices due to unpredictable behavior. Qureshi stated: “It’s crazy that token distributions don’t work this way.” He advocated for meta-incentives based on users’ historical token behavior rather than platform-specific metrics. The Dragonfly partner proposed standardized holder scores tracking token retention curves, governance participation, fee spending, liquidity provision, and product usage across multiple protocols. Projects would publish these scores in JSON format, enabling other teams to incorporate reputation data into distribution decisions. Qureshi argued that this creates accountability across the ecosystem. Users who know about future airdrops consider their holding history when modifying their behavior toward long-term commitment rather than immediate selling. Credit bureaus operate similarly, with financial institutions sharing customer data to encourage responsible behavior. The framework recommended limiting free airdrops to under 15% of total token generation events while selling the majority through score-tiered crowdsales. Better holder scores receive larger allocations at lower prices, while mercenary farmers pay full price or receive no access. Qureshi stated that the proposal addresses fundamental airdrop problems by requiring skin in the game. Users paying for tokens create committed holder bases versus recipients of free money seeking immediate exits. Crowdsales also provide built-in sybil resistance, as creating thousands of farming accounts becomes economically prohibitive. He acknowledged airdrops remain useful for pay-for-performance scenarios requiring specific measurable activities like total value locked or trading volume. However, Qureshi concluded that broad “helicopter money” distributions only attract artificial activity that disappears after token launches.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Davis Companies, a Boston-based real estate investment firm, announced Monday it has hired Alexander K. Zabik, a multi-decade CRE veteran, as its new managing director and head of credit investments, where he will lead the firm’s strategic credit platform. Zabik comes to Davis from Pennybacker Capital, where he served as principal and portfolio manager of credit since 2018. In a statement, Zabik cited Davis’ talented and deep roster, its vertically integrated investment structure, and track record of $13.5 billion worth of CRE investments as his reasons for making the jump, noting the company’s ability to execute “a differentiated middle-market credit strategy.” “I’m excited to join Davis at this pivotal moment of growth,” Zabik added. In addition to his work spearheading credit investment, Zabik will be tasked with guiding Davis’ high-yielding mortgage investment businesses, as well as advising on select preferred equity and mezzanine investments. His work will also concentrate on purchasing performing notes, single-asset debt securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. “Alex’s expertise in the credit markets and his proven ability to execute sophisticated investment strategies make him an ideal leader to drive our focused expansion into the credit business,” said Stephen Davis, president of Davis. “This move strengthens our platform and positions us to execute credit transactions through a value-driven, opportunistic approach which leverages the breadth of our firm’s in-house capabilities.” Zabik spent the early part of his 30-year career at BlackRock, where he helped grow the firm’s high-yield commercial real estate debt business over nine years. Then he joined WestRiver Capital, where he spent 16 years as a senior managing director of a $188 million private equity credit fund. Over the course of his three-decade career, he has overseen $5 billion in strategic CRE investments, according to a release from Davis. Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

15.09.2025, 20:57 Uhr A jump in the share price of the Google parent company Alphabet on Monday saw its value on the New York stock market rise above $3 trillion for the first time. Alphabet's A shares recently rose by around 4% to $252 on Wall Street. This made them one of the strongest performers in the Nasdaq 100 technology index. By breaking through the three-trillion-dollar mark, the A and C shares of Google's parent company crowned their rally since the beginning of April, when the A shares were only trading at around $145. The shares have gained almost 60% in the past year. This makes Alphabet the fourth most expensive company on the US stock market. Only tech giants Apple, Microsoft and â as the most valuable company â chipmaker NVIDIA, which is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom, have a higher market valuation. Analysts see room for further price gains at Alphabet. The trigger for the recent rise was the US bank Citigroup raising its price target for A shares from $225 to $280. Alphabet, along with Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Facebook's parent company Meta, Amazon and Tesla, is one of the "Magnificent Seven" companies listed on the US stock market. The tech giants set the pace for global stock markets and carry significant weight in index funds (ETFs) such as the MSCI World or the S&P 500, which are popular with private investors. powered by dpa-newslab | Legal Notice | About Us / Contact | Privacy

CoreWeave (CRWV) said Monday it has signed a $6.3 billion initial order with Nvidia (NVDA) with a condition that the AI chip star buys unsold capacity, sending shares in the cloud computing platform surging. As part of the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any unsold cloud-computing capacity through April 13, 2032, if CoreWeave’s data centers aren’t fully utilized by its own customers. CoreWeave made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said the deal was struck on Sept. 9. Nvidia has ties with CoreWeave on several fronts. Apart from being a customer, Nvidia sells its chips to CoreWeave and has a stake in the cloud platform. Apart from Nvidia, CoreWeave’s customers include Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META). Separately, on Monday, Deutsche Bank added CoreWeave to its Catalyst Call Buy Idea List, citing “a few positive factors" that will support revenue revisions upward over the next quarter or two. CoreWeave will benefit as “spending intentions being signaled by those in industry and the scale of some of the recent contract announcements make demand for AI infrastructure appear almost insatiable and at least for the near-to-medium-term, demand significantly outstrips supply," wrote analyst Brad Zelnick. CoreWeave shares are rising almost 7% in intraday trading Monday and have gained more than 200% since going public in March this year in one of 2025’s hottest IPOs.

Title: XRP’s Market Cap Beats Out Heavy Hitters In Climb Into 100 Top Global Assets — Here Are The Numbers

XRP has climbed back into the top 100 global assets by market cap, surpassing some notable names, following its reclaim of the psychological $3 level. This comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which has sparked hopes of a continuation of the bull run. Companies Market Cap data shows that XRP’s market cap is larger than that of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and also Sony. The altcoin’s market cap is currently at around $182 billion, while BlackRock and Sony boast a market cap of $173 and $174 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, based on its market cap, XRP currently sits as the 88th largest asset, just behind Xiaomi. It is worth noting that the altcoin has briefly surpassed banking giant Citigroup, Verizon, and Shopify following a rally of over 3% over the weekend. However, XRP has pared some of these gains and now looks to be consolidating in preparation for the next leg to the upside. XRP’s rally comes amid a broad crypto market rally, with other major altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, BNB, and Solana recording significant gains. Some fundamentals could serve as a catalyst for higher XRP prices, as its market cap looks to surpass more companies on the global assets ranking. This includes the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF that is set to take place this week. This will be the first U.S. XRP fund to provide institutional investors with spot exposure to the altcoin. This is expected to inject new liquidity into the XRP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to make a rate cut at this week’s FOMC meeting. This is typically bullish for altcoins for XRP, although there is also the possibility that it may be a ‘sell the news’ event. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that the XRP price could rally to $3.6 following its breakout above $3.05. He had earlier stated that there were two possible scenarios. One possibility is that it could break above $3.05 and then rally to $3.60, or it could dip to $2.80, break above $2.90, and then rally to $3.60. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as the major support levels to watch out for as the XRP price prepares for another leg to the upside. The analyst stated that the targets are the $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels. A rally to these price levels would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin.

Title: Astranis and Impulse Space Sign Agreement for 2027 Mission, Direct-Inject to GEO

September 15, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: Impulse Space Impulse Space REDONDO BEACH, Calif. and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Impulse Space, the leader for in-space mobility, and Astranis, manufacturer of advanced high-orbit satellites, signed a contract today for an upcoming mission to GEO. Targeting a 2027 launch, the mission will utilize a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch to low Earth orbit (LEO), where it will deploy Impulse’s Helios kick stage. Leveraging chemical propulsion via its powerful Deneb engine, Helios will then deliver Astranis MicroGEO satellites from LEO to GEO in less than 24 hours, deploying them to their target orbital regime in geostationary orbit. This mission will showcase the capabilities of Astranis and Impulse to rapidly deploy satellites to geostationary orbit without the use of a Heavy-class rocket, a mission profile appealing to government and commercial customers alike. Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure, enterprise-grade communications from GEO for customers around the world. Geostationary orbit allows a single satellite to provide 24/7 operational service, but reaching that orbit requires traversing the radiation-laden Van Allen Belts that surround the planet. Traditionally, Astranis satellites have used efficient but low thrust electric propulsion thrusters to make the orbit raise maneuver, which can take months. By using Helios to rapidly transit between orbits, Astranis will avoid the cost and risk of a slower transit, instead arriving at the target destination in a matter of hours after launch. “We selected Impulse’s Helios vehicle for this mission because it offers a faster, more reliable, and more cost-effective way for us to get our satellites operational and delivering service to customers,” said John Gedmark, co-founder and CEO of Astranis. “Demonstrating new methods of rapidly deploying satellites to geostationary orbit is important for both our government and commercial customers, and Impulse is the perfect partner for us in this effort.” “This is exactly the type of mission that Helios is designed for,” said Eric Romo, President and COO of Impulse Space. “By providing rapid transport to higher energy orbits, we help operators like Astranis to begin delivering on their mission promise sooner. And with our vertically-integrated approach to design, manufacturing, and testing, we offer reliability and schedule assurance to further de-risk the mission profile.” Astranis will be flying as the primary payload on the mission, with the potential for secondary payloads to be added later. About Impulse SpaceImpulse Space, the in-space mobility leader, is accelerating our future beyond Earth beginning with its fleet of cost-effective, high-performance space vehicles: Helios and Mira. The Helios kick stage unlocks high-energy orbits with its powerful Deneb engine, rapidly transporting payloads from LEO to MEO, GEO, heliocentric, lunar, and other planetary orbits. The flight-proven Mira enables precise maneuverability and rapid responsiveness for hosting, deployment, and rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) across any orbit. Founded by Tom Mueller and led by a team of industry pioneers, Impulse Space is transforming in-space mobility by reliably and rapidly getting customers where they want to go. And they're just getting started.

Today Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure networks to highly-sophisticated customers across the globe—large enterprises, sovereign governments, and the US military. With five satellites on orbit and many more set to launch soon, the company is servicing a backlog of more than $1 billion of commercial contracts. Astranis is the preferred satellite communications partner for buyers with stringent requirements for uptime, data security, network visibility, and customization.

U.S. equities were higher at midday on positive comments about China trade and the future of TikTok from President Trump, as well as Tesla (TSLA) news. S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Tesla shares jumped as a regulatory filing showed CEO Elon Musk purchased 2.57 million shares of the electric vehicle's stock valued at about $1 billion. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) traded above $200 for the first time on continued excitement over the company's new hard disk drive for artificial intelligence data centers. Intel (INTC) shares climbed after the struggling semiconductor maker reduced its target for full-year non-GAAP operating expenses after completing the $3.3 billion sale of a majority stake in its Altera programmable chip business to private equity firm Silver Lake. Alphabet (GOOGL) shares were up for a third straight session, making the parent of Google the fourth company with a $3 trillion market capitalization. Corteva (CTVA) was among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 following a report that the manufacturer of crop seeds and pesticides is looking into splitting itself into two separate companies. Some chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), fell as Chinese regulators were investigating potential dumping of analog integrated circuit semiconductors from the U.S. U.S.-listed shares of AstraZeneca (AZN) declined after a report the drugmaker had paused a planned $272 million investment in Britain, and received a downgrade from Europe's Handelsbanken. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies dipped.

Title: Flexport Projects 2025 Profit from Convoy Sale, Eyes More Market Share by 2026
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/flexport-projects-2025-profit-convoy-organic-growth-freight-forwarder-ryan-petersen-1234777450/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T15:30:00Z

By Glenn Taylor Flexport anticipates it will be in profitable in 2025 thanks to the freight tech company’s sale of the Convoy freight-matching platform. The digital freight forwarder targeted profitability by the end of this year, with CEO Ryan Petersen telling the Wall Street Journal that the Convoy sale was a “one-time event” that “was more than our burn rate for this year.” Flexport sold the once-defunct freight booking platform to DAT Freight & Analytics for $250 million, flipping it nearly two years after acquiring the technology stack out of insolvency for roughly $16 million. Without the Convoy sale, Flexport would not be able to reach its 2025 profitability goal, Petersen said. The founder said the company is now on track for a profitable 2026 driven by organic growth as it expands into new countries, cuts costs and seeks to take more market share from larger competitors in the freight forwarding industry like DHL, C.H. Robinson, Kuehne+Nagel and DSV. According to the WSJ article, Flexport opened an office in Indonesia earlier this month and plans to launch in six additional countries in 2026. The company’s growth is contingent on an industry that has been hit heavily by decreased demand and slower shipping volume growth in recent years, ultimately resulting in lower freight rates. Package delivery titans like UPS and FedEx have been hit hard by the demand shifts, with both implementing mass cost-cutting efforts to save billions of dollars and improve efficiency. Related Stories Topics CBP Certifies 12 Companies to Collect International Duties After De Minimis Ban Topics Trucking Bankruptcies Pile Up on Soft Demand Flexport is one of many logistics businesses that has had to maneuver the on-and-off tariff whiplash of 2025. Customers had to suspend or stop freight bookings altogether when the U.S. tacked “reciprocal” duties on imports from trade partners worldwide in April, before rushing orders into the country again after the tariffs were given a three-month delay. The back-and-forth resulted in a brief (and early) peak shipping season that saw year-over-year cargo growth at U.S. ports in July, before inbound volumes began their downturn starting in August. Air freight at Flexport took a hit as well, not just from the tariffs, but from the closure of the duty-free de minimis provision. The Trump administration banned the trade exemption for low-value shipments out of China at the start May, before putting a stop to the provision for any foreign goods headed to the U.S. in late August. As volumes on the Asia-to-U.S. trade lane suffered, Flexport moved less air cargo for its clients. “Air freight prices are quite low because of the end of de minimis shipping,” Petersen told CNBC in a Friday interview. “That was a huge percentage of the world’s air freight that’s more or less gone away.” According to Petersen, Flexport’s warehousing and customs brokerage businesses have benefitted from the U.S. trade policy shifts. Flexport’s gross profit on its customs brokerage and compliance business is up 99 percent year over year in 2025. From a financial perspective, Flexport had still been losing money prior to the Convoy deal. Shopify’s earnings results in August indicate that the e-commerce company incurred a net loss of $24 million on its Flexport investment in the second quarter. Those results are reported on a one-quarter delay, meaning the loss came in Flexport’s April-to-June quarter. Combined with the quarter prior, Shopify lost $47 million over the latest six months reported by Flexport. In total, Shopify’s investment in Flexport is $595 million as of June 30, down from $642 million six months prior. Given that the tech titan has a 17 percent stake in Flexport as of Sept. 30, 2023, Flexport’s estimated valuation stands at $3.5 billion, still a far cry from its peak of $8 billion in February 2022 when the company hauled in a $935 million Series E funding round. As the company hopes to improve its fortunes in 2026, is expanding its supply chain financing business by partnering with asset management firm BlackRock. With the team up, Flexport is expanding financing options for companies facing higher tariff costs and other trade-related strains on cash flow. BlackRock-managed funds and accounts will provide $250 million to Flexport within the partnership, nearly doubling Flexport’s current lending capacity, the companies say. The freight tech firm’s financial services arm, Flexport Capital, has provided more than $2 billion since it started in 2017. The BlackRock partnership will last four years, and allows financing across various points of companies’ supply chains through purchase orders, inventory pickup, freight movement, warehousing and final delivery.

Manage your account ... The 2025-26 NBA season is almost here, and with it comes my position-by-position fantasy basketball tiers, starting with the guards. This guide is points-league focused but includes insights for category formats as well. [Join or create a fantasy basketball league for the 2025-26 NBA season] Let's kick it off with two players who will drive much of the MVP conversation this season. Editor's note: Players are listed based on their primary position from last season or projected role this year. Luka Dončić, Los Angeles Lakers Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder Luka Dončić: Luka enters his first full Lakers season healthy and in shape, ready to deliver close to a nightly 30-point triple-double. Even in a down year, he dropped 28-8-8. His blend of usage, shot volume and all-around production makes him one of the safest fantasy picks available. With efficiency improvements and better conditioning, he could push for a top-three finish across formats. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: SGA and Luka were the only guards to average over 50 FPPG last season. After a legendary season finishing as the scoring leader, MVP, Finals MVP and champion, SGA's floor is top five across all formats. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Cade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers James Harden, Los Angeles Clippers Anthony Edwards: Edwards continues his ascent as Minnesota’s offensive centerpiece, combining highlight-reel finishes with steady statistical growth. His scoring is already elite, but his rebounds and assists have begun to rise, too. With another leap in efficiency, Edwards could join Tier 1 next season. Cade Cunningham: There's a chance Cunningham can sneak into the elites. He averaged 48 FPPG last season, so another leap forward for him and the Pistons in a weaker Eastern Conference can push him into 50 FPPG territory. Devin Booker: The only thing preventing Booker from being a savage offensively is a possible late-season tank. I don't see it happening, so expect Booker to put up top-tier points and assist numbers. Trae Young: Trae’s elite assists and scoring floor make him one of the best points-league guards. Turnovers and poor shooting don’t impact his value as much, so bank on him being one of the few players getting at least 24 points and 10 assists a night. Tyrese Maxey: I'm higher on Maxey than the consensus. Maxey posted the sixth-most FPPG among guards last year. Those numbers are going up with Joel Embiid and Paul George undoubtedly missing games. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors De’Aaron Fox, San Antonio Spurs Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers Stephen Curry: I'd draft Curry higher in category leagues than points because his 3s and high FT% are more statistically relevant. Still, he'll likely be a top-10 scorer in the NBA who also generates enough counting stats elsewhere to warrant an early pick in points leagues. De’Aaron Fox: Fox gets a full offseason to prepare to play with Victor Wembanyama, so an uptick in assists as the primary creator elevates his value. He finished in the top 10 in FPPG among guards last season, averaging 41 FPPG. Jalen Brunson: The engine for the Knicks has one of the safest floors for a guard. He'll likely go in the first three rounds of drafts, but be aware that the minutes are likely to dip under new HC Mike Brown. LaMelo Ball: Injuries always hold him back, and it's reflected in his ADP. When healthy, though, Ball is capable of being a top-10 scorer amongst guards in FPPG. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Josh Giddey, Chicago Bulls Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets Desmond Bane, Orlando Magic Derrick White, Boston Celtics Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets Ja Morant: Few guards are as explosive as Morant, capable of putting up 25/7/5 lines on any given night. The risk is obvious — injuries and off-court issues — but the reward is massive if he plays 65+ games. He’s a swing pick with league-winning upside. He's way better for points formats since you can ignore the poor FT shooting, turnovers and lack of 3s. Josh Giddey: He inked a new contract, plus was one of three players to average at least 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game last year. The other two? Luka and Nikola Jokić. Giddey can push for over 40 FPPG this year. Amen Thompson: With Jalen Green gone, Thompson steps into a bigger role in Houston’s offense. His rebounding and defensive stocks make him an unusual fantasy guard with multi-category upside. If his jumper stabilizes, it'll more than justify a third-round selection, even for points leagues. Desmond Bane: Bane is a solid 30-35 FPPG scorer, but he'll be in a new environment, playing alongside Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. I prefer Bane in category leagues, but he'll have the counting stats to warrant a pick around the fourth or fifth round. Jalen Green, Phoenix Suns Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers Austin Reaves, Los Angeles Lakers Jordan Poole, New Orleans Pelicans Zach LaVine, Sacramento Kings Dyson Daniels, Atlanta Hawks Coby White, Chicago Bulls Fred VanVleet, Houston Rockets Anfernee Simons, Boston Celtics Jalen Green: Green gets a huge bump after getting traded to the Suns. Volume is king for points leagues and he'll get plenty of opportunities as the secondary option to Booker. He's much better for points than category leagues. Cam Thomas: Thomas still hasn't signed his qualifying offer with the Nets. We'll have to wait and see how long his contract situation plays out. Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. are going to have a ton of scoring opportunities playing for Brooklyn. Darius Garland: Garland should be a tier higher, but he underwent surgery on his toe in June with a recovery timeline of 4-5 months. I don't expect to see him in uniform until November. When fully healthy, he should average north of 35 FPPG. Dyson Daniels: The NBA's Most Improved Player took a massive step forward last season. However, Jalen Johnson was hurt for the majority of the season, and the team wasn't as equipped as it is now. I'm expecting some regression despite Daniels averaging 37 FPPG in 2024-25. Fred VanVleet: FVV loses value in points leagues because his 3s, steals and FT% don't carry as much weight. Still, he's a useful PG capable of putting up at least 30 FPPG. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto Raptors Andrew Nembhard, Indiana Pacers Jalen Suggs, Orlando Mag Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics CJ McCollum, Washington Wizards Bennedict Mathurin, Indiana Pacers Norman Powell, Miami Heat Bradley Beal, Los Angeles Clippers Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers Christian Braun, Denver Nuggets Immanuel Quickley: Quickley is looking to bounce back from an injury-riddled campaign. He averaged 31 FPPG when he played, so it's something to build off of playing with Scottie Barnes, Brandon Ingram and Jakob Poeltl. Andrew Nembhard: Nembhard is one of my favorite breakout candidates with Tyrese Haliburton being ruled out for the season. His skill set fits better with category leagues, but I'd also consider getting shares in points leagues. CJ McCollum: McCollum's ADP is just outside the top 100 over the past seven days on Yahoo. He's becoming a value, especially for points leagues. I think he'll play a lot of minutes for the Wizards until a mid-season trade likely sends him to a contender. Shaedon Sharpe: Sharpe’s athleticism pops every night, and he’s starting to find consistency as a scorer. Portland is giving him freedom to develop, which means more usage. He's on the verge of becoming a 20-point scorer in this League. Kevin Porter Jr., Milwaukee Bucks Keyonte George, Utah Jazz D’Angelo Russell, Dallas Mavericks Jaden Ivey, Detroit Pistons Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors Ayo Dosunmu, Chicago Bulls Davion Mitchell, Miami Heat Isaiah Collier, Utah Jazz Quentin Grimes, Philadelphia 76ers Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings Keyonte George: George had growing pains last year, but his court vision and scoring style — reminiscent of Jordan Clarkson — make him worth the gamble. If his efficiency stabilizes, he could jump to Tier 6 quickly. Brandin Podziemski: Podziemski is one of the rare guards who rebounds like a forward. Golden State trusts him with meaningful minutes, which ensures a solid floor. If Curry misses time, his value skyrockets. Stephon Castle: Castle will start at SG and offers some nice counting-stat potential heading into his second NBA season. He's a better asset for points leagues because his efficiency and lack of 3s remain an issue. Davion Mitchell: Once he was traded to the Heat last year, he was finally able to carve out a meaningful role. His defense is infectious and he looked far more comfortable shooting the ball and acting as a primary facilitator than he did with the Kings and Raptors. He's one of my sleepers whom I'll be selecting in the later rounds of drafts. Scoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers Cason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder Jared McCain, Philadelphia 76ers Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Atlanta Hawks Reed Sheppard, Houston Rockets Tre Johnson, Washington Wizards Anthony Black, Orlando Magic VJ Edgecombe, Philadelphia 76ers Rob Dillingham, Minnesota Timberwolves Bub Carrington, Washington Wizards Scoot Henderson: Henderson’s early career journey has been volatile. Bringing in Jrue Holiday likely puts him back on the bench. Perhaps a sixth-man role could pan out. Either way, he's better for points leagues than category if he continues getting 27 minutes a night. Cason Wallace: Wallace thrives as a low-mistake, high-efficiency rotation guard. OKC trusts him in high-leverage minutes, which locks in his role. I think we'll see his role expand this season, making him a fantasy asset in more category leagues than points leagues. Tre Johnson: Outside of Cooper Flagg, Johnson has a legitimate shot at Rookie of the Year. The injury to Bilal Coulibaly should expedite his fantasy impact as well. Rob Dillingham: The second-year guard looked great at Summer League. Mike Conley is getting older and Nickeil Alexander-Walker left in free agency, so they'll need Dillingham's speed and scoring punch off the bench. He's a bucket who will emerge as a points league guy this year. Russell Westbrook III, Free agent Donte DiVincenzo, Minnesota Timberwolves T.J. McConnell, Indiana Pacers Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers Jrue Holiday, Portland Trail Blazers Klay Thompson, Dallas Mavericks Collin Sexton, Charlotte Hornets Alex Caruso, Oklahoma City Thunder Caris LeVert, Detroit Pistons

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft's stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has climbed over 30% in the past six months, driven by strong quarterly results marked by improving revenue growth and expanding margins. However, with the stock now trading at 37 times its trailing earnings, the key question for investors is whether MSFT is still worth buying. We believe MSFT stock currently looks expensive due to its elevated valuation. Our view is based on a detailed analysis comparing the stock’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and its overall financial position, both current and historical. While Microsoft shows strong operational and financial performance, these strengths already seem priced into its lofty valuation, as outlined below. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with lower volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?

While Azure’s growth could convince some investors that an even higher multiple is justified, we think from a risk standpoint it’s better to wait for a price pullback before buying MSFT. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a consistent track record of outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with lower risk versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The consulting industry is on track to get upended, and we'll all have to deal with the consequences

Welcome back! The older you get, the tougher it can be to bounce back from the weekend. But if Sam Altman's startup gets its way, aging doesn't necessarily mean decline. BI's Hilary Brueck looked at how Retro Biosciences is developing a pill to clear out the "gunk" in your brain. In today's big story, the consulting industry is on the cusp of a big overhaul, and the rest of the business world is likely to feel it. What's on deck: Markets: Forget equity, this hedge fund just wants a cut of revenue from the tech companies it backs. Tech: It's tech news, but treat it like a spectator sport. Why people love "TBPN." Business: A Real Housewives star and former Netflix exec walks us through her daily routine. But first, the synergies are no longer synergizing. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A key pipeline for funneling talent into white-collar work has sprung a big leak that won't be easy to fix. A combination of AI, shifting customer demands, and tougher paths to promotions means the consulting industry is on the cusp of being completely reshaped, writes Business Insider's Jennifer Sor. Consultants are no strangers to volatility. In fact, a big part of their business is advising clients on the best ways to navigate change. But the current trends giving consultants plenty of work — operating more slimmed-down workforces and leveraging AI — are also impacting their own ranks. Analysts told Jennifer that the end result isn't clear, but early signs point to a tightening of senior and junior roles in the industry. BI's Polly Thompson, our resident consulting expert, has extensively reported on these trends. PwC, for example, plans to cut college graduate hiring over the next three years, with AI cited as a primary reason. That's also trickling upward as senior employees head for the exits, with several unhappy about dwindling pay and a shrinking window to reach the profession's pinnacle: partner. The rest of the business world will likely feel the effects of an upheaval within consulting. Love them or hate them, consultants are undeniably a part of the fabric of corporate America. One direct impact is the work they do with clients across the globe. Got a big business decision to make? Chances are you're going to bring in a consultant for some advice. As those firms reshape themselves, the way companies interact with, or even pay for, consultants could change. But it goes beyond that. Consulting often represents young people's foot in the white-collar workforce door. Work on a project for a few years for a client and then eventually go in-house. As the number of junior consultants dwindles, that could disrupt how countless companies stock their ranks. Those converts can also go on to do big things. Sheryl Sandberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jamie Dimon are just a few examples of high-profile consulting alums. But if anyone is well-suited to navigate a quickly moving landscape, it's consultants. After all, that's what the rest of us all pay them so much for. And if all else fails, they could always hire … a consultant. Commercial real estate is going Hollywood. You've heard of "Selling Sunset." Now get ready for "The Real Estate Commission," A&E's upcoming show about the epic highs and lows of being a commercial real estate dealmaker. Its star, Todd Drowlette, gave BI a behind-the-scenes look at the first season. A new fund wants to give tech companies the royal(ty) treatment. Althera42 wants to invest in Europe's digital infrastructure, like data centers and cloud computing, with a slight twist. Instead of getting equity, Althera42 provides capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues. The idea is to bring the investing playbook behind music royalties to tech. Beware of the gigantic price bubble. David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and a stock-market bear, warns of negative S&P 500 returns due to high valuations. The Shiller CAPE is at its third-highest level of all time. That's not the only reason Rosenberg is skeptical. Want to become fluent in tech bro? Watch "TBPN." For three hours, five days a week, hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the online show Technology Business Programming discuss tech industry drama like a spectator sport and chat with investors, founders, and sometimes journalists. BI's Julia Hornstein tuned in for a week to understand why it's become a must-watch for the chronically online tech crowd. Polymarket is about to cash in on a US expansion. The betting site, known for predicting Trump's presidential win in 2024, is raising another funding round that would sharply increase its valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Investor demand has risen as Polymarket appears ready to launch in the US. Big cuts at Musk's xAI. Elon Musk's AI startup laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team. xAI is now prioritzing specialist AI tutors over generalists, according to multiple messages viewed by BI's Grace Kay. How Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Bozoma Saint John does it all. At 5:30 am every morning, the former Netflix CMO is already meditating and praying. For BI's Power Hour series, Saint John shared her daily routine, from running a hair-care company and hosting a new Jimmy Fallon show to being a single mom. The world's richest men are buying huge media companies because they can. In 2022, Elon Musk bought what we used to call Twitter. That's what Larry Ellison is considering today by financing his son David's plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery weeks after buying Paramount. It's unlikely anyone will stand in the way, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Breaking up is hard to do. Especially when you're trying to break up with your employer of many years. The job market is tough enough already, but those who haven't had to job search in decades face age-related biases and other unique challenges. O, Canada: Americans, and their businesses, miss their neighbors up north. The latest challenge for Uber drivers: GPS.

Title: Can Natera Stock Reach $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-natera-stock-reach-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T14:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Let's start with something remarkable. Natera (NASDAQ: NTRA) just marked its 10th anniversary as a public company, and what a journey it has been. The stock has delivered nearly 10x returns, rising from its $18 IPO price to around $170 today. Even more impressive, revenues have also expanded about 10-fold from $190 million to $2 billion. And the momentum hasn’t slowed — revenue growth over the last twelve months was a stellar 44%. So, what’s fueling this growth? It comes down to one word: intelligence — specifically, medical intelligence. Natera has placed itself at the forefront of molecular diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and monitoring. Think of them as medical detectives, helping doctors detect issues at the genomic level before they become life-threatening emergencies. Their flagship product, Signatera, is a game-changer. This personalized tumor-informed test uses a simple blood draw to detect circulating tumor DNA and monitor for molecular residual disease across multiple cancer types, including breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. This isn’t just an incremental improvement — it’s a revolutionary technology transforming how oncologists monitor their patients. But what makes their technology stand out? Its beauty lies in its simplicity and precision. Rather than invasive procedures, patients undergo a simple blood draw — a liquid biopsy. But this isn’t an ordinary blood test. Natera’s platform can detect tiny fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, offering doctors unprecedented insight into cancer progression and recurrence risk. Beyond Signatera, Natera also offers Altera for genomic profiling and Empower for hereditary cancer screening — creating a comprehensive suite that covers the entire cancer care spectrum. Before we dive into Natera stock’s specific metrics, it’s worth noting an important reality: investing in high-growth companies like Natera comes with volatility. While the upside can be significant, the ride is often bumpy. If you want high-quality growth with lower volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark — a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes — with returns exceeding 91% since inception. This diversified approach provides exposure to high-quality growth names while managing single-stock risk. On a separate note, see – What’s Happening With ABBV Stock? Now, let’s explore why Natera’s story is so compelling. Here’s where things get exciting. In the latest quarter, Natera processed over 850,000 tests, generating $546.6 million in revenue. About 22% of these tests were oncology-related, and this segment is growing at 50% year-over-year. This is the key engine driving future growth. Let’s zoom out. Cancer recurrence is every survivor’s worst fear, yet traditional monitoring often leaves patients waiting months for clarity. Nearly 19 million U.S. cancer survivors live in constant uncertainty between scans. They need better tools to track their cancer status, representing a massive market that will require sophisticated monitoring for decades to come. Now, we believe Natera can sustain 25% annual revenue growth over the next few years. That would boost revenue from about $1.7 billion last year to around $7 billion in 2030 — a 4x increase. For context, they’ve grown revenue at an average of 40% over the past three years, so 25% is actually not that aggressive. You might ask — is there room for a company this size to keep growing? Absolutely. The cell-free DNA testing market — which includes what Signatera does — is expected to almost double from $11 billion today to around $20 billion within five years. [1] Natera isn’t just riding this wave — they’re helping shape it. Consider the competition: Roche leads diagnostics with $16+ billion in revenue, followed by Danaher at $10 billion and Abbott at $9 billion. Natera’s $2 billion shows they’re still in the early innings of their growth story. The growth path breaks down into several key areas: How could $7 billion in revenue translate to a $500+ stock price? The math is compelling. If Natera hits $7 billion while maintaining its current price-to-sales multiple of 13x, the stock could reach about $700. Even with multiple compressions to 10x, that’s still well above $500. This assumes minimal dilution, which is reasonable given its cash-generation potential at scale. Yes, the company is currently loss-making, but as revenue grows, margins should turn positive. Natera’s net income margin has improved from -75% in 2021 to -13% now. Diagnostic market penetration takes time. For Natera to be valued at $50B, $100B, or even $200B (vs. $23B today), investors must think long-term — 2030 and beyond — with billions of tests processed annually worldwide. By 2035, liquid biopsies could be as routine as cholesterol tests. Still, several factors must align: Despite the opportunity, key risks remain: Natera is a genuine growth story driven by breakthrough technology addressing massive markets. It has scaled impressively while sustaining momentum that most CEOs would envy. The path to $500+ per share is mathematically feasible — but execution must be flawless. For risk-tolerant investors, this offers high growth with meaningful upside — balanced by real execution and market risks. For a more diversified approach, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its benchmark of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Its quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap names has delivered strong returns while cushioning losses in down markets (RV Portfolio metrics). The opportunity is real — the question is whether Natera can execute and whether investors can stomach the volatility for what could be a rewarding ride. 1.

Title: Investa rolls out zero-commission options trading app

Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:52:02Z

Investa, the UK’s first zero-commission options trading app, is now available to investors after an active soft launch where over 1400 trades were facilitated — putting what they believe is an under-utilised investment product in reach of on-the-go traders and more sophisticated investors. 1 15 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The app, available on iOS, has been built by a team of former Citi options brokers and the co-founder of Freetrade, Ian Fuller. It was created to address the access gap in options trading for UK investors. It will be launched on Android in the months ahead. An option is a contract between two parties that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price on or before a specified date. In exchange for this right, the buyer pays a premium. There are two main types of listed, tradeable options: Call option: Gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy an asset at a set price on or before a specified date.Put option: Gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell an asset at a set price on or before a specified date.Under 2% of UK retail investors have traded an option, compared with nearly 20% in the US, a gap Investa believes is driven by high costs, complex platforms and limited access. Addressing these challenges, the Investa app offers a streamlined experience designed around education, clarity, accessibility and transparency. Early feedback from the soft launch has been built into the app’s final features and interface. Key app features include: Zero commission (other fees apply) Access to over 200 stocks and ETFs with over 100,000 options contracts to trade No margin, cash accounts onlyClear, jargon-free terminology Intuitively designed options cards that strip back complexity During the soft launch, trading favourites included Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Nike (NKE), with Nvidia alone representing over 20% of options activity. Alec Beasley, Co–founder and CEO of Investa, commented: “Our goal is to make the options market more accessible to savvy UK investors, as we believe it offers huge untapped opportunities. There is not a lack of interest in options trading, but rather a lack of access. High fees, confusing platforms and limited availability have kept UK investors out and we are directly addressing that gap. “The feedback from our soft launch was invaluable and has directly influenced the features and interface that are live today. We’re also enabling investors to join us on our journey through our second Crowdcube round as we strongly believe in community ownership. “Options trading has traditionally been an exclusive market, and we want to change that not only through the product but also through how we fund the company. Crowdfunding allows our early adopters to become shareholders and grow with us.” Marios Syrimis, Investa Investor and User, added: “I had tried options trading on other platforms, but it was difficult to get set up and their hidden fees were frustrating. I’ve traded on Investa several times now and have found the execution incredibly smooth. The user interface makes the options experience intuitive, which made it easy for me to get started. As both an investor and a customer, it’s refreshing to finally find a platform that really cares about making options accessible to UK investors.” The public launch of the app coincides with Investa’s second fundraising campaign on Crowdcube, following its record-breaking 2024 round that attracted just shy of 500 investors — the most participated-in UK fintech raise on Crowdcube that year. In its second Crowdcube raise, Investa is on a mission to target at least £1m, which will be used to develop and launch an Android app, scale its marketing operations, expand its product features, and grow the customer base following the public launch of the

Other issuers, including Ark Invest and Bitwise, also posted gains, though smaller. Daily flows showed steady demand. Monday started with $364 million, followed by a muted $23 million on Tuesday. The pace accelerated to $742 million on Wednesday, $553 million on Thursday, and $642 million on Friday. Last week’s inflows “signal clear demand impulse, the one that looks both meaningful and timely,” Georgii Verbitskii, a derivatives trader and founder of decentralized protocol TYMIO, told Decrypt. With September to October marking “the start of the business season,” Verbitskii notes that the this “often sets the tone for trends that play out through the end of the year.” The base case, he added, is that this could be “the beginning of a new uptrend, with strong potential for further growth into Q4.” Still, while the inflows show a marked return to mid-July levels, “the number itself isn’t transformative on its own,” Wesley Crook, CEO of blockchain engineering firm FP Block, told Decrypt. “Much of this activity is being driven by expectations of rate cuts alongside the broader trend of enterprises entering the market,” Crook said, adding that he expects the momentum to likely continue as institutional allocations for Bitcoin bring “upward pressure on prices.” The surge aligned with growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next meeting set this week, with users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN, placing an 88% chance on a 25bps rate cut. During the same period, Bitcoin's price recovered above $115,000, reinforcing investor optimism. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at around $114,600, per CoinGecko data. “Structural demand is the real story here,” Farbod Sadeghian, founder of Dubai-headquartered international virtual asset chamber TheBlock., told Decrypt. While rate cut expectations could provide “a friendlier backdrop for risk assets,” such a setting is temporary, Sadeghian said. “The bigger factor is that investors, especially at the institutional level, now see Bitcoin as an allocation worth holding over the long term,” he said, adding that “the ETF wrapper makes it easier and safer to access, but the underlying appetite is clearly about exposure to the asset itself.” On the broader end, Sadeghian notes that Bitcoin ETF inflows, while “never perfectly smooth,” could expect to “stabilize and scale further” over macro-driven momentum as institutional investors steadily “integrate Bitcoin ETFs into standard portfolios.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: CoreWeave Stock Climbs 5% After $6.3B Cloud Capacity Deal with Nvidia
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/15/coreweave-stock-climbs-7-after-usd6-3b-cloud-capacity-deal-with-nvidia
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:45:14Z

CoreWeave (CRWV) were higher by about 5% in early U.S. trading Monday after the cloud computing company entered into a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to guarantee use of its excess server capacity, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the agreement, Nvidia will buy any unused computing resources from CoreWeave through April 2032. The arrangement ensures that CoreWeave’s vast fleet of data centers will not sit idle if customer demand fluctuates. If CoreWeave’s clients don’t fully book its servers, Nvidia is obligated to step in and purchase the residual capacity. Either company can exit the deal if one breaches terms or faces bankruptcy. For CoreWeave, the agreement locks in a long-term buyer for its spare capacity, reducing revenue risk as it builds out infrastructure. For Nvidia, it secures reliable access to cloud-based GPU resources at a time when demand for artificial intelligence training far exceeds supply. The agreement also strengthens ties between the two firms, as Nvidia not only supplies CoreWeave with GPUs but also holds an equity stake. Nvidia has already made CoreWeave one of its biggest bets. At the end of the second quarter, the AI chipmaker owned 24.3 million shares of CoreWeave worth about $3.96 billion. CoreWeave, founded in 2017, rents out access to Nvidia graphics processing units that power AI model training. The firm went public in March in what was the largest U.S. venture-backed tech IPO since 2021. Leading up to its debut, it raised billions in debt and equity financing, including from Nvidia itself. The stock surged roughly five-fold shortly following its April IPO, but subsequently lost about 50% during the summer. They've rebounded by about 35% since Labor Day.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Price To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/solana-price-prediction-sol-price-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:30:57Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Solana has been on a remarkable run lately. The price of SOL has surged by about 80% over the past six months and is now trading well above all its key moving averages. This impressive performance is supported by strong momentum, including its total value locked (TVL) reaching a record $13.22 billion and a surge of institutional investment. But the big question is—what would it take for SOL to double from here and surpass the $500 mark? Let’s explore what could drive that move. That said, if you are looking for upside potential with less volatility than holding an individual stock or token, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Explosive rallies like this may seem extreme, but they are not uncommon in the crypto space. Here are some recent examples: With these catalysts lining up, could Solana be on the brink of its next big move? We’ve discussed the upside, but what about the risks? No investment is without challenges, and Solana is no exception. Here’s what could hold it back: While the outlook seems positive, such rapid growth is never guaranteed. The crypto market is highly volatile, and success depends on Solana’s continued execution and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The RV Portfolio’s quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks enables it to capture market gains while limiting downside in weaker conditions, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. So, can Solana really hit $500? The fundamentals are compelling. With record TVL on the network and major investors piling in, the stage is set. Catalysts like a potential ETF approval and Solana’s booming ecosystem could drive a massive rally. Still, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

Title: Executives Remain Skittish About Buying Their Own Shares
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/15/executives-remain-skittish-about-buying-their-own-shares/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:15:00Z
Full Content:
ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Lately, insider buys by companies’ chief executives have been scarce. Executives normally sell more shares than they buy because their cup is periodically refilled with stock-option grants. Over the past 21 years, dollar volume for buys has usually run about 34% of the volume for sales, according to Gurufocus.com. Buying has been below normal in 13 of the past 15 months. In August, buys were only 26% of sales. The highest ratio of buys to sells, 2.01, was in October 2008, when much of the country was in despair as the Great Recession rolled on. The executives who bought 17 years ago looked smart when the economy recovered in 2009. Let’s look at a few companies where insiders bought last month. Remember Eastman Kodak? You used to buy its film for your camera, if you’re old enough. Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN) was spun off from Eastman Kodak in 1994. Coating, adhesives, and specialty plastics are among its products. The chief executive officer, Mark Costa, and the chief financial officer, McLain William Thomas Jr., made sizable purchases on Aug. 27. Costa bought about $502,000 of shares, Thomas about $252,000. Several other Eastman executives bought shares the same day. The stock has fallen 24% this year, partly because Eastman is hurt by tariffs more than most companies are. It imports materials from several European countries and from Brazil and India, which are being hit with particularly high tariffs. Yet the company has shown a profit for at least 30 years in a row. The stock now sells for about nine times earnings and less than one times revenue – far below its typical multiples. I think it will recover. In August, eight Eli Lilly (LLY) executives bought Lilly shares, and two sold. Buyers included the chief executive, David Ricks, who spent just over $1 million, and the chief financial officer, Lucas Montarce, who shelled out almost $495,000. The pharmaceutical company’s shares traded as high as $942 last summer, but have come down to about $755. Apparently, Ricks and Montarce think it’s now attractively priced. I don’t. Lilly shares trade for 49 times recent earnings, more than 12 times revenue and about 37 times book value (corporate net worth per share). I think the stock, which has soared on the success of weight-loss drugs, is near-perfectly priced. Growth has slowed to a crawl at United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), partly because of competition from Amazon.com. UPS shares have fallen more than 31% this year. The stock traded at well above $200 in 2021 but now languishes at about $84. Despite all this bad news, Carol Tome, the company’s CEO, spent just over $1 million last month to add to her UPS holdings. Two directors also bought shares in July and August. I think Tome will be rewarded. UPS has a standout return on equity, more than 34%. And the stock trades for less than 13 times earnings. At First Citizens BancShares Inc. (FCNCA), the chief executive Frank Holding Jr. spent just over $1 million last month to add to his considerable hoard of shares. Four other insiders also bought shares in August. Based in Raleigh, N.C., First Citizens is a regional bank with improving profits. I like to see banks earn a return on assets of 1.0% or better. First Citizens has cleared that hurdle in six of the past seven years. The stock looks pretty reasonable to me at 12 times recent earnings. This is the 75th column I’ve written about stocks with insider buying or selling. I can calculate results for 65 of them – all those written from 1999 through a year ago. Bad news first: Stocks I’ve recommended based on insider buying have returned an average of 8.9% in 12 months, trailing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index over the same periods by 1.8 percentage points. Better news: Stocks I said to avoid, even though insiders were buying, have trailed the index by 24 percentage points. Stocks where I discussed sales by insiders have lagged the index by 2.3 percentage points. Stocks where I noted insider buying but made no comment, or an ambiguous comment, have beaten the index by 14.2 percentage points. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: In a hedge fund I run, I own put options on Eli Lilly, betting on a decline.

Title: The world's 3 richest people are worth a combined $1 trillion — about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway

Full Content:
The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Larry Ellison, a cofounder of Oracle, and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, had net worths of $429 billion, $360 billion, and $269 billion as of Monday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Together, they're worth $1.06 trillion, virtually matching Berkshire's market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of Oracle, JPMorgan, and Walmart. It's striking that three individuals are worth as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates about $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has about a 13% stake in Meta. The trio clear the $1 trillion mark because they've hugely increased their wealth as a group. While Musk's fortune has shrunk by about $4 billion this year to date, Ellison's net worth has nearly doubled, surging by $167 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 80% since January 1. Zuckerberg's wealth has jumped by $61 billion, fueled by Meta stock's 30% gain in 2025. Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $486 billion to their joint fortunes, boosting their combined wealth to around $3.3 trillion at Monday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability. Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. Musk could become the world's first trillionaire with the help of a prospective Tesla pay package unveiled last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by about eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances. Jump to

If you’re wondering why bitcoin’s (BTC) price is slipping for the past two hours, the possible culprit is pre-market trading on Wall Street, where shares of Nvidia (NVDA) have dropped nearly 3%. The losses follow an announcement by China's market regulator that Nvidia allegedly violated the country's anti-monopoly laws during its acquisition of Israeli networking company Mellanox Technologies in 2020. The regulator said that Nvidia breached the terms of its conditional approval related to that acquisition, although the specific details of the violations have not been disclosed. The weakness in NVDA is accompanied by poor price action in the crypto market. As of writing, BTC traded at around $114,900, having reached a high of $116,755 earlier today. Top tokens associated with artificial intelligence, such as ICP, RENDER, FET, and GRT, traded over $ 4.5% lower on a 24-hour basis. Chip-maker NVDA is the world's largest publicly listed firm by market value and acts as a barometer for risk sentiment in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies and AI-related tokens. Bitcoin BTC$108,783.53 has historically taken cues from NVDA, with both bottoming out concurrently in late 2022 to embark on a record bull run. The rolling three-month correlation between NVDA and BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF was 0.76 as of Friday, according to data source Macroaxis.

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Over the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to sit down with Shan Aggarwal, Coinbase's newly appointed Chief Business Officer—a first-of-its-kind role at the crypto exchange. Shan’s background defies the conventional tech-executive mold: having started on the medical path with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from UCLA, then pivoting and working his way to a position on the forefront of crypto’s corporate strategy, M&A, and partnerships. From managing capital raising and capital markets activity from Coinbase’s 2018 Series E through its 2021 public listing, to rising as one of the youngest executives at a Fortune 500 today, Shan’s leadership comes at a pivotal moment for the company. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity emerging, Aggarwal is tasked with driving Coinbase's next phase of growth beyond its roots as a retail trading platform. Here's what he shared about the company's strategy, market outlook, and vision for crypto's mainstream future. My role as Chief Business Officer is really about connecting all the dots across Coinbase’s growth engine. I oversee our ecosystem partnerships, business operations and strategy, data and analytics, M&A, and investments. Think of it as being the bridge between our product teams and the market opportunities we're seeing, defining what we should do and how we should execute. I'm focused on how we grow Coinbase, not just as a trading platform, but as the infrastructure that powers the entire crypto economy. That means working with institutions, retail partners, and emerging projects to embed crypto into the core of global financial infrastructure. First, we're focused on building the best trading products by adding support for assets beyond crypto in order to cater to traders. This includes equities, futures and perpetual futures, crypto-native assets, prediction markets, and more. Second, we're leveraging the platform that we've built to enable institutional adoption. Enterprise demand is massive right now, and we've built this amazing platform that's turnkey for partners to offer crypto trading, staking, and more to their end users. Third, we're focused on payments and expanding stablecoin adoption. We're building products that enable first-party payments and a platform for other businesses to offer crypto payments. Throughout these priorities, we remain focused on international expansion: scaling our global footprint and driving our mission to expand economic freedom for people and businesses everywhere. Growth today is about quality over quantity. We're not chasing vanity metrics. It's about deepening relationships with our highest-value customers and expanding our share of their crypto needs. That means driving deeper engagement with our customers by broadening the range of services that we offer to include more than trading – saving, spending, financing, and more. We're also seeing huge opportunities in B2B growth – powering other companies' crypto strategies rather than just serving end consumers directly. We call this Crypto as a Service. With increasing regulatory clarity, we can offer white-label solutions and infrastructure APIs that let other companies integrate crypto without building from scratch. The enterprise builder ecosystem is massive. Think about all the fintech companies, payment processors, and traditional businesses that want crypto capabilities but don't want to deal with compliance, custody, or technical complexity. We become their crypto backbone. We're seeing this through our partnerships with BlackRock and PNC using our infrastructure for their institutional crypto services, and companies like Perplexity integrating crypto data into their platform. These partnerships are game-changing because they bring crypto to users who might never download a crypto app. We’re not just growing our direct user base, we're powering crypto adoption across the entire digital economy. This approach allows us to broaden the base of end users that we serve and accelerate crypto adoption. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. We believe that all of the asset classes in the world will eventually come onchain, and we see stablecoins as one of the first and most important categories. The regulatory clarity that we're starting to see legitimizes stablecoins and sets a clear foundation for growth with a consistent framework for essential components like reserve requirements and transparency. I think we'll see a bifurcation between compliant, transparent stablecoins and everything else. The winners will be the operators who work closely with regulators rather than against them. We’re already starting to see stablecoins get more deeply integrated into the traditional financial system, and I expect that this will continue as stablecoins offer a more efficient, global, and lower-cost rail for moving dollars. Overall, a digital economy needs digital money — stablecoins are that missing piece. And Coinbase is uniquely positioned post-GENIUS Act with broad USDC distribution and the ability to offer industry-leading rewards. We’re building for the long-term and thinking across cycles. In bear markets, we focus on scaling our infrastructure to support the next waves of adoption and investing in long-term builders. In bull markets, we focus on optimizing the customer experience and new product innovation. We're investing heavily in Coinbase as a platform because we believe that with regulatory clarity, more and more businesses will come into the space. We're also building new revenue streams that are less correlated with transaction volumes: stablecoin interest, custody fees, staking rewards, and more. The goal is to be anti-fragile regardless of where prices go. Traditional finance will play a pivotal role in crypto’s mainstream adoption by acting as a bridge between legacy systems and decentralized financial ecosystems. As CBO, I see partnerships with institutions like JPMorgan Chase and American Express as critical to accelerating adoption. These collaborations expand access to crypto, lower barriers for consumers, and integrate crypto into everyday financial activities, such as payments and rewards programs. (Read about Coinbase’s partnership with Perplexity as well.) By leveraging the trust and infrastructure of traditional finance, we can onboard the next wave of users into crypto, helping make economic freedom a reality for millions globally. We’re already seeing this now. We're seeing that those who were skeptical are asking how to custody Bitcoin for their clients, asset managers wanting crypto ETFs and index products, and payment companies seeking stablecoin rails. Our job is to be the infrastructure that lets them participate safely and compliantly. TradFi is meeting crypto, and Coinbase is the bridge. Real-world assets are huge right now. Tokenizing everything from real estate to commodities is unlocking new markets and creating liquidity where it didn’t exist before. DeFi is also maturing beyond just yield farming, becoming the backbone of new, legitimate financial infrastructure. At Coinbase, we believe the future of every asset class is onchain, and we’re laser-focused on building the infrastructure to make that vision a reality. The key is identifying use cases that solve real-world problems at real-world scale, not just fueling crypto-native speculation, although that’s important too. While we're excited about the steps the US has been taking toward regulatory clarity, there are massive opportunities globally in markets where the rules are clearer and the opportunities are immediate. Regions like Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are moving fast on crypto regulation and adoption, and we’re matching that pace by building local partnerships and compliance capabilities tailored to each region. While the US remains a critical market, we won’t let an incomplete regulatory picture here hold back our global ambitions. Crypto is a global phenomenon, and we’re positioning Coinbase to lead on that stage. We have and will continue to be very active on the M&A front. We believe that M&A is core to our growth engine, and a capability that we’ve built up over the years. Once we define a strategy, we always consider build, buy, and partner execution paths. We build core platform capabilities in-house because that's our bread and butter, and we need these to be deeply integrated with our platform. When we acquire, we’re looking for opportunities that accelerate our roadmap and bring differentiated technology, expertise, licensing, and/or a scaled business into our suite. Recent examples include Deribit, the leading crypto options exchange, as well as Spindl, a novel onchain advertising protocol and exchange. With these acquisitions, we’re strengthening our product capabilities and seeding new revenue opportunities. We also believe in the strength of amazing talent and have done smaller acqui-hires to bring in specialized teams. The key is integration – acquisitions only work if they strengthen our core platform rather than becoming isolated silos. I want Coinbase to be the best place for users, institutions, and their end clients to store and grow their wealth. Customers should know that they have access to differentiated opportunities on Coinbase, all through our trusted and intuitive products. That’s what we’re building towards: an everything exchange and full-fledged financial platform. Every asset you want to trade in a one-stop shop, and the best place to grow your money and manage everyday finances, all on crypto rails. Further, I want Coinbase to be synonymous with crypto infrastructure the way AWS is with cloud computing. Base is building a future onchain economy that powers a range of onchain crypto use cases, including financial, social, and much more. Whether you're a startup launching a token, a bank offering crypto services, or a country exploring digital currencies, Coinbase should be the trusted infrastructure partner. We want to be essential rather than optional, powering innovation across every sector that touches crypto. What I learned from my conversation with Shan is that Coinbase isn’t just preparing for the next bull run—it’s building the rails for crypto’s long-term future. The strategy is less about chasing hype cycles and more about embedding crypto into everyday finance, from powering institutional adoption to expanding stablecoin use cases and international markets. Shan made it clear that quality growth, deeper customer relationships, and serving as the “crypto backbone” for enterprises are the levers that matter most right now. I also walked away with a sharper view of Coinbase’s ambition: to become the “everything exchange” for digital assets and the AWS of crypto infrastructure. Whether it’s tokenizing real-world assets, creating compliant and trusted stablecoins, or bridging traditional finance with Web3, Shan’s vision is that Coinbase won’t just participate in the future of money. It will help define it. That’s a bold mission, and one I’ll be watching closely for Coinbase’s next moves.

Title: 10 Questions Everyone’s Asking Coinbase’s First Chief Business Officer

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Over the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to sit down with Shan Aggarwal, Coinbase's newly appointed Chief Business Officer—a first-of-its-kind role at the crypto exchange. Shan’s background defies the conventional tech-executive mold: having started on the medical path with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from UCLA, then pivoting and working his way to a position on the forefront of crypto’s corporate strategy, M&A, and partnerships. From managing capital raising and capital markets activity from Coinbase’s 2018 Series E through its 2021 public listing, to rising as one of the youngest executives at a Fortune 500 today, Shan’s leadership comes at a pivotal moment for the company. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity emerging, Aggarwal is tasked with driving Coinbase's next phase of growth beyond its roots as a retail trading platform. Here's what he shared about the company's strategy, market outlook, and vision for crypto's mainstream future. My role as Chief Business Officer is really about connecting all the dots across Coinbase’s growth engine. I oversee our ecosystem partnerships, business operations and strategy, data and analytics, M&A, and investments. Think of it as being the bridge between our product teams and the market opportunities we're seeing, defining what we should do and how we should execute. I'm focused on how we grow Coinbase, not just as a trading platform, but as the infrastructure that powers the entire crypto economy. That means working with institutions, retail partners, and emerging projects to embed crypto into the core of global financial infrastructure. First, we're focused on building the best trading products by adding support for assets beyond crypto in order to cater to traders. This includes equities, futures and perpetual futures, crypto-native assets, prediction markets, and more. Second, we're leveraging the platform that we've built to enable institutional adoption. Enterprise demand is massive right now, and we've built this amazing platform that's turnkey for partners to offer crypto trading, staking, and more to their end users. Third, we're focused on payments and expanding stablecoin adoption. We're building products that enable first-party payments and a platform for other businesses to offer crypto payments. Throughout these priorities, we remain focused on international expansion: scaling our global footprint and driving our mission to expand economic freedom for people and businesses everywhere. Growth today is about quality over quantity. We're not chasing vanity metrics. It's about deepening relationships with our highest-value customers and expanding our share of their crypto needs. That means driving deeper engagement with our customers by broadening the range of services that we offer to include more than trading – saving, spending, financing, and more. We're also seeing huge opportunities in B2B growth – powering other companies' crypto strategies rather than just serving end consumers directly. We call this Crypto as a Service.

September 15, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz I am thrilled that Ritholtz Wealth Management has been recognized by Barron’s as one of the top 100 RIAs in the country. They report there are 15,870 independent registered investment advisory firms (RIAs); Top 100 means better than the top 1% of all firms.1 When we launched in 2013, twelve years ago (today!), as four advisors and an amazing admin who ran the place (Erika!), Kris Venne convinced all of us that an ensemble practice was the way to go. That turned out to be the best decision we made, as each of us gravitated to what we did best. A flywheel effect followed, with all of the founders expanding their expertise, creating momentum and high double-digit growth for more than a decade. All organically, without outside capital or M&A.2 None of this could have happened without that decision, nor could it have taken place without the 80 fantastic people who make RWM the very special place it is today. This is not false modesty; it is simply an acknowledgement of how proud I am to get to work with so many amazing people. Barron’s has always been special to me personally (I am old school). When I started as a trader 30 years ago(!), every Saturday morning was spent with a big mug of coffee and the print edition of the weekly Barron’s. I was thrilled to be quoted in August 2007 (Placid Times Ahead?), with the GFC looming.3 The first thing I ever published in a mainstream media outlet was a Memo to DC from Wall Street4 – the precursor to Bailout Nation. Thomas Donlan taught me what a great editor can do for your writing – make it all sinew and no fat. I have spoken at multiple Barron’s conferences, seminars, and events; they have always been wonderful experiences. When Barron’s ran a special article on Josh and me in 2020,5, it was thrilling. I was utterly delighted when Batnick was the focus of a profile in 2022.6 Over just this past year, my RWM colleagues and I have been quoted in Barron’s 20 times. To say this is meaningful to me dramatically understates the matter… ~~~ If you are an investor and would like to learn more about how we work with clients, please contact us at Info-AT-RitholtzWealth-DOT-Com. And if you are an advisor or in the financial industry and need some career guidance, we would love to chat with you. Please reach out to the same address, with ‘CAREER’ in the subject line.

Why M&A Isn’t in the Cards. By Andrew Welsch Barron’s, April 22, 2024 Michael Batnick: Crushing It With Content By Steve Garmhausen Barron’s Feb. 4, 2022 Barry Ritholtz and Josh Brown Won’t Predict The Market, But They’ll Talk About Anything Else. By Leslie P. Norton Barron’s, Dec 18, 2020 Previously: Barron’s: Placid Times Ahead? August 6, 2007 A Memo Found in the Street (*Mirror) By Barry L. Ritholtz Sept 29, 2008 Batnick: Crushing It With Content (February 6, 2022) __________ 1. Top 0.62% to be precise. There are ~17,000 firms, of which 15kish are registered with the S.E.C. That is to say nothing of all of the hybrid Broker-Dealers, and all the advisors at wire houses. FINRA reports there are 634,500 registered representatives in total. 2. When Blackrock decided in 2022 that their 2015 purchase of Future Advisor (their robo) was no longer their core focus, we agreed to purchase the book in 2023 and service those clients in our digital platform, with a live human advisor included. 3. Placid Times Ahead? By Jim McTague, Aug 06, 2007 4. A Memo Found in the Street By Barry L. Ritholtz Barron’s, Sept 29, 2008 As I wrote at the time, “It was a pleasure working with Thom Donlan on this, who turned my blunt, meandering scribbles into a razor-sharp scalpel.” 5. Barry Ritholtz and Josh Brown Won’t Predict The Market, But They’ll Talk About Anything Else. By Leslie P. Norton Barron’s, Dec 18, 2020 6. Michael Batnick: Crushing It With Content By Steve Garmhausen Barron’s Feb. 4, 2022 ~~~ Disclosure: Barron’s ranked Ritholtz Wealth Management (RWM) #100 in their 2025 “Barron’s Top RIA Firms” in September, 2025. The annual ranking is based on data compiled for RWM’s registered investment adviser and was based on June 30th data, including annual figures for the previous three years. No fee was paid for participation in the ranking. The ranking is based on firm surveys, and filings with the regulatory databases were used to cross-check the data provided. The rankings are based on assets managed by the firms, growth, technology spending, staff diversity, succession planning, and other metrics. The formula Barron’s uses to rank firms is proprietary. The formula features three major categories of calculations: (1) Assets (2) Revenue (3) Quality of practice. The number of firms included in the 2025 ranking was 100. For the first time, Barron’s is ranking the largest registered investment advisor firms separately from its broader RIA ranking. For our list of mega RIAs, we selected firms that manage 2% or more of the total assets of all ranking applicants. This year, that creates a threshold of $70 billion in assets.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher to begin a week featuring the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates; China is investigating Nvidia (NVDA) on antitrust charges stemming from a 2020 acquisition; U.S. officials said they are close to a resolution on Chinese ownership of TikTok as it faces a U.S. ban; Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging in premarket trading as CEO Elon Musk buys about $1 billion worth of company stock; and UnitedHealth Group (NVDA) reportedly is hiring allies of President Donald Trump as it faces investigations in Washington. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors look ahead to this week's Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. S&P 500 futures are 0.2% higher by nearly 0.2% after the benchmark index rose 1.6% last week. Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are pointing slightly higher after posting gains last week, with the Nasdaq hitting another record closing high Friday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at under $115,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Oil futures are higher. Gold futures are ticking lower. China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Nvidia (NVDA) violated its antitrust laws with its 2020 acquisition of networking equipment maker Mellanox Technologies, and that they would further investigate the chipmaking giant. The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Madrid to continue negotiations on tariffs. Nvidia shares are roughly 1.5% lower in premarket trading. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. and China are close to a resolution on social media app TikTok, which is facing a ban in the U.S. over its Chinese ownership. Bessent said that a deal to divest TikTok from its Chinese parent ByteDance could hinge on other trade demands, per media reports. "We are not willing to sacrifice national security for a social media app," Bessent said, according to Reuters. President Donald Trump has said he was looking for new buyers of the popular social media app, which was banned by the Biden administration. Tesla (TSLA) shares are soaring 8% in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk disclosed he purchased around $1 billion of the company’s stock on Friday, according to an SEC filing. Musk purchased around 2.57 million shares at various price points. It was his largest purchase of stock on the open market since February 2020, according to CNBC. The move comes as the company is asking shareholders to approve a pay package for Musk that could total nearly $1 trillion if certain performance milestones are met. UnitedHealth Group (NVDA) is hiring allies of President Trump and meeting with top administration officials as it faces government investigations, The Wall Street Journal reported. UnitedHealth, which is facing a criminal probe into its lucrative Medicare Advantage business, "increased its spending on lobbyists and lawyers with deep ties to President Trump's administration, including Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for the president, and Jesse Panuccio, who was a senior Justice Department official in Trump's first term," the Journal said. It added that CEO Stephen Hemsley "recently met with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles to discuss Medicare and other issues."

Title: Tether’s long-awaited arrival to U.S. raises 3 big questions
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/15/tether-united-states-arrival-paolo-ardoino-analysis/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T11:42:15Z
Full Content:
Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Don’t look now but an overseas crypto colossus has just strode onto America’s shores. I’m talking, of course, about Tether. For over a decade, the wildcat stablecoin firm operated as a global nomad before announcing in January it would set up a physical headquarters in El Salvador. Then, on Friday, founder Paolo Ardoino turned up in New York City to announce Tether would be launching a new U.S.-compliant stablecoin called USAT. It’s a remarkable turnabout. For years, Tether was viewed as an outlaw that turned a blind eye to criminals who used its USDT stablecoin to launder profits, and to facilitate pig-butchering and other scams. Now, the company is in the tent with other respectable crypto companies. The CEO of its U.S. entity is none other than Bo Hines, the 30-year-old former Yale wide receiver whose most recent gig was at the White House, helping implement President Donald Trump’s ambitious crypto agenda. It must have cost a pretty penny to land Hines, who recently told Fortune he was weighing over 50 job offers. Fortunately, for Tether, money is pretty much an afterthought since the firm says it made $13 billion in profits in 2024, which gives it a staggering warchest to make a play for the U.S. market, which is dominated by rival Circle. All of this raises three questions. The first is whether there is room for another big player in the U.S. stablecoin market, which has so far played out as a winner-take-all contest in favor of Tether’s main rival, Circle. Marquee brands like PayPal and Ripple have tried to make inroads but have failed to capture even 5% of the U.S. market from Circle’s USDC. This suggests Circle’s existing customer base is a sticky one that is not looking to hop to another stablecoin. This does, though, raise the question of whether Circle is ready for a competitor like Tether. The company’s competitive advantage till now has been on the regulatory front, where its compliance-first strategy has served it well. That strategy, though, hasn’t trained it to go up against a knife-fighter like Tether, a company that is deeply crypto-native and whose corporate culture is nimble and lean. This likely explains why Circle’s shares dropped 6% on Friday. The final question posed by Tether’s entry into the U.S. is why it decided to create a new stablecoin in the first place rather than simply going to market with its popular USDT coin. This raises the perennial question of whether Tether’s USDT reserves are up to snuff. For years now, the company has produced quarterly “attestations” to show its house is in order—but has never submitted to an audit by a Big Four firm that would settle the question once and for all. Is this going to change now that Tether, under U.S. law, will have to arrange full-blown audits for USAT? We’ll see. A final note: Thanks to all of you who sent kind words about the return of the Fortune Crypto newsletter. It is so good to be back in your inboxes to offer you a timely (and succinct!) take on the biggest stories in blockchain. Read on for recent highlights from the news. And if you haven’t already, sign up here. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Can Stripe be trusted? Boosters say the payment giant’s Tempo blockchain will decentralize, but skeptics warn it “returns us back to the ass-covering hell” that Satoshi warned of. (The Defiant) Beware Bitcoin ATMs: The machines are facilitating a mind-blowing level of senior fraud, according to a new DOJ lawsuit, which accuses Athena Bitcoin of turning a blind eye while charging fees around 25%. (The American Prospect) Blackrock to put ETFs on chain: Tokenization—putting real world assets on a blockchain —has been gathering steam for a while, but is now poised to take a big leap forward as the world’s biggest asset manager moves to put its flagship Bitcoin ETF on chain.

Title: 21 Companies Hiring Hybrid-Remote Jobs In 2025

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Between remote work and full-on RTO mandates, emerges a lovechild: the hybrid work model. Hybrid remote jobs are increasingly popular post-pandemic amongst both employers and workers because they hit the sweet spot. Companies gain in-person engagement, visibility, and the team morale that comes through vibing at the office. And employees get to work from home for some part of the week, which means they obtain the best of both worlds. As far as flexibility and returning to the office is concerned, companies have increasingly been sharpening their hybrid remote model approach. This has led to three general types of hybrid remote work: The first scenario, is where employees get to pick what days of the week or month they work in the office versus from home, as long as they adhere to a certain percentage or fixed office versus home ratio. The second, is where employers mandate a certain number of days per week for in-office work. The third option is for employers to mandate specific days, i.e., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, for in-office work, while the other days are for remote working. Other hybrid approaches that work for some employers include: If you’re keen on experiencing the remote work flexible lifestyle while also enjoying just a little bit of in-office culture, FlexJobs has a list of employers that you should keep on your radar. They gathered this list through analyzing “approximately 60,000 companies and their hybrid job posting histories in the FlexJobs database between September 1, 2024, and August 31, 2025. The featured companies are recognized for having the highest volume of hybrid job openings over the last year and are considered strong prospects for job seekers,” they said. This led to their Top 100 Hybrid Companies List, which also saw 60 newcomers compared to last year’s report. The top 10 employers on this list primarily feature finance and healthcare, while other industries such as communications and defence are included: Lockheed Martin was one of the newcomers to this list and claimed the top spot for posting the most hybrid remote jobs over the one-year period. Some of the other employers in this list include: Now that you have this list, here’s what you should do next: Follow these companies on LinkedIn (if you’re not following them already). Then, identify the hybrid roles they’re advertizing for, which align with your area of expertise or your transferable skills. Next, study their tone, their values, their work culture, and the reviews from their employees on Glassdoor, as well as the corporate tone of their management and senior employees on LinkedIn. And finally, use this intelligence as the basis for crafting your resume and cover letter (and even your LinkedIn profile) so your job application can be tailored specifically to what they’re looking for in their next exceptional employee. Show that you’re aligned with their mission and values. Looking for more remote-friendly companies hiring now in 2025?

Title: Tesla stock is rising. Why Elon Musk is a ‘wartime’ CEO.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Tesla stock was rising in premarket trading Monday as CEO Elon Musk gets ready for an artificial intelligence “war." Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were up 1.2% at $400.61 in early trading, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were each rising about 0.2%. The move comes after the stock rallied 13% this past week. Exactly why it rose that much is open for some debate. Technical traders became excited by the recent momentum that took Tesla past the highs reached in the Spring. EV sales were strong in August, according to industry data providers. Buyers appear to be rushing to beat the removal of the $7,500 federal EV purchase tax credit, which goes away at the end of September. Tesla has also received some approvals to begin testing its self-driving taxi service in Las Vegas. Tesla launched a small AI-trained robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes AI is what has investors excited. “Investors are starting to see through the near-term demand issues for Tesla and recognize that Tesla is in a pole position to be a clear leader in the autonomous market opportunity, with Robotaxis set to scale to 30 to 35 cities in the US over the next year," he wrote on Sunday. Tesla sold about 721,000 cars in the first half of 2025, down about 13% year over year. That’s the demand weakness to which Ives is referring. Selling fewer cars isn’t good news, but AI simply matters more than car sales these days. “We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla in its history as a company," added Ives. He calls AI a $1 trillion opportunity for the company. “Musk is driving this [AI] vision and is now in a ‘wartime CEO’ mode, which is music to the ears of Tesla bulls with this AI Arms Race happening across the tech world." The arms race might be an apt analogy. AI is driving the stock market with Magnificent Seven stocks valued at some $20 trillion. ChatGPT parent OpenAI is valued at about $500 billion, while Amazon.com, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on AI computing. Some of that is for self-driving cars, Tesla’s territory. Amazon owns self-driving company Zoox. Alphabet controls Waymo. Ives says Musk is the right leader for Tesla at a time like this, calling him the company’s “most important asset." A new pay package, worth up to $1 trillion if all performance incentives are hit, should keep Musk at Tesla until 2030 and beyond. Ives is a Tesla bull, rating shares Buy with a $500 price target for shares, the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. The rest of the Street isn’t as bullish. The average analyst price target is about $318 a share, and 44% of analysts rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 2% so far this year, and up about 72% over the past 12 months.

Title: Arista Stock To $300?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/arista-stock-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not sell GPUs. It does not create AI models. And it seldom makes headlines like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nevertheless, Arista has quietly established itself as one of the most significant technology firms in the market. Strong results for H1 2025 and elevated guidance have propelled the stock to its all-time high. Shares have risen by 60% in the last year, compared to an 18% increase for the S&P 500. However, the larger question remains: could Arista stock potentially double from its current position—rising from $150 to $300? To address this, let’s examine revenues, margins, and valuation. Additionally, if you’re interested in gaining exposure with less volatility than betting on a single stock, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. is worth considering. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns surpassing 91% since its initiation. In a separate note, see – Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $360? Arista is no longer merely a networking vendor. It has evolved into a growth engine directly associated with the AI expansion. In Q2 2025, the company reported revenue of $2.205 billion, reflecting a 30% year-over-year increase, and surpassing Wall Street projections. Over the preceding three years, Arista’s revenue has increased at an average rate of 32%. Indeed, revenue has ascended from $6.3 billion to $8.0 billion in just the past twelve months. What’s propelling this growth? The AI expansion. Hyperscalers and cloud behemoths—from Microsoft to Meta—are investing heavily in data centers. High-performance networking is the crucial element of these infrastructures, and Arista is providing the foundation. Importantly, this is not a temporary phenomenon. Management has upgraded its Q3 guidance to $2.25 billion, highlighting that momentum is ongoing. For a hardware company, this growth trajectory closely resembles that of software. Revenue growth is thrilling. However, margins reveal the true narrative. In Q2, Arista achieved a 40% net margin—surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Microsoft. Contemplate that for a moment. A networking hardware firm exhibiting software-level profitability. The key lies in EOS (Extensible Operating System), Arista’s cloud-native platform. EOS transforms switches and routers into programmable, software-defined equipment that hyperscalers depend on. This is why nearly 54% of revenue converts into operating cash flow, making it one of the best ratios in the S&P 500. Over the past year, Arista generated close to $4.0 billion in operating cash flow and $3.3 billion in net income, all while maintaining $8.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet with no debt. These margins are not cyclical; they are structural. They offer a buffer during downturns, as demonstrated by the quick recoveries following the 2020 COVID crash and the 2022 inflation-induced selloff. Consult ANET Dip Buyer Analyses for insight into how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Here is where the discussion intensifies. Arista trades at 58.5x earnings, 23.9x sales, and almost 48x free cash flow. On the surface, that appears steep—more akin to SaaS firms than traditional networking counterparts. However, context is critical. Deep-rooted partnerships with hyperscalers, AI-driven demand, and a robust balance sheet all rationalize a premium. Should revenue compound at 25–30% annually while margins remain above 40%, today’s valuation could rapidly normalize. So, is it feasible for Arista to double? At $150 per share, Arista’s $190 billion market capitalization represents approximately $3.2 billion in net income based on its current ~59× P/E ratio. For the stock to reach $300 (a $380 billion market cap), earnings would have to roughly double. At the current high multiple, that translates to about $6–7 billion in profits, or roughly $16 billion in revenue, assuming a 40% net margin—a target consistent with long-term projections. However, if the multiple decreases to a more justifiable 40×, Arista would need to achieve nearly $9–10 billion in earnings, or $24 billion in revenue, to support the same valuation. In other terms, the journey to $300 is plausible within the next 3-4 years, but it is contingent on both sustained growth and the market’s willingness to continue granting the stock a premium multiple. The risks are significant—cloud expenditure could decelerate, priorities in AI might change, and multiples could reduce. Our analysis suggests that a favorable outcome is probable, albeit one that may require investors and clients to adopt a long-term perspective. That being said, investing in a single stock can be precarious. You may want to look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an agile way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while curtailing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

September 15, 2025 15:49 IST 'India is quickly becoming the beating heart of modern chess, and its role as an economic power is more and more visible.' Goa will host the 2025 World Corporate Chess Championship alongside the FIDE World Cup 2025 slated during October-November, said the International Chess Federation or FIDE. FIDE has opened the registration for gthe World Corporate Chess Championship 2025 which will be held in three stages. According to FIDE the title-winning corporate will be crowned 'The Smartest Company in the World'. 'The championship will unfold across three stages; online qualifiers, online knockout matches, and the over-the-board finals in Goa, India, held alongside the prestigious FIDE World Cup 2025,' FIDE said. The tournament will once again highlight how certain principles of chess such as strategy, adaptability and calculated decision-making, mirror the challenges of the business world. By bringing employees, executives, and business owners together over the chessboard, FIDE aims to create a global platform for corporate pride, networking, and competition. 'The World Corporate Chess Championship has grown from a novel idea into a global showcase, mixing serious business with serious chess. In 2021 due to the pandemic it was held entirely online, but in New York 2024, teams from top companies around the world -- Google, Deutscheâ¯Bank, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, UBS, to name a few, competed in this event on the most iconic stage,' FIDE CEO Emil Sutovsky said. In 2025, FIDE is aligning the chess and corporate world even tighter, staging the final stage of the event in Goa, alongside the FIDE World Cup. 'India is quickly becoming the beating heart of modern chess, and its role as an economic power is more and more visible -- this double-stage event reflects the momentum,' Sutovsky said. According to FIDE, teams representing any legally recognised company can participate in the event. Each team consists of four players and a captain, who may also be a player. Eligible participants include employees and board members who have been with the company since March 1, 2025, as well as business owners holding more than 10% of the company's shares. Companies may register more than one team. The 2025 edition will be played in three stages: Online Qualifiers (Lichess.org, October 11 to 12) Online Knockout (Lichess.org, October 18) Finals (Over-the-board, Goa, November 14 to 16) The Online Knockout will be played as two-match duels with the same 10+3 time control. In the event of a tie, a sudden death game will decide the winner. Eight teams will advance to the finals. The finals in Goa will feature the eight knockout winners plus invited and wild card teams, for a maximum of 16 teams. They will begin with a group stage before progressing to semi-finals and a final. The entry fee is €500 per team, and multiple teams per company are allowed. Last year's edition, held in New York, saw 64 teams representing 46 companies from 26 countries across four continents competing in the online qualifying stage. Chessify won the title in 2024.

As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com With the number of ETF strategies exploding, figuring out which ones are actually worthwhile is growing more complicated than ever. Exchange-traded funds brought in $540 billion in assets in the first half of the year alone, and the sheer number of ETF launches is overcrowding the markets, according to ETF.com president Dave Nadig. This time next year, the number of ETFs in the US could reach 9,000, given the current pace of launches. “That makes everybody’s job really miserable,” he said during a panel at the Future Proof conference in Huntington Beach, California. “You have to wade through that to find out what’s actually worth having.” There are a few major trends impacting ETF investors heading into 2026, according to Nadig, who previously worked on some of the earliest ETFs as a managing director at Barclays Global Investors. Cheap funds are experiencing massive inflows while products with higher fees are driving revenue for a handful of lucky first-movers. “I think we may have reached the bottom on the fee wars,” Nadig said. Despite all the active ETF hype, most of this year’s inflows have gone to “non-traditional” funds, such as synthetic income funds, which track an index using derivative contracts instead of actually buying the securities. Other options-based income products have generated $366 million in new fee revenue this year, according to Nadig, with leveraged and inverse ETFs, as well as buffers, being the other two major successful categories. Interestingly, it’s not Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock making all the money right now, Nadig said. Issuers such as First Trust and Innovator are raking in hundreds of millions on the backs of their buffered and derivatives-based products. “A lot of this [gets] called active management and certainly charges active management-like fees,” he said. “But it’s not the kind of active management you’re going to get from Tom Lee down at Fundstrat, where he’s picking stocks.” Since leveraged, inverse and buffered products are newer, issuers are focusing on them to gain a foothold in the market. Cheap Date. Although the vast majority of investments are in extraordinarily cheap products, more sophisticated funds can still be worthwhile strategies for issuers, Nadig said. That’s because a smaller group of very expensive funds accounts for an outsized share of revenue: For example, JPMorgan and Toroso Investments — the maker of YieldMax ETFs — dominate the synthetic income bracket. “It doesn’t mean that there’s no money to be made elsewhere,” Nadig said. “But the expensive stuff is just kid-in-a-candy-store money.” The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. Amid a reversal in tax incentives that had started to buoy clean energy technologies, investors have pulled money from linked ETFs. The company, which sponsors a nearly $5 billion Bitcoin ETF along with ARK, is nixing the three other ETFs in that partnership. The SEC and CFTC recently issued a rare joint statement encouraging applications for new spot crypto products. Disney is the comeback kid of Wall Street, and other streaming giants are following suit. The company’s new U.S. Equity Total Return ETF invests in other exchange-traded funds in a way that minimizes dividend payments. If approved, Tuttle Capital Management would buck an industry trend in the options it uses, according to the company’s CEO. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/sp-500-set-to-surge-30/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:48Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In what's shaping up to be a pivotal week for global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet on September 16-17. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While that’s the prevailing expectation, the Fed has a history of surprising markets. If they cut rates by 50 basis points instead of 25, it would be an unexpected move. Looking at past events, such surprises can serve as powerful catalysts for major market rallies. Our analysis shows that a move like this could potentially boost the market by 30%. That said, for investors looking for growth potential with lower exposure to the volatility of individual equities, consider the High Quality Portfolio. Since its inception, this portfolio has built a strong track record, consistently outperforming its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with cumulative returns exceeding 91%. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Recent history shows how impactful unexpected Fed moves can be. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the Fed made two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 totaling 150 basis points. The first was a 50 basis point cut on March 3rd, followed by an even larger 100 basis point cut on March 15th that brought rates to near-zero. While markets initially dropped to around 2,237 on March 23, 2020, the aggressive action helped stabilize confidence. This sparked a massive rally, with the S&P 500 climbing to around 4,797 by January 2022—a gain of about 115% in under two years. Similarly, the 2019 rate cut cycle demonstrated the power of surprise. Beginning in July 2019, the Fed made three 25 basis point cuts, some of which were partly unexpected. These came after a period of rate hikes and helped fuel a major rally. From its low of about 2,346 in December 2018, the S&P 500 surged to around 3,393 by February 2020, a 45% gain in just 14 months. These examples show a clear pattern: when the Fed acts more aggressively than expected, it can ignite strong, sustained rallies. The current market setup is unique. The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs around 6,584, unlike past rate-cut cycles, which often came during economic crises. The market has already priced in a 25 basis point cut, so a bigger move would be a major surprise. Adding complexity is political pressure from the Trump administration for deeper rate cuts. This could influence the Fed’s decision and the market’s response. Based on historical trends, the size of a surprise cut correlates directly with the rally potential. For perspective, the 45% rally starting in 2019 followed a total of 75 basis points in cuts, while the 115% rally from 2020 came after 150 basis points in emergency cuts. So a 50 basis point cut likely wouldn’t drive a rally on that scale, but a 30% gain is a realistic possibility. History shows that surprises can be powerful catalysts. There are compelling reasons for the Fed to go for an aggressive 50 basis point cut. The biggest is the element of surprise—since markets don’t expect it, such a move would be a strong signal. Lower rates also add liquidity, fueling growth and supporting multiple expansion as investors pay more for earnings. There’s also political pressure from the Trump administration, which could hint at more cuts to come. Of course, the Fed might do something else unexpected, like holding rates steady and maintaining its hawkish stance. That would likely hit markets hard. A lack of action could send the S&P 500 index down by as much as 8%. Inflation fears are real. See – Will Inflation Data Crush The S&P 500? – for more details. Even with the potential for a rally, there are key risks to consider. The upcoming Fed meeting is high stakes, and any deviation from the expected 25 basis point cut could spark big market moves. The consistent market swings after Fed meetings since 2019 highlight the importance of risk management. For instance, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 while avoiding much of this Fed-induced volatility, delivering cumulative returns of over 91% since inception—far better than broad market indices. A surprise 50-basis-point or larger Fed rate cut could still trigger a significant rally for the S&P 500, potentially 30% in the medium term based on historical precedent. However, the 2019 cycle offers a better comparison than the crisis-driven 2020 response, suggesting any rally would be more moderate but still substantial.

Title: Buy Sell Or Hold Credo Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/buy-sell-or-hold-credo-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Credo Technology stock (NASDAQ:CRDO) surged nearly 10% on Wednesday and has more than doubled over the past quarter, elevating its market capitalization to approximately $28 billion. The firm offers high-speed connectivity solutions for Ethernet and AI infrastructure, including integrated circuits, active electrical cables, and IP licensing. This recent stock surge follows a spectacular first-quarter report, which ended on August 2, 2025, showing revenues soaring 274% year-over-year to $223.1 million. Credo also introduced its Bluebird Digital Signal Processor, a low-power, high-efficiency solution designed to reduce latency and power consumption in GPU communications – a known bottleneck for scaling next-generation AI workloads. The company also highlighted significant business achievements with hyperscalers, who play a crucial role in the AI rollout. So, is Credo stock still a worthwhile investment after the substantial rally, or is it too late? The AI narrative is pivotal to Credo’s expansion. The Bluebird DSP directly addresses power and efficiency issues in optical transceivers, essential for data centers powering generative AI. In Q1 FY’26, three hyperscalers each accounted for over 10% of revenue, with a fourth beginning to increase its collaboration with the company. Management anticipates these four will remain primary contributors through fiscal 2026, while two additional hyperscalers are expected to join. This provides high visibility into future growth, with the company forecasting approximately 120% revenue growth in FY26, significantly surpassing earlier estimates of 85%. For context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) reported they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. If realized, this would establish Credo as a preferred supplier of AI infrastructure components during a time when cloud and chip industry leaders are rushing to expand their GPU clusters. This positions Credo as more than merely a chip supplier; it is emerging as a crucial enabler of hyperscaler AI developments. Naturally, investors must consider valuation. Credo is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 47.3x and a price-to-earnings multiple of 227x – substantial premiums compared to the S&P 500’s 3.3x and 24.2x, respectively. Yet, these elevated multiples indicate more than just hype. Revenues have increased by 176% in the past year to $600 million, with quarterly growth surpassing the S&P 500 by over 40 times. Profitability is also strong, with a 20.8% net margin compared to 12.6% for the broader index, and the balance sheet remains robust, with only $16 million in debt against $480 million in cash. Therefore, overall, Credo is not a speculative cash-burning AI venture, but a profitable, cash-generating growth enterprise with minimal leverage. So, is it too late to invest? That ultimately depends on your risk tolerance. For investors focused on value, Credo certainly appears costly, and its history of dramatic fluctuations – including a 62% drop during the inflation crisis of 2022 – underscores the risks involved. However, for growth-oriented investors, the narrative is significantly more enticing. Credo is addressing one of the largest bottlenecks in AI data centers — power and latency — while strengthening its partnerships with hyperscalers who are central to the AI expansion. If adoption continues at the current rate, the current high multiples may well be justified by the company’s exceptional growth potential. In this regard, Credo stands out as a high-risk but potentially high-reward investment in the infrastructure sector of the AI revolution. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices. What accounts for this? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index, experiencing less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nebius Stock To $450?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-nebius-stock-keep-surging/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Approximately one year ago, AI-centric cloud company Nebius (NASDAQ: NBIS) was largely dismissed as a leftover from Russian technology. Emerging from a split with Yandex, Russia's leading internet firm, it appeared destined to remain on the periphery of global technology. Instead, it has orchestrated one of the most impressive comebacks in the sector. Since it began trading last October at $20 per share, Nebius has rallied to $89, elevating its market capitalization to over $21 billion – a 350% increase in just about twelve months. Unlike many "story stocks," this increase is rooted in fundamentals: revenues are projected to rise from $117 million in 2024 to an anticipated $568 million in 2025 and $1.5 billion in 2026. Further fueling the momentum, Nebius recently secured a landmark $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to provide GPU infrastructure capacity over the following five years – validating its capabilities. Now, some of the biggest names in technology – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) – have built multi-trillion dollar valuations based on their cloud infrastructure. With AI now serving as the key growth driver in tech, we present an argument for how Nebius can leverage its exclusive AI focus to pave a path towards a valuation exceeding $100 billion in the upcoming years. Nebius is not a general-purpose cloud like AWS or Azure. It belongs to a new category of "Neoclouds" – infrastructure platforms designed exclusively for AI workloads, with computing, storage, networking, and management tools all optimized for training and operating large-scale AI models. While hyperscalers attempt to cater to everyone, Nebius concentrates on providing exactly what AI labs and organizations require most: high-performance, dedicated GPU infrastructure. The Microsoft agreement reinforces this strategy. The software giant has repeatedly encountered shortages in AI computing, exacerbated by its obligations to supply OpenAI. To bridge this gap, Microsoft will obtain dedicated capacity from a new Nebius data center in Vineland, New Jersey, starting later this year. From ChatGPT transforming how we operate and conduct research to AlphaFold accelerating drug discovery and generative tools reshaping creative workflows, AI is driving nearly every sector – and Nebius could be powering the essential infrastructure that enables it all. Before we delve into the specific figures for Nebius stock, let’s recognize a crucial reality. Investing in individual stocks, particularly in high-growth firms like Nebius, carries inherent volatility. While the potential for upside is significant, the journey can be tumultuous. That said, if you're looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to holding individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently surpassed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 91% since its launch. This diversified strategy can offer exposure to high-quality growth firms while managing the risks associated with individual stocks. Now, with this context in mind, let’s explore what makes Nebius's unique narrative so compelling. Indeed, there is considerable competition in this industry, but Nebius sets itself apart in a few key ways despite the competitive landscape. Firstly, the company maintains a close partnership with AI chip frontrunner Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which manufactures the most advanced GPUs and essentially establishes industry benchmarks. Nvidia serves as both a significant partner and investor, having participated in a $700 million funding round last year and holds over 1 million Nebius shares. This partnership may provide Nebius preferential access to Nvidia’s most desired GPUs, such as the Blackwell super chips, granting it a vital advantage in a market where supply continues to lag behind demand. Another key differentiator is Nebius’s vertically integrated model. The company designs its own servers internally, bypassing OEMs and collaborating directly with manufacturers to cut costs, enhance performance, and quickly integrate the latest GPUs. This control accelerates deployment cycles and boosts efficiency — with infrastructure costs reportedly as low as $0.025 per GPU-hour. The company also provides transparent billing and imposes no lock-ins, making it particularly attractive to AI-first startups, where many innovations are taking place. This could help it better secure early customers. Let’s assess the scale of the opportunity. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads with an annual revenue run-rate exceeding $120 billion, while Microsoft’s Azure exceeded $75 billion in the previous fiscal year. AI workloads are even more compute- and memory-intensive, indicating that the AI cloud market may ultimately outstrip the current general-purpose cloud in terms of scale. The AI cloud segment is growing much more rapidly than the general-purpose cloud, as generative and automation use cases proliferate. Moreover, in contrast to hyperscalers, AI-centered clouds deploy specialized GPU clusters, liquid cooling, and tailored orchestration software, allowing for premium pricing, enhanced customer lock-in, and accelerated growth. The Microsoft agreement validates Nebius’s technology and could create opportunities for further partnerships with hyperscalers or enterprises. The numbers support the bullish perspective: consensus projections indicate revenue will increase from $568 million in 2025 to roughly $1.5 billion in 2026. Extending the trend, if Nebius compounds at 50% annually from 2026 through 2030, revenue could reach approximately $7.6 billion. Notably, the Microsoft contract alone could contribute over $3.5 billion annually by 2028, rendering the $7.6 billion figure possibly conservative. For context, Nebius currently trades at about 40× the estimated revenue for 2025. Even if this multiple contracts to 15× sales – which is not unusual for high-growth cloud infrastructure – that suggests a market cap of $114 billion. For comparison, Microsoft, valued at over $3.5 trillion, trades at nearly 12x sales, so this multiple should be reasonable for an earlier growth stage company like Nebius. With roughly 250 million shares outstanding, this translates to a stock price of around $459 per share by 2030. That represents an upside of more than 5x from the current stock price of $89. The bullish case for Nebius is predicated on the flawless execution of its significant Microsoft contract, ongoing preferential access to Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs, and financing rapid expansion without severely impacting its margins. Microsoft will also represent a disproportionate share of future revenue, leaving Nebius highly reliant on a single customer. Additionally, with the stock already trading at nearly 40× FY25 revenue – significantly above peers – any slowdown could adversely affect its valuation. It's also important to consider Nebius’s background and acknowledge its origins. The company was established as an offshoot of Yandex, Russia’s tech giant, and founder Arkady Volozh faced EU sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, which made investors apprehensive. Since then, Nebius has fully severed ties with Yandex’s Russian operations and has relocated to Amsterdam with an international engineering team. The EU lifted its sanctions last year, alleviating most of the geopolitical concerns, though the company’s Russian roots remain a small residual risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of outperforming its benchmark that includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a smoother investment experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Native Markets team said they will soon start a testing phase for USDH mints and redemptions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Validators on Hyperliquid have voted to hand the long-reserved USDH ticker to Native Markets, clearing the way for the project to issue the network’s native stablecoin. Native Markets co-founder Max Fiege announced the outcome on Sept. 14, saying HYPE stakers and validator operators supported the proposal. According to him: “Native Markets has been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid. Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward.” Native Markets’ victory came against stiff competition from major stablecoin issuers, including Ethena, Paxos, and Agora. Each rival pitched aggressive revenue-sharing models to strengthen Hyperliquid’s ecosystem, offering to funnel yield into buybacks or ecosystem growth. However, Native Markets’ proposal resonated with validators thanks to its detailed reserve structure, compliance safeguards, and the leadership team’s deep involvement with the decentralized exchange. Native Markets was formed specifically to develop USDH, with the aim of reducing the $200 million in annual value leakage the Hyperliquid protocol has faced. The project submitted its proposal less than two hours after Hyperliquid first announced the stablecoin, stressing its determination to lead the effort. The proposal outlined that USDH will be issued directly on Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM network. Reserves will be fully backed by US Treasuries and cash, with on-chain assets managed by Superstate through Bridge and off-chain reserves initially held by BlackRock. For compliance, issuance will run through Bridge, which already holds money transmission and MSB licenses in both the US and Europe. Meanwhile, revenue from the stablecoin reserves will be split evenly, with half directed to HYPE buybacks and the Assistance Fund, and the other half dedicated to expanding USDH adoption. According to Feige, his team is committed to deploying both the HIP-1 version of USDH and an ERC-20 token. He said the rollout would begin with a capped testing phase, allowing traders to mint and redeem tokens in transactions of up to $800. Once initial trials are complete, the team plans to open the USDH/USDC spot order book and enable unlimited mints and redemptions. To accommodate institutional-scale activity, Native Markets also intends to make its API available for large-volume traders during testing. According to Fiege, this approach ensures robust liquidity and smooth integration into Hyperliquid’s trading environment. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Bitcoin Escaped Nvidia's Clutches, Is AI Next?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/bitcoin-escaped-nvidias-clutches-is-ai-next/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) supremacy in artificial intelligence accelerators has made it one of the most valuable firms globally, with a market capitalization exceeding $4 trillion. Its financial results have been robust, with revenue climbing 56% compared to the same period last year, reaching $47 billion in the last quarter, and net margins consistently surpassing 50%. However, history serves as a warning. In the world of cryptocurrency, GPUs once held the top position but were ultimately substituted by custom-made ASICs that provided greater efficiency. With Broadcom recently announcing a substantial $10 billion order for its specialized AI chips, reportedly from OpenAI, investors are starting to wonder if AI might follow a comparable path. What could this imply for Nvidia’s long-term future? Regardless of how fast-growing and enticing, putting money into a single stock entails significant risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to mitigate stock-specific risk while offering potential upside. When Bitcoin was initially introduced, mining occurred using standard CPUs. Shortly after, miners realized that GPUs were more adept at handling the parallel computations demanded by Bitcoin's algorithm. Eventually, GPUs emerged as the preferred hardware, only to be later overtaken by FPGAs and eventually ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). ASICs introduced a significant transformation. These chips, designed specifically for Bitcoin’s hashing algorithm, provided orders of magnitude more efficiency and speed compared to GPUs. A single ASIC miner could achieve terahashes per second (essentially, the rate at which a machine can execute these guesses), while using considerably less power than setups centered around GPUs. The downside was specialization: ASICs were limited to mining Bitcoin or similar algorithms, while GPUs could easily transition between different coins or even be adapted for gaming and AI. This led to a complete restructuring of the industry. Mining became capital-intensive and was dominated by large industrial entities capable of investing in extensive ASIC farms. GPUs remain popular among smaller miners, hobbyists, and those mining altcoins that resist ASICs or are tailored for GPU mining. Nvidia’s GPUs set the standard for training large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, and they support the majority of the AI infrastructure at hyperscalers. Over the past three years, tens of billions were invested in GPU clusters, driving Nvidia’s swift ascent. For perspective, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) anticipated spending a combined $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. However, the economics surrounding AI may also be shifting. Training large models remains heavily reliant on GPUs, yet this is likely to be a relatively initial-heavy task. As the most readily available data on the Internet is utilized by LLMs (large language models) with diminishing returns from larger models, training growth could moderate somewhat. The majority of future demand is likely to be for inference – executing trained models at scale to respond to billions of queries. In contrast to training, inference is repetitive, reliable, and very sensitive to costs. This is precisely where custom chips could excel, just as ASICs did for Bitcoin. Related: Will Broadcom Chips End AMD Stock’s AI Dreams? The most compelling indicator emerged last week, when Broadcom announced a $10 billion order for custom AI chips from a singular client, widely thought to be OpenAI. If true, this could imply that OpenAI is relocating a portion of its inference operations away from Nvidia GPUs, likely in pursuit of improved efficiency and reduced costs. Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, has underscored the rise of XPUs or custom accelerators, crafted for specific workloads. These chips could provide hyperscalers with greater control over their infrastructure costs while decreasing reliance on Nvidia’s high-priced GPUs. For OpenAI, whose ChatGPT serves millions of daily users, minor reductions in cost per inference could lead to substantial savings at scale. Having alternatives to Nvidia also enhances bargaining power for GPUs. The attraction of ASICs in both crypto and AI is evident: efficiency, lower energy consumption, and consistent performance for repetitive tasks. For firms operating AI workloads at large scales, these benefits may prove irresistible. However, there are downsides as well. Once produced, the functionality of an ASIC chip is mainly static, in contrast to GPUs which can be reprogrammed or upgraded. Just as Bitcoin ASICs were confined to the SHA-256 algorithm and vulnerable to protocol alterations, AI-specific chips may not possess the flexibility of GPUs. If AI models rapidly advance or architectures evolve, ASICs could become outdated. On the other hand, GPUs remain extremely adaptable, capable of managing both training and inference across diverse models. The design and manufacturing of custom ASICs is also expensive and time-intensive, potentially making them less accessible to smaller firms. For Nvidia, the risk is that its central growth driver – GPUs for AI – may not be as stable as it appears. While training tasks will likely continue to be dominated by GPUs, as the shift toward custom silicon for inference unfolds, Nvidia might experience a decline in demand. Broadcom’s agreement could signify the first step in a larger trend, as hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Meta contemplate similar approaches while additionally developing their own chips. Nvidia still benefits from ecosystem advantages and a comprehensive software platform (CUDA) that assists in better securing customer loyalty. Nonetheless, considering the high valuations and strong momentum, the threat posed by ASICs is one that investors should closely monitor. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably surpassing its benchmarks, which include all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index, providing a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: This new fund from an ex-BlackRock exec is bringing the Wall Street playbook behind music royalties to tech
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/althera42-royalties-based-tech-infrastructure-fund-former-blackrock-exec-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-15T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
Royalties from artists like Fleetwood Mac or Justin Bieber have become big bets for investors. Althera42 wants to copy that playbook for the tech world. The new fund, launched by former BlackRock executive Caspar Macqueen and Christian Czernich, who founded private credit firm Round2 Capital, plans to provide working capital to companies building Europe's digital infrastructure — think data centers and cloud computing — without taking a stake in companies. "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," a factsheet on the new firm published last week states. Focused on late-stage private companies, Althera42's deals will exchange capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues over several years. The money is not a loan, as the manager is not looking to just be paid the initial capital investment plus a fixed interest rate. It is a bet on the revenue growth and scalability of the companies they find, without having to buy in at the sky-high valuations that top startups are demanding for equity. While private credit has been all the rage for years, with more than $260 billion raised in 2025's first quarter alone, according to Pitchbook, Czernich said the royalties model allows the firm to combine the upside of venture capital with the steady cash flow of private debt. The fund will send any gains to investors quarterly, Macqueen said, and charge a 2% management fee and 20% performance fee. The firm's first fund hopes to pull in $300 million and do between 15 and 20 deals, mostly across Europe and the UK, with the potential for some North American investments, said Macqueen, who was the head of BlackRock's UK, Middle East, and Africa for the alternatives business of Aladdin, the firm's widely used risk and analytics platform. The factsheet outlining the fund's plans states that it is seeking companies with between €10 and €100 million in annual revenue (roughly $17 million to $117 million) from "recurring or licensing-based models" that have "defensible IP, low churn, and diversified customer bases." Macqueen imagines most of the money being deployed in France, Germany, Scandinavia, and the UK, and the firm plans to have offices in London, New York, and a still-undecided location in continental Europe, possibly Munich, where Czernich has worked from previously. Other industries, like pharmaceuticals and music, have seen royalties investing come in and out of style over the years. Big names have put capital to work to tap into revenue streams from different industries. Private equity giant KKR purchased a majority stake in healthcare royalties investor HCRx last month, and Blackstone's 2024 purchase of Hipgnosis makes it one of the biggest music royalties investors in the world. However, structuring the deal around future revenues instead of intellectual property is somewhat novel. For Czernich, who has done dozens of private market deals in Europe over his career, royalties investing has the potential for something much bigger than just strong returns for Althera42's investors. "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class," he said. Jump to

Title: Calls for review of east coast railway protection plan

Samantha Libreri Eastern Correspondent Plans aimed at preventing the railway line between south Dublin and Wicklow from falling into the sea in future years could result in major changes along parts of the eastern coastline. Irish Rail wants to place large boulders on a number of beaches and raise sea walls, blocking the view of Dublin Bay on parts of the train journey to try to stop the impact of extreme weather events and coastal erosion on the track, which has already lost lands around it of up to 30 metres over the past decade. But opponents say the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project needs to be reconsidered. Watch: Iarnród Éireann's Cian Lynch on the rail line Iarnród Éireann said the 65km of track that runs from Merrion Gates in south Dublin to Wicklow harbour is vulnerable to the effect of storm surges and climate change. To make the rail more resilient it is planning significant interventions at five locations along the route, which include placing large boulders on a number of beaches along the east coast, including White Rock in Killiney. Project Manager of the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project Cian Lynch said they are proposing the measures to limit disruption of services and to future proof the rail infrastructure. "In recent years, we in Irish Rail have seen more and more occurrences of wave over topping, coastal erosion along this line that necessitates more and more maintenance works, which also results in disruption for services. "As climate change takes hold, that is getting more challenging for us and we do foresee that it will impact services if we don't do something about it now. So several years ago, we took a decision to take a strategic look at this line and to provide more long term permanent protection to coastal erosion and wave over topping, and to factor in climate change as well." The plans include placing large boulders on a number of beaches and raising sea walls in places which will obscure the view of Dublin Bay along parts of the rail journey. Mr Lynch said the measures have been amended in places following an initial public consultation and are being proposed to target particular issues on each of the five locations. "It is quite a scenic and well-known piece of rail infrastructure across the world, and it's very popular for being so close to the sea, that obviously means it is quite exposed. We have just a number of issues at play. "On Killiney beach it's predominantly erosion of the embankments that supports the rail line, further north between Merrion and Seapoint it's wave overtopping and as we head further south towards Wicklow it is more of an erosion issue. So the solutions we're proposing have been adapted to suit the particular locations and to deal with the specific issues in those areas." He said part of the sea walls will be made of glass to allow for a view near some rail stations and that while the size of some beaches may be reduced due to the erection of boulders, access routes to the public will be maintained and improved in some places. 'Compromise' needs to be found However, some believe the plans need to be reconsidered. Fine Gael local representative for Blackrock Cllr Marie Baker said she believes the plans have been over engineered and do not take into account the human impact of the proposed changes. "I fear that it would mean you'll be actually in a DART with your view totally blocked of Dublin Bay and that worries me. I understand they need to secure the line into the future from climate change and storms. We've seen it in the past, unfortunately. But I think what they're proposing seems draconian, to say the least. "A little bit of the crack the nut with a big hammer. I think they need to be more conscious of people's views. I think they need to find a compromise. I can understand that we're going to lose some of our view in Dublin Bay. But do we need to lose it all? I just feel they need to interrogate that a bit more. "I think their proposal is over engineered. I think they need to think about people. There's things there that I don't think have been thought about. I think it would bring lots of sadness to people." Irish Rail said it is eager to receive feedback on the plans as part of its own public consultation which runs until 13 October. A statutory public consultation process will then follow and subject to planning permission, it hopes to begin work, which is estimated to take two to three years by 2029. These five Coastal Cell Areas make up ECRIPP, and are: · CCA1: Merrion to Dún Laoghaire · CCA2-3: Dalkey Tunnel to Shanganagh - Bray Wastewater Treatment Plant · CCA5: Bray Head to Greystones North Beach · CCA6.1: Greystones South to Newcastle · CCA6.2: Newcastle to Wicklow Chief Executive of Iarnród Éireann Jim Meade said: "To provide the best possible solution we want to hear from our neighbours and those that enjoy the coastal amenities along this route and I would urge as many people as possible to give us their feedback". Irish Rail said more details of the plans are available on its website. Eastern Correspondent © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Boutique Investment Bank BDA Cuts Jobs in China on M&A Woes

BDA Partners has cut some investment bankers in Shanghai to cope with intensifying competition in China and uncertainty over deals, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest financial services firm to retreat from the world’s second-biggest economy. Five Shanghai-based investment bankers have been let go by the boutique firm, which focuses on mergers and acquisitions, and a couple have relocated to BDA’s Hong Kong office, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Three senior bankers are staying in Shanghai to work on existing mandates and originating new deals, the people said. BDA may also consider moving to a smaller office to cut costs, although no final decisions have been made, the people said. Founded in 1996 with offices in New York and Singapore, BDA provides Asia-focused M&A advice to global clients, mostly on small-to-mid-sized transactions, its website shows. It also has offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as London. “BDA has been in China since 1999 and we remain strongly committed to M&A across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan,” Simon Kavanagh, BDA’s head of Greater China, wrote in an emailed response to a query from Bloomberg News. “We continue active coverage of China, including having senior bankers on the ground in Hong Kong and the PRC.” While the volume of deals involving Chinese firms has grown this year, there are still plenty of challenges for advisers. They include a tightening of inbound investment, wide valuation gaps between buyers and sellers, cutthroat competition that is squeezing fees, and difficulty in getting deals finished because of geopolitical and regulatory tensions, such as with tariffs. Other investment banks, law firms and investment managers have also downsized in China. Prominent Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP shuttered its Shanghai office last year and laid off staff. Fidelity International also planned to cut jobs in China, while Vanguard Group Inc., Van Eck Associates Corp. and Matthews International Capital Management LLC retreated too. Meanwhile, private equity firm Permira is overhauling its Asia strategy, closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai and shuffling senior leadership to India, where it sees stronger momentum and a more robust pipeline for deals, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year. Other alternative asset managers from KKR & Co. to Blackstone Inc. are also ramping up investments in India and elevating locally based executives to key regional roles. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

BySteve Denning, Senior Contributor. Think the Dow’s 30 powerhouses are all unstoppable money machines? Think again. Some are value-destroying black holes; others are relentless value creators. The data? Ruthless. The takeaway? Crystal clear: Master these three battle-tested value principles or watch your empire crumble. These aren’t isolated hacks—they amplify each other like a chemical reaction. Nail all three? You have a chance to become a permanent value-creator. Botch them? You’re a relic like Boeing or 3M, hemorrhaging returns. Mixed bag? Expect mediocre muddling. The ultimate irony: firms laser-focused on stakeholder value make much more money than firms focused primarily on making money.

Title: Alibaba's $100M Investment Fuels X Square Robot's Push For Embodied AI, Global Sales, And Next-Gen Humanoids

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. X Square Robot, a Shenzhen-based humanoid startup, secured approximately $100 million in funding led by Alibaba Group Holding BABA through Alibaba Cloud in a deal that strengthens the company's expansion in the robotics market. The latest investment brings the startup’s total funding to around $280 million across several financing rounds since launching in December 2023, X Square Robot Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian told CNBC earlier this week. HongShan, formerly Sequoia Capital China, joined the funding round alongside Meituan, Legend Star, Legend Capital, and INCE Capital. Qian confirmed the company is already generating revenue from sales to educational institutions, hospitality venues, and senior care facilities. Don't Miss: Venture capitalists are pouring unprecedented amounts into humanoid robotics as the integration of generative artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize human-machine interactions. X Square Robot exemplifies this trend, having completed eight funding rounds in less than two years of operation. “Right now we need robots to operate and complete complex tasks autonomously,” Yang told CNBC. She emphasized that after decades of developing robots capable of only limited functions like grasping objects, the industry has recognized that AI is essential for expanding machine capabilities. The company on Monday announced WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model, with code linked via GitHub and Hugging Face. The project focuses on vision-language-action alignment for manipulation tasks in real-world settings. Embodied AI here means models that perceive, reason, and act through physical systems such as robots. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. X Square Robot also unveiled its Quanta X2 robot, featuring 360-degree cleaning capabilities with attachable mop heads and advanced hands capable of perceiving subtle pressure changes. According to CNBC, this represents a significant step toward more human-like functionality in commercial robotics applications. Currently, the company’s humanoid robots carry an $80,000 price tag according to research firm Humanoid Guide. Competitor Unitree offers a humanoid model for $16,000, though the advanced capabilities of that unit remain unclear. X Square Robot acknowledged it does not yet have a product ready for mass market delivery, with specific pricing determined by individual use cases, CNBC reported. Yang expects consumer adoption to accelerate once robot prices drop to approximately $10,000, achieved primarily through hardware cost reductions. She projects this milestone is achievable within three to five years, coinciding with the X Square Robot's prediction that “robotic butlers” will become reality within the same timeframe. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It The startup plans to begin preparing for an initial public offering next year, though Yang noted the company has not determined the listing location. X Square Robot is already expanding internationally, with ongoing discussions with potential customers in Japan and Singapore. Yang acknowledged that AI for robotics currently lags behind generative AI advancements in chatting and code generation. She estimates robotic AI technology will require at least 12 months to achieve ChatGPT 3.5-type capabilities, noting that “embodied AI” lacks clear benchmarks for measuring relative progress. While X Square Robot utilizes Nvidia NVDA chips for computing functions, other operations rely on less powerful automotive chips that can be sourced domestically within China, Yang told CNBC. This hybrid approach provides the company with supply chain flexibility as it scales operations to meet growing demand across educational, hospitality, and healthcare sectors.

Title: ROSEN, NATIONAL INVESTOR RIGHTS COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 14, 2025 14:45 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Bitcoin – Not Big Tech – Is The Market’s Biggest Story, Michael Saylor Says

Strategy’s stock and treasury moves have grabbed fresh attention after the company’s executive chairman compared the firm’s returns to those of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech giants. Short and blunt: Strategy has leaned hard into Bitcoin, and recent numbers make a striking case. According to posts by Michael Saylor, Strategy now holds about 638,460 BTC following a purchase of 1,955 BTC at an average price near 111,196. The company has spent roughly $47 billion, fees included, to build that stack at an average buy price of $73,880. Based on reports, the current value of those holdings is about $71 billion. Those figures sit at the center of Saylor’s argument that his firm’s balance sheet strategy has paid off in ways typical tech plays have not. Saylor also shared a chart that matched open interest against market capitalization. Strategy topped that metric at 100%, while Tesla registered 26%. The rest of the Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — came in well below Strategy’s reading. According to his post, this comparison underpins the claim that Strategy’s market dynamics tied to Bitcoin have outpaced many heavyweight tech names. What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7? pic.twitter.com/wywaAij3Rs — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 13, 2025 Based on reports, each of those big tech firms is dealing with different pressures. Apple and Microsoft face tougher regulatory checks. Amazon is seeing slower consumer demand. Tesla must contend with rising competition in electric vehicles. Nvidia remains a strong performer because of AI chip demand, but even Nvidia’s run this year has not matched its earlier explosive gains. Annualized returns presented by Saylor put Strategy at 91%, Nvidia at 72%, Tesla at 32%, Alphabet at 26%, and Meta at 23%. Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon showed significantly lower annualized gains in that comparison. Reports have disclosed that about 12 companies upped their Bitcoin holdings last week, led by Strategy’s 1,955 BTC purchase. Gemini added 1,191 BTC and Bitdeer took on 333.5 BTC. Companies from Japan’s Metaplanet to China’s Cango and the US firm Volcon also added coins. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the 100 largest public holders now control 1,009,202 BTC, which is valued at more than $117 billion today. “What’s your Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7?” Saylor asked on X, hinting that Bitcoin—and his company’s bold treasury bet—may offer the answer. Whether investors see it as a challenge or a warning depends on how they weigh Bitcoin exposure against traditional tech growth.

Posted on September 14, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment Compatibility with WooCommerce has now been expanded to Divi 5, giving you full control over product pages without relying on WooCommerce’s built-in templates. The newly-integrated WooCommerce Product Modules let you design engaging, user-friendly layouts that match your brand and help boost sales, while tapping into all of Divi 5’s features, including Flexbox, to build product pages with modern layout control. In this post, we’ll cover the modules’ key features and show you how to use them for your next Divi 5 ecommerce website. Let’s dive in. Woo Product Modules are specialized content elements within Divi 5, designed to customize product and category pages for Woo-powered stores. These modules replace the WooCommerce templates that come standard with the plugin, enabling you to create customizable layouts. Unlike these traditional templates, Divi 5’s modules allow creative freedom while maintaining compatibility with WooCommerce’s core functionality. The release of 17 WooCommerce Modules in Divi 5 marks a significant milestone. These modules, which cover all product and category page design aspects, are no longer in legacy mode, meaning they are all fully optimized for Divi 5’s modern architecture. With this transition to a more efficient foundation, Divi 5 performs better, is more scalable, and is compatible with the future of WordPress. The remaining 8 Woo Modules, focused on cart and checkout pages, are expected to roll out soon. Let’s go over the key features that you can expect now that the WooCommerce Product Modules have been integrated into Divi 5. The first batch of Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules includes tools designed to handle a specific aspect of product and category page design. These modules are: Together, these modules provide everything you need to build product and category pages, from navigational breadcrumbs to dynamic product displays. Divi 5’s WooCommerce Product Modules free users from the constraints of standard WooCommerce Templates. With these modules, you can fully control your product pages’ layout, structure, and design, creating unique experiences. The modules support dynamic content, meaning they pull product data directly from WooCommerce, ensuring real-time updates for prices, stock levels, and descriptions. This allows you to build pages that drive engagement and conversions without requiring third-party plugins or custom code. Each module has extensive design settings, all manageable within the Visual Builder. You can customize elements like product galleries, sale badges, buttons, and more with options for typography, colors, spacing, and animations. For example, you can adjust the layout of the Woo Product Gallery module to display images in a slider or grid, style the Woo Product Add to Cart button with custom colors and hover effects, or tweak the Woo Product Rating module to align star ratings perfectly with your design. These settings let you create cohesive, branded store pages with ease. Divi 5’s Theme Builder lets you embrace the full potential of WooCommerce Product Modules by allowing you to create global templates for product and category pages. With Theme Builder, you can design a single template that applies to all of the products and categories in your store, ensuring a consistent, cohesive look. The Divi 5 Loop Builder offers an alternative way to build dynamic Woo content. With Loop Builder, you can query WooCommerce products and design flexible product loops using any Divi element, creating layouts, lists, and carousels that go beyond the fixed structure of dedicated product modules. For single-product layouts, use the Woo Product Modules; for product collections and archives, use the Loop Builder. This section will walk you through creating a product page in Divi 5’s Theme Builder using the new WooCommerce Product Modules. Navigate to Divi > Theme Builder in the WordPress dashboard.

India's CSR regime, a significant source of social funding, has primarily focused on education, health, and rural development. However, it overlooks policy research, crucial for achieving true self-reliance. Increased CSR investment in think tanks and R&D could boost innovation, competitiveness, and effective governance, strengthening India's intellectual sovereignty and supporting national priorities.

Title: TSM-Bee? TSMC gets into the honey business after working with local beekeepers to establish hives around its fabs
URL: https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsm-bee-tsmc-gets-into-the-honey-business-after-working-with-local-beekeepers-to-establish-hives-around-its-fabs

TSMC branded honey is available in several flavors, depending on the flora around a particular fab. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TSMC has worked with local beekeepers in Taiwan to produce ‘Ji Mi’ – TSMC branded honey. The production of this golden, viscous, and culinary important liquid has become possible around the world’s largest contract chipmaker fabs in Taiwan thanks to extensive environmental and sustainability efforts by the company. Sources: Liberty Times and Mirror Daily (machine translated). On Friday, TSMC presented at the ‘2025 Asia Pacific Sustainability Expo - Co-Prosperity x Growth Forum.’ At the event, its SVP of Corporate Sustainability, Ho Li-mei, claimed TSMC's commitment to ecological integration has reaped very worthwhile, and some surprising, dividends. The prime example, as per our headline, is that bees have returned to the local ecosystem around TSMC’s massive manufacturing facilities. Bees came naturally after the restoration of plant species chosen for their suitability, after environmental surveys. Now TSMC is collaborating with local beekeepers and Tunghai University to produce TSMC-exclusive honey – ‘Ji Mi.’ Other signs that nature’s balance has been restored around TSMC fabs are the return of native Taiwanese species like the silver goby in waters around the plants. It is also claimed that TSMC is the first semiconductor producer in Taiwan to have fireflies living on the site. Fireflies are notoriously fussy about the environments they inhabit in Taiwan. Tom’s Hardware regulars will be aware of TSMC’s previous concerns about water supplies. This resource pressure, and the need for TSMC to be particularly eco-friendly, given Taiwan’s rather small size, may have been instrumental to the surprising eco-dividends we are now seeing around its fabs. At the Expo, Ho Li-mei mentioned that TSMC has made major inroads in managing precious resources in the water-intensive semiconductor industry. Thanks to specialized resource management, water recycling at new facilities has been increased to over 90%, it is claimed. As resources are carefully conserved, semiconductor manufacturing waste is being reduced to the minimum. The source reports note that TSMC's waste recycling rate is as high as 97%, and less than 1% of waste in Taiwan is landfilled. Moreover, a modern ‘Zero Waste Center’ in Taichung has been successful at converting waste into electronic-grade raw materials – advancing the circular economy.

Defence stocks surged Rs 43,000 crore on Friday, lifting the Nifty Defence index to an eight-week high. Gains were driven by new submarine orders, a 15-year MoD modernisation roadmap, and strong order books.

Title: Goldman Sachs Warns An AI Slowdown Can Tank The Stock Market By 20%

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to all-time highs, but Goldman Sachs GS recently warned that once AI spending slows down, the stock market can tank by 20%. A research note from Goldman Sachs Analyst Ryan Hammond cited the danger of hyperscalers inevitably cutting back on AI expenditures, according to Fortune. "A reversion of long-term growth estimates back to early 2023 levels would imply 15% to 20% downside to the current valuation multiple of the S&P 500," Hammond reportedly wrote in his research note. Don't Miss: Right now, AI spending is full steam ahead, but Hammond wrote that a few analysts are assuming that a sharp deceleration will take place in Q4 2025 and 2026. Tech giants haven't gotten the memo. Meta Platforms META said this week it will spend $600 billion on AI over the next three years. Zuckerberg later posted on Threads that it's possible the company will invest more than $600 billion during those three years. He even said a "significantly higher number" was likely through the end of the decade. Microsoft MSFT made another big AI deal this week by securing a five-year, $17.4 billion AI infrastructure deal with Nebius NBIS. This type of rapid spending indicates AI growth can continue beyond the current rally.

Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in the stock market's performance based on the top companies in major benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Data from Slickchart shows that top AI beneficiary Nvidia NVDA makes up approximately 7% of the S&P 500. The top eight publicly traded corporations on the S&P 500 are all heavily invested in artificial intelligence. They are ramping up their AI spending and aim to release products and services that use AI. These eight companies make up more than 36% of the S&P 500. There are also corporate giants outside of the S&P 500's top 10 that still invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Oracle ORCL, Palantir PLTR, and Cisco CSCO are some of the most notable S&P 500 members in the category. Those three stocks make up more than 2% of the S&P 500 combined, and if they continue to outpace stocks with less of a focus on AI, then the technology's influence on the stock market will continue to grow. If the AI trade fades, many stocks will lose value and drag the S&P 500 considerably lower from its current levels.

However, Hammond reportedly brings up a point that some investors are ignoring. What if AI spending eventually slows down? There's only so much money and profits big tech can spend on AI, so growth rates will eventually have to decrease. It can still take a few years before a meaningful slowdown in the growth of AI spending, and decelerating growth rates don't necessarily translate into big tech pulling out of AI spending completely. Investors should consider the bullish and bearish points of any of their positions. While the stock market is exuberant on AI and its long-term potential, it's good to consider the possible downside of any slowdowns in AI spending.

Title: AI Will Not Make You Rich

Fortunes are made by entrepreneurs and investors when revolutionary technologies enable waves of innovative, investable companies. Think of the railroad, the Bessemer process, electric power, the internal combustion engine, or the microprocessor—each of which, like a stray spark in a fireworks factory, set off decades of follow-on innovations, permeated every part of society, and catapulted a new set of inventors and investors into power, influence, and wealth. Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen’s race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running. Anyone who invests in the new new thing must answer two questions: First, how much value will this innovation create? And second, who will capture it? Information and communication technology (ICT) was a revolution whose value was captured by startups and led to thousands of newly rich founders, employees, and investors. In contrast, shipping containerization was a revolution whose value was spread so thin that in the end, it made only a single founder temporarily rich and only a single investor a little bit richer. Is generative AI more like the former or the latter? Will it be the basis of many future industrial fortunes, or a net loser for the investment community as a whole, with a few zero-sum winners here and there? There are ways to make money investing in the fruits of AI, but they will depend on assuming the latter—that it is once again a less propitious time for inventors and investors, that AI model builders and application companies will eventually compete each other into an oligopoly, and that the gains from AI will accrue not to its builders but to customers. A lot of the money pouring into AI is therefore being invested in the wrong places, and aside from a couple of lucky early investors, those who make money will be the ones with the foresight to get out early. The microprocessor was revolutionary, but the people who invented it at Intel in 1971 did not see it that way—they just wanted to avoid designing desktop calculator chipsets from scratch every time. But outsiders realized they could use the microprocessor to build their own personal computers, and enthusiasts did. Thousands of tinkerers found configurations and uses that Intel never dreamed of. This distributed and permissionless invention kicked off a “great surge of development,” as the economist Carlota Perez calls it, triggered by technology but driven by economic and societal forces.[1] There was no real demand for personal computers in the early 1970s; they were expensive toys. But the experimenters laid the technical groundwork and built a community. Then, around 1975, a step-change in the cost of microprocessors made the personal computer market viable. The Intel 8080 had an initial list price of $360 ($2,300 in today’s dollars). MITS could barely turn a profit on its Altair at a bulk price of $75 each ($490 today). But when MOS Technologies started selling its 6502 for $25 ($150 today), Steve Wozniak could afford to build a prototype Apple. The 6502 and the similarly priced Zilog Z80 forced Intel’s prices down. The nascent PC community started spawning entrepreneurs and a score of companies appeared, each with a slightly different product. You couldn’t have known in the mid-1970s that the PC (and PC-like products, such as ATMs, POS terminals, smartphones, etc.) would revolutionize everything. While Steve Jobs was telling investors that every household would someday have a personal computer (a wild underestimate, as it turned out), others questioned the need for personal computers at all. As late as 1979, Apple’s ads didn’t tell you what a personal computer could do—it asked what you did with it.[2] The established computer manufacturers (IBM, HP, DEC) had no interest in a product their customers weren’t asking for. Nobody “needed” a computer, and so PCs weren’t bought—they were sold. Flashy startups like Apple and Sinclair used hype to get noticed, while companies with footholds in consumer electronics like Atari, Commodore, and Tandy/RadioShack used strong retail connections to put their PCs in front of potential customers. The market grew slowly at first, accelerating only as experiments led to practical applications like the spreadsheet, introduced in 1979. As use grew, observation of use caused a reduction in uncertainty, leading to more adoption in a self-reinforcing cycle. This kind of gathering momentum takes time in every technological wave: It took almost 30 years for electricity to reach half of American households, for example, and it took about the same amount of time for personal computers.[3] When a technological revolution changes everything, it takes a huge amount of innovation, investment, storytelling, time, and plain old work. It also sucks up all the money and talent available. Like Kuhn’s paradigms in science, any technology not part of the wave’s techno-economic paradigm will seem like a sideshow.[4] Source: [3] The nascent growth of PCs attracted investors—venture capitalists—who started making risky bets on new companies. This development incentivized more inventors, entrepreneurs, and researchers, which in turn drew in more speculative capital. Companies like IBM, the computing behemoth before the PC, saw poor relative performance. They didn’t believe the PC could survive long enough to become capable in their market and didn’t care about new, small markets that wanted a cheaper solution. Retroactively, we give the PC pioneers the powers of prophets rather than visionaries. But at the time, nobody outside of a small group of early adopters paid any attention. Establishment media like The New York Times didn’t take the PC seriously until after IBM’s was introduced in August 1981. In the entire year of 1976, when Apple Computer was founded, the NYT mentioned PCs only four times.[5] Apparently, only the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, and the troublemakers were paying attention. Source: [5] It’s the element of surprise that should strike us most forcefully when we compare the early days of the computer revolution to today. No one took note of personal computers in the 1970s. In 2025, AI is all we seem to talk about. Big companies hate surprises. That’s why uncertainty makes a perfect moat for startups. Apple would never have survived IBM entering the market in 1979, and only lived to compete another day after raising $100 million in its 1980 IPO. It was the only remaining competitor after the IBM-induced winnowing.[6] Source: [6] As the tech took hold and started to show promise, innovations in software, memory, and peripherals like floppy disk drives and modems joined it. They reinforced one another, with each advance putting pressure on the technologies adjacent to it. When any part of the system held back the other parts, investors rushed to fund that sector. As increases in PC memory allowed more complicated software, for example, there became a need for more external storage, which caused VC Dave Marquardt to invest in disk drive manufacturer Seagate in 1980. Seagate gave Marquardt a 40x return when it went public in 1981. Other investors noticed, and some $270 million was plowed into the industry in the following three years.[7] Money also poured into the underlying infrastructure—fiber optic networks, chip making, etc.—so that capacity was never a bottleneck. Companies which used the new technological system to outperform incumbents began to take market share, and even staid competitors realized they needed to adopt the new thing or die. The hype became a froth which became an investment bubble: the dot-com frenzy of the late 1990s. The ICT wave was therefore similar to previous ones—like the investment mania of the 1830s and the Roaring ‘20s, which followed the infrastructure buildout of canals and railways, respectively—in which the human response to each stage predictably generated the next. When the dot-com bubble popped, society found it disapproved of the excesses in the sector and governments found they had the popular support to reassert authority over the tech companies and their investors. This put a brake on the madness. Instead of the reckless innovation of the bubble, companies started to expand into proven markets, and financiers moved from speculating to investing. Entrepreneurs began to focus on finding applications rather than on innovating the underlying technologies. Technological improvements continued, but change became more evolutionary than revolutionary. As change slowed, companies gained the confidence to invest for the longer term. They began to combine various parts of the system in new ways to create value for a wider group of users. The massive overbuilding of fiber optic telecom networks and other infrastructure during the frenzy left plenty of cheap capacity, keeping the costs of expansion down. It was a great time to be a businessperson and investor. In contrast, society did not need a bubble to pop to start excoriating AI. Given that the backlash to tech has been going on for a decade, this seems normal to us. But the AI backlash differs from the general high regard, earlier in the cycle, enjoyed by the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and others who built big tech businesses. The world hates change, and only gave tech a pass in the ‘80s and ‘90s because it all still seemed reversible: it could be made to go away if it turned out badly. This gave the early computer innovators some leeway to experiment. Now that everyone knows computers are here to stay, AI is not allowed the same wait-and-see attitude. It is seen as part of the ICT revolution. Perez, the economist, breaks each technological wave into four predictable phases: irruption, frenzy, synergy, and maturity. Each has a characteristic investment profile. The middle two, frenzy and synergy, are the easy ones for investors. Frenzy is when everyone piles in and investors are rewarded for taking big risks on unproven ideas, culminating in the bubble, when paper profits disappear. When rationality returns, the synergy phase begins, as companies make their products usable and productive for a wide array of users. Synergy pays those who are patient, picky, and can bring more than just money to the table. Irruption and maturity are more difficult to invest in. Investing in the 1970s was harder than it might look in hindsight. To invest from 1971 through 1975, you had to be either a true believer or a conglomerator with a knuckle-headed diversification strategy. Intel was a great investment, though it looked at first like a previous-wave electronics company. MOS Technologies was founded in 1969 to compete with Texas Instruments but sold a majority of itself to Allen-Bradley to stay afloat. Zilog was funded in 1975 by Exxon (Exxon!). Apple was a great investment, but it had none of the hallmarks of what VCs look for, as the PC was still a solution in search of a problem. It was later irruption, in the early 1980s, when great opportunities proliferated: PC makers (Compaq, Dell), software and operating systems (Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Adobe), peripherals (Seagate), workstations (Sun), and computer stores (Businessland), among others. If you invested in the winners, you did well. But there was still more money than ideas, which meant that it was no golden age for investing. By 1983, there were more than 70 companies competing in the disk drive sector alone, and valuations collapsed. There were plenty of people whose fortunes were established in the 1970s and 1980s, and many VCs made their names in that era. But the biggest advantage to being an irruption-stage investor was building institutional knowledge to invest early and well in the frenzy and synergy phases. Investing in the maturity phase is even more difficult. In irruption, it’s hard to see what will happen; in maturity, nothing much happens at all. The uncertainty about what will work and how customers and society will react is almost gone. Things are predictable, and everyone acts predictably. The lack of dynamism allows the successful synergy companies to remain entrenched (see: the Nifty 50 and FAANG), but growth becomes harder. They start to enter each other’s markets, conglomerate, raise prices, and cut costs. The era of products priced to entice new customers ends, and quality suffers. The big companies continue to embrace the idea of revolutionary innovation, but feel the need to control how their advances are used. R&D spending is redirected from product and process innovation toward increasingly fruitless attempts to find ways to extend the current paradigm. Companies frame this as a drive to win, but it’s really a fear of losing. Innovation can happen during maturity, sometimes spectacularly. But because these innovations only find support if they fit into the current wave’s paradigm, they are easily captured in the dominant companies’ gravity wells. This means making money as an entrepreneur or investor in them is almost impossible. Generative AI is clearly being captured by the dominant ICT companies, which raises the question of whether this time will be different for inventors and investors—a different question from whether AI itself is a revolutionary technology. Shipping containerization was a late-wave innovation that changed the world, kicked off our modern era of globalization, resulted in profound changes to society and the economy, and contributed to rapid growth in well-being. But there were, perhaps, only one or two people who made real money investing in it. The year 1956 was late in the previous wave. But that year, the company soon to be known as SeaLand revolutionized freight shipping with the launch of the first containership, the Ideal-X. SeaLand’s founder, Malcom McLean, had an epiphany that the job to be done by truckers, railroads, and shipping lines was to move goods from shipper to destination, not to drive trucks, fill boxcars, or lade boats. SeaLand allowed freight to transfer seamlessly from one mode to another, saving time, making shipping more predictable, and cutting costs—both the costs of loading, unloading, and reloading, and the cost of a ship sitting idly in port as it was loaded and unloaded.[8] The benefits of containerization, if it could be made to happen, were obvious. Everybody could see the efficiencies, and customers don’t care how something gets to where they can buy it, as long as it does. But longshoremen would lose work, politicians would lose the votes of those who lost work, port authorities would lose the support of the politicians, federal regulators would be blamed for adverse consequences, railroads might lose freight to shipping lines, shipping lines might lose freight to new shipping lines, and it would all cost a mint. Most thought McLean would never be able to make it work. McLean squeezed through the cracks of the opposition he faced. He bought and retrofitted war surplus ships, lowering costs. He went after the coastal shipping trade, a dying business in the age of the new interstates, to avoid competition. He set up shop in Newark, NJ, rather than the shipping hub of Hell’s Kitchen, to get buy-in from the port authority and avoid Manhattan congestion. And he made a deal with the New York longshoremen’s union, which was only possible because he was a small player whom they figured was not a threat. Source: [10] But competitors and regulators moved too quickly for McLean to seize the few barriers to entry that might have been available to him: domination of the ports, exclusive agreements with shippers or other forms of transportation, standardization on proprietary technology, etc.[9] When it started to look like it might work, around 1965, the obvious advantages of containerization meant that every large shipping line entered the business, and competition took off. Even though containerized freight was less than 1% of total trade by 1968, the number of containerships was already ramping fast.[10] Capacity outstripped demand for years. The increase in competition led to a rate war, which led to squeezed profits, which in turn led to consolidation and cartels. Meanwhile, the cost of building ever-larger container ships and the port facilities to deal with them meant the business became hugely capital intensive. McLean saw the writing on the wall and sold SeaLand to R.J. Reynolds in January 1969. He was, perhaps, the only entrepreneur to get out unscathed. It took a long time for the end-to-end vision to be realized. But around 1980, a dramatic drop began in the cost of sea freight.[11] This contributed to a boom in international trade[12] and allowed manufacturers to move away from higher-wage to lower-wage countries, making containerization irreversible. Source: [11] Some people did make money, of course; someone always does. McLean did, as did shipping magnate Daniel Ludwig, who had invested $8.5 million in SeaLand’s predecessor, McLean Industries, at $8.50 per share in 1965 and sold in 1969 for $50 per share.[13] Shipbuilders made money, too: between 1967 and 1972, some $10 billion ($80 billion in 2025 dollars) was spent building containerships. The contractors that built the new container ports also made money. And, later, shipping lines that consolidated and dominated the business, like Maersk and Evergreen, became very large. But, “for R.J. Reynolds, and for other companies that had chased fast growth by buying into container shipping in the late 1960s, their investments brought little but disappointment.”[14] Aside from McLean and Ludwig, it is hard to find anyone who became rich from containerization itself, because competition and capex costs made it hard to grow fast or achieve high margins. Source: [12] The business ended up being dominated primarily by the previous incumbents, and the margins went to the companies shipping goods, not the ones they shipped through. Companies like IKEA benefited from cheap shipping, going from a provincial Scandinavian company in 1972 to the world’s largest furniture retailer by 2008; container shipping was a perfect fit for IKEA’s flat-pack furniture. Others, like Walmart, used the predictability enabled by containerization to lower inventory and its associated costs. With hindsight, it’s easy to see how you could have invested in containerization: not in the container shipping industry itself, but in the industries that benefited from containerization. But even here, the success of companies like Walmart, Costco, and Target was coupled with the failure of others. The fallout from containerization set Sears and Woolworth on downward spirals, put the final nail in the coffin of Montgomery Ward and A&P, and drove Macy’s into bankruptcy before it was rescued and downsized by Federated. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, “the furniture capital of the world,” furniture makers tried to compete with IKEA by importing cheap pieces from China. They ended up being replaced by their suppliers.[15] If there had been more time to build moats, there might have been a few dominant containerization companies, and the people behind them would be at the top of the Forbes 400, while their investors would be legendary. But moats take time to build and, unlike the personal computer, the adoption of containerization wasn’t a surprise—every business with interests at stake had a strategic plan immediately. The economist Joseph Schumpeter said “perfect competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever anything new is being introduced.”[16] But containerization shows this isn’t true at the end of tech waves. And because there is no economic profit during perfect competition, there is no money to be made by innovators during maturity. Like containerization, the introduction of AI did not lead to a period of protected profits for its innovators. It led to an immediate competitive free-for-all. Let’s grant that generative AI is revolutionary (but also that, as is becoming increasingly clear, this particular tech is now already in an evolutionary stage). It will create a lot of value for the economy, and investors hope to capture some of it. When, who, and how depends on whether AI is the end of the ICT wave, or the beginning of a new one. If AI had started a new wave, there would have been an extended period of uncertainty and experimentation. There would have been a population of early adopters experimenting with their own models. When thousands or millions of tinkerers use the tech to solve problems in entirely new ways, its uses proliferate. But because they are using models owned by the big AI companies, their ability to fully experiment is limited to what’s allowed by the incumbents, who have no desire to permit an extended challenge to the status quo. This doesn’t mean AI can’t start the next technological revolution. It might, if experimentation becomes cheap, distributed and permissionless—like Wozniak cobbling together computers in his garage, Ford building his first internal combustion engine in his kitchen, or Trevithick building his high-pressure steam engine as soon as James Watt’s patents expired. When any would-be innovator can build and train an LLM on their laptop and put it to use in any way their imagination dictates, it might be the seed of the next big set of changes—something revolutionary rather than evolutionary. But until and unless that happens, there can be no irruption. AI is instead the epitome of the ICT wave. The computing visionaries of the 1960s set out to build a machine that could think, which their successors eventually did, by extending gains in algorithms, chips, data, and data center infrastructure. Like containerization, AI is an extension of something that came before, and therefore no one is surprised by what it can and will do. In the 1970s, it took time for people to wrap their heads around the desirability of powerful and ubiquitous computing. But in 2025, machines that think better than previous machines are easy for people to understand. Consider the extent to which the progress of AI rhymes with the business evolution of containerization: In the “AI rhymes” column, the first four items are already underway. How you should invest depends on whether you believe Nos. 5–7 are next. Economists are predicting that AI will increase global GDP somewhere between 1%[17] to more than 7%[18] over the next decade, which is $1–7 trillion of new value created. The big question is where that money will stick as it flows through the value chain. Most AI market overviews have a score or more categories, breaking each of them into customer and industry served. But these will change dramatically over the next few years. You could, instead, just follow the money to simplify the taxonomy of companies: What the history of containerization suggests is that, if you aren’t already an investor in a model company, you shouldn’t bother. Sam Altman and a few other early movers may make a fortune, as McLean and Ludwig did. But the huge costs of building and running a model, coupled with intense competition, means there will, in the end, be only a few companies, each funded and owned by the largest tech companies. If you’re already an investor, congratulations: There will be consolidation, so you might get an exit. Domain-specific models—like Cursor or Harvey—will be part of the consolidation. These are probably the most valuable models. But fine-tuning is relatively cheap, and there are big economies of scope. On the other hand, just as Google had to buy Invite Media in 2010 to figure out how to sell to ad agencies, domain-specific model companies that have earned the trust of their customers will be prime acquisition targets. And although it seems possible that models which generate things other than language—like Midjourney or Runway—might use their somewhat different architecture to carve out a separate technological path, the LLM companies have easily entered this space as well. Whether this applies to companies like Osmo remains to be seen. While it’s too late to invest in the model companies, the profusion of those using the models to solve specific problems is ongoing: Perplexity, InflectionAI, Writer, Abridge, and a hundred others. But if any of these become very valuable, the model companies will take their earnings, either through discriminatory pricing or vertical integration. Success, in other words, will mean defeat—always a bad thesis. At some point, model companies and app companies will converge: There will simply be AI companies, and only a few of them. There will be some winners, as always, but investments in the app layer as a whole will lose money. The same caveat applies, however: If an app company can build a customer base or an amazing team, it might be acquired. But these companies aren’t really technology companies at all; they are building a market on spec and have to be priced as such. A further caveat is that there will be investors who make a killing arbitraging FOMO-panicked acquirors willing to massively overpay. But this is not really “investing.” There might be an investment opportunity in companies that manage the interface between the AI giants and their customers, or protect company data from the model companies—like Hugging Face or Glean—because these businesses are by nature independent of the models. But no analogue in the post-containerization shipping market became very large. Even the successful intermediation companies in the AI space will likely end up mid-sized because the model companies will not allow them to gain strategic leverage—another consequence of the absence of surprise. When an industry is going to be big but there is uncertainty about how it will play out, it often makes sense to swim upstream to the industry’s suppliers. In the case of AI, this means the chip providers, data companies, and cloud/data center companies: SambaNova, Scale AI, and Lambda, as well as those that have been around for a long time, like Nvidia and Bloomberg. The case for data is mixed. General data—i.e., things most people know, including everything anyone knew more than, say, 10 years ago, and most of what was learned after that—is a commodity. There may be room for a few companies to do the grunt work of collating and tagging it, but since the collating and tagging might best be done by AI itself, there will not be a lot of pricing leverage. Domain-specific models will need specialist data, and other models will try to answer questions about the current moment. Specific, timely, and hard to reproduce data will be valuable. This is not a new market, of course—Bloomberg and others have done well by it. A more concentrated customer base will lower prices for this data, while wider use will raise revenues. On balance, this will probably be a plus for the industry, though not a huge one. There will be new companies built, but only a couple worth investing in. The high capex of AI companies will primarily be spent with the infrastructure companies. These companies are already valued with this expectation, so there won’t be an upside surprise. But consider that shipbuilding benefited from containerization from 1965 until demand collapsed after about 1973.[19] If AI companies consolidate or otherwise act in concert, even a slight downturn that forces them to conserve cash could turn into a serious, sudden, and long-lasting decline in infrastructure spending. This would leave companies like Nvidia and its emerging competitors—who must all make long-term commitments to suppliers and for capacity expansion—unable to lower costs to match the new, smaller market size. Companies priced for an s-curve are overpriced if there’s a peak and decline. Source: [19] All of which means that investors shouldn’t swim upstream, but fish downstream: companies whose products rely on achieving high-quality results from somewhat ambiguous information will see increased productivity and higher profits. These sectors include professional services, healthcare, education, financial services, and creative services, which together account for between a third and a half of global GDP and have not seen much increased productivity from automation. AI can help lower costs, but as with containerization, how individual businesses incorporate lower costs into their strategies—and what they decide to do with the savings—will determine success. To put it bluntly, using cost savings to increase profits rather than grow revenue is a loser’s game. The companies that will benefit most rapidly are those whose strategies are already conditional on lowering costs. IKEA’s longtime strategy was to sell quality furniture for low prices and make it up on volume. After containerization made it possible for them to go worldwide, IKEA became the world’s largest retailer and Ingvar Kamprad (the IK of IKEA) became a billionaire. Similarly, Walmart, whose strategy was high volume and low prices in underserved markets, benefited from both cost savings and just-in-time supply chains, allowing increased product variety and lower inventory costs. Today’s knowledge-work companies that already prioritize the same values are the least risky way to bet on AI, but new companies will form or re-form with a high-volume, low-cost strategy, just as Costco did in the early 1980s. New companies will compete with the incumbents, but with a clean slate and hindsight. Regardless, there are few barriers to entry, so each of these firms will face stiff competition and operate in fragmented markets. Experienced management and flawless execution will be key. Being an entrepreneur will be a fabulous proposition in these sectors. Being an investor will be harder. Companies will not need much private capital—IKEA never needed to raise risk capital, and Costco raised only one round in 1983 before going public in 1985—because implementing cost-savings technology is not capital intensive. As with containerization, there will be a long lag between technology trigger and the best investments. The opportunities will be later. Stock pickers will also make money, but they need to be choosy. At the high end of projections, an additional 7% in GDP growth over ten years within one third of the economy gives a tailwind of only about 2% per year to these companies—even less if productivity growth from older ICT products abates. The primary value shift will be to companies that are embracing the strategic implications of AI from companies that are not, the way Walmart benefited from Sears, which took advantage of cheaper goods prices but did not reinvent itself. Consumers, however, will be the biggest beneficiaries. Previous waves of mechanization benefited labor productivity in manufacturing, driving prices down and saving consumers money. But increased labor productivity in manufacturing also led to higher manufacturing wages. Wages in services businesses had to rise to compete, even though these businesses did not benefit from productivity gains. This caused the price of services to rise.[20] The share of household spending on food and clothing went from 55% in 1918 to 16% in 2023,[21] but the cost of knowledge-intensive services like healthcare and education have grown well above inflation. Something similar will happen with AI: Knowledge-intensive services will get cheaper, allowing consumers to buy more of them, while services that require person-to-person interaction will get more expensive, taking up a greater percentage of household spending. This points to obvious opportunities in both. But the big news is that most of the new value created by AI will be captured by consumers, who should see a wider variety of knowledge-intensive goods at reasonable prices, and wider and more affordable access to services like medical care, education, and advice. There is nothing better than the beginning of a new wave, when the opportunities to envision, invent, and build world-changing companies leads to money, fame, and glory. But there is nothing more dangerous for investors and entrepreneurs than wishful thinking. The lessons learned from investing in tech over the last 50 years are not the right ones to apply now. The way to invest in AI is to think through the implications of knowledge workers becoming more efficient, to imagine what markets this efficiency unlocks, and to invest in those. For decades, the way to make money was to bet on what the new thing was. Now, you have to bet on the opportunities it opens up.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Financial markets have already had an unusual year, but recent price action lately has been especially bizarre, according to Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a Substack post on Tuesday titled “Super weird markets since Jackson Hole,” he traced the path of key assets since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to rate cuts in a speech at the annual central bank symposium last month. “You’d have thought that would weigh on the Dollar, lift the S&P 500 and boost commodity prices across the board. But that hasn’t happened,” Brooks wrote. “The only thing that’s moved is gold, with a massive price rise of almost 10 percent.” To be sure, stocks have rallied since his post as benign inflation data cleared the way for Fed rate cuts when policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices have also marched higher, setting fresh highs along the way and closing Friday at $3,680.70 per ounce. But the bond market has behaved more unexpectedly. Brooks noted the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall right after Powell’s speech but only turned lower after another bad jobs report was released two weeks later. “The fact that the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall immediately is weird and worrying,” he added. “It took very weak payrolls to finally do that.” In addition, while the dollar index has had some ups and downs, it has returned to about where it was before Powell’s speech, with Brooks calling that “counterintuitive” as expectations for Fed easing would typically bring it lower. Meanwhile, bitcoin sold off after Jackson Hole but is also back where it started, even though cryptocurrencies have generally acted like risk assets in the past and previously rallied on rate-cut hopes. “What does all this mean? Recent market moves suggest gold is the ultimate safe haven,” Brooks said. “Bitcoin is proving too volatile and speculative, so — as political pressure on the Fed mounts — markets gravitate to gold.” Fears of a debt crisis in France and the U.K. have jolted global bond yields higher in recent weeks. Political gridlock in France in particular has dimmed hopes that Paris will rein in deficits anytime soon. On Friday evening, Fitch downgraded France’s credit rating from AA- to A+, the lowest level ever for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, saying a major shift to fiscal discipline is unlikely. It’s possible the crisis in France sent more investors looking for a safe haven toward the dollar, potentially explaining why the greenback has been stable, Brooks said. After his post, other global events have stirred more geopolitical concerns that may also favor the dollar. Israel attacked Hamas leaders in Qatar, a close U.S. Mideast ally, sparking sharp backlash in the region and sending oil prices higher. And Russian drones entered Polish airspace, forcing NATO allies to activate air-defense systems and deploy fighters jets that shot down the aircraft. “The bottom line is that there’s a lot of things in markets that don’t currently hang together well at all,” Brooks said. The key question is whether the rise in gold prices is sign that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status, though he thinks it’s just temporary noise and sees a reversion to the mean eventually. In a note on Tuesday, Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, also noticed the odd market moves that have been going on. But he said “the tell” is the dollar’s 10% decline year to date against other global currencies, which stems from President Donald Trump’s efforts to weaken Fed independence, worsen deficits, and reorder the global trading system. “When you take all that into account, those market moves suddenly start to make a lot more sense,” Brown added. “Yes, the correlations are unusual. But, so is the macroeconomic environment, and so are the policy choices that continue to be made, as government spending runs away with itself across DM, rate cuts resume stateside, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside, and a potential economic re-acceleration looms now the initial trade/tariff uncertainty has (largely) been navigated.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person on Wednesday, as Oracle’s stock surged due to enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. Why it matters: The tight race between Musk and Ellison highlights the immense wealth generated by the tech industry and the growing importance of AI in driving stock valuations. The details: Since the beginning of the year, Ellison’s position in Bloomberg’s ranking has seen a significant increase, with a $191 billion boost as of Wednesday’s close, while Musk has experienced a $48 billion decline. What’s next: The race for the world’s richest person title may continue to fluctuate, depending on the performance of Oracle and Tesla shares in the coming days and weeks. #LarryEllison has just become the richest man in the world.

Title: Stocks Reach Highs On Oracle And Fed Expectations

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high last Thursday but declined fractionally on Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed with Oracle’s (ORCL) earnings further reinforcing the artificial intelligence (AI) growth narrative. Notably, banks performed well, which hints that the market is expecting a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut next week and a resilient economy. All signs point to artificial intelligence as being a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Indications suggest that the adoption of artificial intelligence is continuing at a rapid pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. This spending has created a virtuous cycle of spending and earnings for several mega-cap technology companies, including many of the Magnificent 7, which have seen their earnings and valuations flourish. While not included in the Magnificent 7, Oracle (ORCL) has quietly become a beneficiary of the seemingly insatiable current demand for AI training and the emerging demand for AI inferencing. Oracle’s management believes that its architecture enables better AI training at a lower cost for clients, providing a competitive edge. Additionally, their legacy database business enables Oracle’s clients to utilize their own data to offer AI inferencing, producing actionable insights, decisions, and predictions. AI inferencing is the crucial next step to AI demand and growth, since it is the use case for AI and expands the potential demand base to all corporations. Last week, Oracle announced a remaining performance obligation (RPO) of $455.3 billion, which can be thought of as an order backlog or contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been fulfilled. Oracle’s RPO grew by $317.5 billion quarter-over-quarter from AI-related contracts. This growth in RPO stems from multi-year contracts, so this revenue will likely be realized over a roughly seven-year period. In any case, analysts’ estimates now expect Oracle’s revenue growth to accelerate from 8.4% year-over-year for fiscal 2025 to 21.9% in 2027. While the exact margins and thus profits on this new business remain unknown, the apparent demand for their services sent the stock soaring by 25.5% last week. The supportive news from Oracle fueled the continued rally in many AI-related technology companies, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA) outperforming the S&P 500 handily last week. The August employment report saw payrolls grow by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Additionally, Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. Since then, on September 9, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released preliminary revisions to payroll data, showing that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the twelve months through March 2025 than were initially reported. This record-breaking downward revision roughly halved the job growth estimate from previous projections. According to recent data, the four-week average of initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to near a year-to-date high. While the absolute level of initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits looks benign, the trend is moving higher. Continuing claims for benefits are also above the lows, indicating a slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. While the four-week average of initial claims for benefits is typically used to remove the volatility, the weekly claims were the highest in over three years. Consensus estimates suggest that the weekly claims will revert to roughly the four-week average level this week, as the spike last week was primarily due to filings in Texas. Following the weaker jobs data, a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting is a virtual certainty. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut this week. Beyond the cut this week, markets expect an additional two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts for the remainder of 2025. Bottom line: The September rate cut is widely expected, so that the focus will shift to expectations for future cuts. The Fed’s release of its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with Chair Powell’s comments, will be closely scrutinized for clues as to the expected pace of lower short-term rates. There are only five companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with FedEx (FDX) as the most notable for economic insights. August retail sales are scheduled for Wednesday. The US consumer has remained resilient, which is crucial for economic growth expectations, as consumer spending is the primary driver. Expectations are for some moderation from last month’s pace, but the data will be watched for signs that tariffs or the softening job market might be weighing on spending. Stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of banks and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. Further, the implied expectation is that the Fed will cut interest rates aggressively enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. While there are signs of deterioration in the labor market, there remains little evidence of an impending recession, and tech spending around AI is supporting rapid earnings growth in that sector. While the Fed will almost certainly cut rates this week, the implied future pace of easing might be slower than markets would like, which could result in increased stock volatility.

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."

Title: Estimating MicroStrategy’s Timeline to 1 Million Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/09/12/estimating-microstrategys-timeline-to-1-million-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T20:53:34Z
Full Content:
Current Bitcoin Holdings of MicroStrategy MicroStrategy (now rebranded as Strategy Inc. as of early 2025) is the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As of September 2025, the company holds approximately 638,460 BTC in its treasury . This massive stash – roughly 3% of all bitcoins that will ever exist – reflects an aggressive accumulation strategy that began in 2020 and has accelerated in recent years. MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, has made it clear the company views Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and has no intention of selling. As Saylor famously stated: “Never. No. We’re not sellers. We’re only acquiring and holding bitcoin… that’s our strategy.” This long-term “HODL” stance underpins MicroStrategy’s goal of continually increasing its bitcoin holdings regardless of market fluctuations. Historical Bitcoin Acquisition Timeline MicroStrategy’s path to 1 million BTC can be understood by looking at how rapidly its holdings have grown: Summary of Holdings by Year: MicroStrategy’s BTC stack grew from ~70k in 2020 to ~447k by end of 2024, and ~638k by late 2025. This exponential trajectory underscores the company’s increasing conviction (and available capital) for Bitcoin acquisitions. Public Statements on Future Bitcoin Plans MicroStrategy’s leadership has been very transparent about their long-term commitment to Bitcoin. Key insights from executives include: In summary, all public communications from MicroStrategy’s team convey unwavering bullishness on Bitcoin and an intention to keep buying for years to come. The company positions itself as a pioneer of the “Bitcoin standard” for corporations, frequently evangelizing Bitcoin’s virtues to other CEOs (e.g. via its annual Bitcoin for Corporations conferences). MicroStrategy’s message: they’re all-in on Bitcoin and still just getting started. Financial Capacity for Future Purchases How can MicroStrategy actually fund a march to 1 million BTC? The company’s financial strategy provides the answer: raise capital aggressively and plow it into Bitcoin. Key elements of their financing capacity include: Bottom Line: MicroStrategy has built an extensive capital arsenal for future Bitcoin purchases – including authorized but unused capacity in the tens of billions of dollars across common and preferred stock programs. In total, by mid-2025 the company had already raised about $47 billion in equity capital over five years for its Bitcoin strategy, and it signaled plans to raise yet more. With these financing mechanisms, MicroStrategy theoretically has the firepower to acquire the remaining Bitcoin needed to reach 1 million BTC (though practical and market constraints, discussed next, will influence the timing). Market Conditions Influencing the Acquisition Rate Several market and macroeconomic factors will affect how quickly MicroStrategy can continue buying Bitcoin and reach 1,000,000 BTC: In summary, favorable market conditions – a rising Bitcoin price, strong investor appetite for MicroStrategy’s stock/preferreds, and accessible capital – would enable MicroStrategy to keep an aggressive pace. Unfavorable conditions – a stagnant or falling BTC price, shareholder fatigue, or tight credit/low equity premiums – could slow the pace. The company’s recent behavior (continuing to buy despite some criticism) suggests that as long as they can secure funding, they will push forward, even if it means weathering short-term stock volatility. Investors should thus expect MicroStrategy to remain a bold buyer, adjusting speed as needed but not fundamentally altering course. Timeline Projections to 1,000,000 BTC Taking into account MicroStrategy’s current holdings (~638k BTC) and its historical and potential acquisition rates, we can outline scenarios for how long it might take to reach 1,000,000 bitcoins. Below we consider a Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive case, based on different annual purchase rates. These scenarios are illustrative – the actual outcome will depend on the factors discussed (market conditions, financing success, etc.): The table below summarizes these scenarios with a simple year-by-year estimate of total BTC holdings, assuming a starting point of ~640k BTC (around late 2025 levels) and constant annual purchase rates in each case: Table: Projected Bitcoin holdings under different annual accumulation scenarios. Bold entries indicate crossing 1,000,000 BTC. Under the Conservative path, MicroStrategy would not hit 1 million BTC within this 5-year window (reaching ~840k by 2029, and only in the early 2030s would it cross seven figures). The Moderate path achieves the milestone by about 2029. The Aggressive path has MicroStrategy breezing past 1 million as early as 2027, and potentially holding 1.3+ million BTC by 2029 if that pace were sustained. It’s important to stress that these are simplified projections. In reality, MicroStrategy’s annual BTC accumulation has varied wildly – from just +8k in 2022 to +234k in 2024 – depending on market opportunities. The company tends to be opportunistic, as seen in late 2024 when it accelerated buys during a Bitcoin price surge and favorable stock conditions. Future purchases will likely come in spurts rather than a steady linear rate. For example, MicroStrategy might conduct another big raise during the next crypto bull run (if Bitcoin, say, pushes well beyond $100k) and add a large block of coins in a short time. Alternatively, if the market is lukewarm, it might accumulate more slowly quarter by quarter. Conclusion How long might it take MicroStrategy to acquire 1,000,000 bitcoins? Based on current holdings (~638k BTC) and past trends, it could be as soon as 2–3 years in a bullish, capital-rich scenario, or closer to 7–10 years under more cautious conditions. MicroStrategy’s own actions suggest a strong desire to reach this milestone sooner rather than later. The company has explicitly built the capacity to raise tens of billions more dollars and has demonstrated willingness to deploy huge sums into Bitcoin at every opportunity. As of early 2025, management said they had already executed $20 billion of a planned $42 billion capital deployment for Bitcoin – well ahead of schedule – indicating an accelerated timeline. Crucially, MicroStrategy’s ability to continue at an aggressive pace will hinge on external factors: the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price, investor tolerance for its high-risk strategy, and macroeconomic liquidity. The firm’s stock performance and status (e.g., inclusion in major indices, or competition from a Bitcoin ETF) will also influence how much fuel it can add to the fire. So far, Saylor and his team have been adept at navigating these factors, keeping MicroStrategy at the forefront of Bitcoin accumulation. If Bitcoin’s market remains strong and MicroStrategy retains investor confidence, reaching 1,000,000 BTC by the latter half of this decade is plausible under an aggressive strategy. In any case, MicroStrategy has cemented itself as a unique corporate entity – essentially a Bitcoin holding company – and its quest for 1 million BTC exemplifies the boldest expression of the “Bitcoin standard” in the corporate world. Every quarter brings them closer to that historic figure. Given the company’s track record and statements, it wouldn’t be surprising if MicroStrategy ultimately becomes the first corporation to hold one million bitcoins, whenever that day comes.

Title: Why the Oracle-OpenAI deal caught Wall Street by surprise | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure. On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it. Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors. “OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.” Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business. “Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said. But even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain. OpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom. Meanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year. Power is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute. Industry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear. Despite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday. Compute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now). But compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups. So far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon. With a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change. The company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.

Title: Klarna CEOs $1 Billion Stock Pledge Pays Off With Surge In Wealth

Klarna Group Plc Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski didn’t sell any shares in his company’s blockbuster IPO this week — but he still managed to use the listing to consolidate his control over the company. Ahead of the offering, the 43-year-old founder pledged Klarna shares as collateral to secure a $112 million loan, according to a person familiar with the matter. The lender SEB AB provided the funding last month, with Siemiatkowski pledging a roughly $980 million stake in exchange as collateral, based on Klarna’s IPO price and regulatory filings. After securing the financing at a low loan-to-value ratio of 10%, he used the proceeds from the loan to buy out another investor in a special purpose vehicle that owns shares of Klarna, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public information. While Siemiatkowski already controlled the special purpose vehicle, the deal allowed him to further increase his economic interest in the company, the person said. That bet is already paying off. Siemiatkowski’s Klarna stake has risen more than $65 million in value since the company began trading Wednesday, adding to the equity buffering his share pledge, according to Bloomberg calculations. He now holds a stake worth more than $1 billion even after Klarna’s shares fell 6.7% on Thursday, reversing part of an almost 15% surge the previous day. “I’m a big believer in the company,” Siemiatkowski said in an interview. “I’ve signed up for this long term.” A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment on Siemiatkowski’s borrowing. Simmering Tension The size of Siemiatkowski’s stake in Klarna has long been a source of simmering tension inside the company. In the lead up to the IPO, he repeatedly clashed with his estranged co-founder Victor Jacobsson. Throughout 2024, the two argued over governance, including how the company would list and how much control Siemiatkowski would ultimately have in a publicly-traded Klarna. Just three weeks before Klarna first filed to go public in 2024, the firm’s shareholders voted to oust one of the company’s board members, Mikael Walther, after he challenged some governance decisions. Walther had long represented the interests of Jacobsson on the board. The SEB transaction offers a glimpse at how the rich can leverage their assets and the perks banks offer ultra-wealthy clients. While Siemiatkowski is doubling down on Klarna, pledging stock typically helps executives diversify their wealth and boost liquidity without selling part of their major assets. Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison has put up company shares to fund a lavish lifestyle that includes trophy properties, America’s Cup sailing teams and the Indian Wells tennis facility in California. Mat Ishbia, owner of the Phoenix Suns, pledged more than half of mortgage giant UWM Holdings Corp.’s outstanding stock in 2023 to secure loans before buying the NBA team for a then-record $4 billion. Lending against individual stocks or a portfolio of listed holdings is often easier and quicker for banks to process as the value of the collateral is more readily verifiable than less liquid assets such as real estate, art or superyachts. But it can also result in faster demands for extra collateral to cover borrowing costs if the pledge asset’s valuation declines. “Many years back, I sold some” Klarna stock, Siemiatkowski said. “So I can afford a nice house with my wife and we can go on some nice vacations.” Staying the Same After this week’s offering, Sequoia Capital is expected to have about 22% of the voting power, regulatory filings show. Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen’s Heartland A/S is set to have around 8.9%, Jacobsson would have around 8.8% of the votes and Siemiatkowski would have 7.4%. Klarna and its backers ultimately raised $1.37 billion in the listing this week, which saw surging investor demand. Povlsen, CEO of Danish clothing retailer Bestseller, was among the biggest winners from the IPO with his family office notching gains of more than 600% from its investment in Klarna almost a decade ago. He has a net worth of $6.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Siemiatkowski isn’t expecting much to change for Klarna as it begins life as a public company. The firm was already providing investors with quarterly updates on its results and it’s faced heavy regulatory scrutiny as its business has grown around the world. Founded in Stockholm, Klarna rose to prominence as a provider of so-called buy-now, pay-later financing, which grew in popularity during a pandemic-era boom in online shopping. More recently, though, the fintech has been making a push into offering other banking products like savings, checking accounts and credit cards. Speaking from his company’s offices in New York on Tuesday, Siemiatkowski was relaxed about the events ahead. While the IPO looked to be going well, the executive was more excited about a recent trip to Bentonville, Arkansas that he’d taken to visit the grave of Sam Walton, the founder of retail giant Walmart Inc. Klarna has been cozying up to Walmart this year after the retailer made the company’s fast-credit options available to its shoppers and a fintech backed by Walmart took a stake in Klarna. “Visiting the grave of Sam Walton and just reflecting on the fact that this kid from Sweden was just about to sign a deal with the largest retailer in the world,” Siemiatkowski recalled. “On an emotional level, unfortunately have to say that beats the IPO.” On Wednesday, Siemiatkowski live streamed his morning from the New York Stock Exchange using his Meta Platforms Inc. smart glasses, giving viewers a birds eye view as he rang the bell on the trading floor flanked by his top deputies and Michael Moritz, Klarna’s chairman. He was also donning a baseball cap with the words “The Last Blockbuster.” Blockbuster was once the largest video rental chain in the country. But as more consumers turned to streaming services in recent years, the company collapsed. There’s now just one Blockbuster left, located in Bend, Oregon. Siemiatkowski’s cap retails for $26 on that store’s website, which doesn’t take Klarna. With assistance from Pei Yi Mak. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: NBCU's one-size-fits-all severance package for RTO workers shows just how much power employers have right now

Time Published: 2025-09-12T17:56:56Z
Full Content:
The standard, tenure-based severance package is being put to the test. NBCUniversal is offering separation pay that isn't tied to employees' number of years on the job, an atypical move that some leadership experts say risks denting worker loyalty in the long term. The media giant told employees this week that if they don't want to comply with a new return-to-office mandate, they can leave and take a severance package comprising eight weeks of base salary, Business Insider first reported. The financial part of the arrangement is unusual, experts say, because severance packages are normally aligned with employees' length of service. An NBCU spokesperson previously declined to comment on internal communications and policies and didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. If other companies follow NBCU's example, workers may become less inclined to stay with any one employer for more than a few years, cautioned Raj Namboothiry, head of staffing firm Manpower's US division. That's because a potential future severance package would exclude the kind of safety net they could count on with a traditional package, he said. Since standard packages are tied to tenure, the longer an employee stays with a company, the bigger the payout they would receive. To be sure, NBCU is providing its eight-week pay-for-all packages on a voluntary basis. Companies including Amazon issued RTO mandates without granting any severance pay to workers who choose not to comply. Extending fixed payouts after more general layoffs would be dicier as far as loyalty goes, said Namboothiry, since workers would have no choice in the matter. These days, fixed severance packages after either layoffs or RTO mandates may not pose a problem for most leaders since job opportunities are scarce, said Nicole Kyle, cofounder of CMP Research, a research and advisory firm focused on the future of work. More people are currently unemployed and actively looking for work than there are job opportunities, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Employers have the leverage right now," Kyle said. But should the tables turn down the line, fixed packages may discourage people from seeking jobs at firms with a reputation for offering them in lieu of the standard tenure-based kind, Kyle added. "The labor market is going to remember," she said. There is some precedent to companies offering fixed payouts as part of voluntary separation agreements, but it is rare. In late 2021, online mortgage startup Better abruptly laid off about 900 employees and provided them with 60 days of severance pay, regardless of tenure. A more high-profile example occurred about five months after Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022. The billionaire sent the social-media company's employees an email instructing them to fill out a form asking if they wanted to remain at the company and be part of an "extremely hardcore" culture, Business Insider reported at the time. Employees who didn't opt to stay would be given three months of severance, Musk said in the email. Many Twitter employees took the deal. NBCU's package is available to US and UK staffers at the vice-president level and below. They must accept it by October 3 and stay through the end of 2025. By giving nearly four months' notice, NBCU is letting its work-from-home aficionados get a big jump-start on their job search in a tough market, said Anna Tavis, New York University's department chair of human capital management. While eight weeks of pay isn't a large sum for those at the VP level, Tavis said it could be an enticing offer for lower-level employees, which she believes may be NBCU's intention. It also might be more enticing for newer employees, said Kyle. Offering the same number of weeks' worth of severance pay for all departing staffers would likely appeal less to longterm employees who'd be eligible to receive far more money with a tenure-based package, she said. Employers looking to trim their workforces may be using return-to-office orders as an alternative to layoffs, expecting some employees to quit rather than comply, as Business Insider has reported. Tavis said that the approach is "less painful and more humane" than mass cuts. Still, the move poses risks, she added, as companies could see top talent walk out the door and land a job at a competitor that allows remote or more hybrid work. "You often first lose the people who have other options," Tavis said. Jump to

Title: Tempus AI: Is TEM Stock A 10x Growth Story?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/tempus-ai-is-tem-stock-a-10x-growth-story/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T13:59:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Great news for Tempus AI stock! The company has just received FDA approval for an upgraded version of its Tempus Pixel platform — a cardiac imaging system that uses advanced AI to deliver highly accurate images of a patient’s heart. Remember when we talked about TEM last month and how it might double to $130? Well, it’s already climbed more than 33% in just a month. But here’s the surprising part: the opportunity for Tempus AI may not stop at a 2x return. It can potentially be a 10x story or more. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not—once you understand what Tempus AI actually does. Think of Tempus as the “Google of healthcare data.” The company has built the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data and uses AI to turn this information into insights for precision medicine. While it started in oncology, it has since expanded into cardiology, radiology, and even mental health. Tempus doesn’t just gather data—it transforms it into real-time insights that help doctors make better treatment decisions. It’s like giving physicians a supercomputer that analyzes millions of patient cases to recommend the best care for each individual. Let’s talk numbers. Tempus has grown its revenue at an average rate of 50% over the past three years. In Q2 2025 alone, revenue grew 90% year-over-year, and the company raised its full-year outlook to $1.26 billion—over 80% growth from last year. Looking for more – revenue is expected to double over the next three years. The company is also nearing EBITDA profitability. This isn’t just growth—it’s accelerating growth with improving margins. Of course, these strong numbers come with the volatility typical of high-growth stocks. If you’re looking for upside with less risk than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Tempus AI’s potential for explosive growth isn’t wishful thinking—it’s supported by solid fundamentals. Beyond profits, there’s a bigger reason Tempus AI must grow: healthcare justice. AI can help correct systemic disparities in care that affect underserved communities. Some populations face higher mortality from certain diseases due to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, creating major burdens. By using AI to tailor treatments and improve accuracy, Tempus can help close these gaps—making precision medicine accessible to everyone, not just patients at top hospitals. This mission will likely fuel broad social support. Let’s crunch the numbers. Tempus is projected to make about $1.26 billion this year. Imagine it scales revenue 15x. Of course, not overnight, think long term. With the AI healthcare market forecast to top $800 billion, can Tempus claim just 2.5% of that? It’s possible, especially if it captures more R&D spending from big pharma. For context, just five companies—Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Roche, AbbVie, and Eli Lilly—spent over $75 billion on R&D last year alone. If Tempus grows to $20 billion in revenue, it will likely become highly profitable. With medtech firms typically earning net margins of 22–25%, that implies about $5 billion in profit. At a median multiple of 35 times earnings, Tempus’s valuation would hit $175 billion—up from $15 billion today. This level of growth isn’t unprecedented. Look at Intuitive Surgical, which jumped 8x in value over the past decade—from $20 billion to $165 billion. The best part? We don’t think ISRG stock is done yet. Tempus AI may follow a similar trajectory. Despite its promise, Tempus faces major risks. Regulatory approvals for each AI tool are slow, and new data privacy laws may bring hefty fines. The company is also still unprofitable with high R&D spending, meaning it may need to raise more capital, diluting shareholders. Competition is intense—from giants like Roche and tech titans like Google with deep pockets. And its valuation is steep: a $15 billion market cap on $1.3 billion in 2025 revenue. Any stumble has the potential to send its stock plunging, making that 10x dream a long shot. Remember, single-stock investing always carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which holds 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered stronger returns with lower volatility than the index, offering a smoother ride as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Overall, Tempus AI is a bold bet on the future of healthcare AI. The key question isn’t if it will succeed—it likely will. The real challenge is whether that success can deliver outsized returns from today’s lofty valuation. The next three to four years will be pivotal as it races to scale while the healthcare AI market matures and competition intensifies.

Title: Why Does David Ellison Want Paramount to Swallow Warner Bros. Discovery Whole? To Beat Rival Suitors to the Punch
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-warner-bros-discovery-acquisition-consolidation-analysis-1236515947/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor David Ellison’s Skydance Media just completed the $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global five weeks ago. Now, before Ellison and his team have even finished the work of laying off upwards of 2,000 employees at the newly merged Paramount Skydance to slash costs, the son of tech multibillionaire Larry Ellison is mulling what would currently be a $70 billion-plus deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. The question is: Why now? Popular on Variety Related Stories Emmys Behind the Scenes: Producers on the Boys & Girls Clubs Running Joke, Eric Dane's Absence, Nate Bargatze's Performance and More 'Severance's' Jessica Lee Gagné Makes Emmys History By Becoming First Woman to Win for Outstanding Cinematography For a Series (One Hour) Wouldn’t it make more sense to wait until WBD splits in half — to form Warner Bros. (HBO Max and studios) and Discovery Global (TV networks) — a transaction CEO David Zaslav says is on track to be done in April 2026? The WBD separation is designed to boost the value of its streaming and studios businesses by carving off the declining TV arm. Paramount Skydance could make a play for the standalone Warner Bros. without assuming the baggage (including the lion’s share of WBD debt) of the entity that will house CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery and other nets. And through a deal for standalone Warner Bros., Paramount Skydance would still get its hands on the key growth driver going forward: HBO Max. (The mind reels at what a fused HBO Max-Paramount+ might be rebranded.) One possibility is that a Larry Ellison-backed M&A play for WBD has been part of the Skydance strategy all along. The idea would be “to consolidate media assets during a period of industry-wide instability and build a conglomerate with a streaming-first focus wrapped with TV and film studios and potentially a larger linear television portfolio,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note Thursday. And the advantage of moving now is that it could “preempt a potential bidding war for only the Warner Bros. Streaming & Studios assets post-split,” Fishman noted. “By acting now, [Paramount Skydance] positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets.” Indeed, prior to news of Paramount Skydance’s prepping a bid for WBD, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Wells Fargo media analyst Steven Cahall issued a note that pegged the future standalone Warner Bros. as “an attractive M&A candidate” — with Netflix “the most compelling buyer,” and other potential suitors including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Sony and Paramount Skydance. Regarding the separated Warner Bros. streaming and studios biz, Cahall wrote, “This will be the only large IP asset for sale at a time when most studios/streamers have big aspirations.” The analyst acknowledged that Netflix has not historically made any big M&A deals. But he opined a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. had a number of benefits, including being able to “kickstart” a theatrical strategy for the streamer, help it scale video games and “most importantly [provide] premium content to members.” Cahall calculated the value of standalone Warner Bros. at around $65 billion. To be sure, any Paramount Skydance offer for Warner Bros. Discovery would face big financial and regulatory obstacles — arguably much greater than those that arose with the Skydance-Paramount merger. After Warner Bros. Discovery shares zoomed up 29% on the potential Paramount bid, WBD now has a market value of $40 billion. When adding in debt (minus cash and equivalents), the enterprise value of Warner Bros. Discovery is now about $71 billion. And that is a far bigger price than the Ellisons paid to swing Skydance-Paramount. “We think the high debt leverage of WBD is an impediment to a high bid for WBD’s shares,” Kenneth Leon, director of industry and equity research at CFRA Research, said in a Sept. 11 note. He suggested that, even if Paramount Skydance wins a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole, it may “be only interested in the businesses that will become Warner Bros. and not see meaningful value creation from the Discovery Global media portfolio.” But MoffettNathanson’s Fishman speculated that Paramount Skydance could see big benefits by pooling its TV business with WBD’s. “Overall, we would expect material cost synergies from the overlapping cable networks,” he wrote — i.e., layoffs. Fishman added that there are “presumably a high level of synergies from combining CBS News with CNN plus the long-term existing partnership between CBS and Turner with the NCAA’s March Madness Final Four.” Then there’s the question of whether a Paramount-WBD tie-up could get regulatory approval, as it represents a more horizontal combination of two media giants than Skydance-Paramount. Skydance was largely a production company, with limited overlap with Paramount Global. Already coming out against the notion of a combined Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who wrote in a post on X Thursday that such a media merger “must be blocked as a dangerous concentration of power.” The Trump administration OK’d the Skydance-Paramount merger, after Skydance made key concessions to the FCC including hiring a CBS News ombudsman to vet complaints of “bias” and promising to never bring back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the company. But Warren and others have alleged Paramount Global’s $16 million payment to Trump to settle his lawsuit (alleging CBS News’ “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with then-VP Kamala Harris) was a “bribe” to get Trump’s blessing on their deal while Warren also called out Trump’s claim that the new owners of Paramount promised $20 million worth of free advertising. “Remember when Trump announced a multimillion-dollar secret deal with CEO David Ellison? And then — shocker — Trump approved Ellison buying CBS/Paramount,” Warren wrote in the post. “Now, Ellison wants to take over CNN/Warner Bros.” (Skydance and Paramount said they complied with all U.S. laws throughout the merger process, including antibribery laws.) Whatever scenario ultimately unfolds, Zaslav for one seemingly will see his wish for media biz consolidation realized. After Trump was elected to a second term in November 2024, Zaslav expressed optimism the new administration would facilitate industry M&A. Trump 2.0, Zaslav said, “may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different” and that it may “provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why a Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery Merger Makes Sense | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The ink is barely dry on the $8 billion Skydance merger and the Ellisons may already be eyeing their next target Fresh off its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount appears ready to pounce on Warner Bros. Discovery in a bid to merge its way to becoming a next-generation media giant. Paramount’s new CEO David Ellison is reportedly preparing a majority cash bid for all of WBD’s assets, including its cable networks and movie studio. According to the Wall Street Journal, it would be backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — David’s father and newly-crowned as the world’s richest man. Warner stock closed up nearly 30% at the end of Thursday’s trading session, while Paramount was up more than 5%, with both companies hitting new 52-week highs of $17.24 and $87.89 per share, respectively. Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. A potential deal would give the diminished Paramount and Warner Discovery much-needed scale and an increased arsenal of content at a time where they’ve lagged behind Netflix and Disney in the streaming wars. Combined the new company would have a total of 203.4 million streaming subscribers as of the latest figures from the second quarter of 2025 — putting it just shy of Disney’s 207.4 million across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ in its latest quarter. Reaching numbers to be competitive with Disney and Netflix has been a long-stated aim of Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Paramount would also be able to tap Warner’s massive portfolio of assets, including Warner Bros. Television and Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, Discovery+, a slew of cable networks and other media businesses, including production studios in Burbank, California, and Leavesden, England. They would be paired with Paramount assets including the CBS network, Paramount Pictures and its studio, along with streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV and cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Nickelodeon. Additionally, the companies would have stronger bargaining power with advertisers, distributors and talent and the opportunity to generate massive cost savings. Paramount has already identified more than $2 billion in merger-related cuts that will be carried out through layoffs, a review of its real estate portfolio and a transformation of its technological infrastructure. Wolfe Research’s Peter Supino estimates that a combined Paramount-WBD could generate $3 billion in cost synergies, including roughly $1.5 billion from streaming & studios, $1.2 billion from Warner Bros. corporate costs and roughly $250 million from linear networks. “It’s a brilliant move,” Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of the Los Angeles-based investment firm Greif & Co., told TheWrap. “Everybody knows Larry Ellison has the ability to pull it off. So let there be no doubt, this is a doable deal, even though Paramount is a minnow and Warner is a whale. I don’t think anybody on the street has any doubts that they can complete this transaction.” Merging the two media companies together would catapult David Ellison further into the upper strata of power players in the entertainment world, one he had just entered through Skydance’s merger with Paramount. It would also expand the influence of the Ellison family in the media and tech space. In addition to WBD, the younger Ellison has been circling Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. President Donald Trump has also previously expressed support for the elder Ellison’s Oracle to buy TikTok. “For the Ellisons, pulling this off would crown their effort to build a next-gen Hollywood major,” Qualia Legacy Advisors managing director Aaron Meyerson said. “For David Zaslav, it could provide a strategic exit after years of cost-cutting and debt management.” That said, Hollywood insiders bemoaned the prospect of losing yet another major studio. “You have 20 percent fewer people to sell to. Finding the next Jordan Peele, the next Daniels [Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert] — the threshold gets harder and harder,” said one top executive from a rival studio. “And does it become a free for all? Does Apple try to buy Universal?” the executive continued, suggesting that the sparse details from Thursday’s leak suggests a trial balloon rather than a serious bid. “If I were looking to do R&D and test the market, today was very successful,” this person said. Even if a deal goes through, Howard Homonoff, a strategic advisor to media and tech companies and managing director of Homonoff Media Group, told TheWrap that many important strategic questions remain unanswered. For one, the combined company could be exposed to too many cable networks at a time when that business is in decline. It’s also unclear if combining Paramount+ and HBO Max would be enough to close the gap with streaming heavy-hitter Netflix. “It’s a bigger player, but it still leaves a lot of questions for future investors about what the growth strategy is,” Homonoff said. Still, the chance to increase the reach and scale of the companies may be worth the risk. Ellison’s move comes as the Zaslav-led media giant has been working towards a split of its linear network (Discovery Global) and studios and streaming businesses (Warner Bros.) by mid-2026. MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said that getting a bid early could preempt a potential bidding war for WBD’s streaming and studio assets post-split. “By acting now, Paramount positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets,” Fishman wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. “Perhaps just as important, the odds of the deal clearing regulatory review may be higher for the Skydance team given its recent success in closing the Paramount transaction.” Among the potential rival bidders that Fishman floated include Comcast, which is currently in the process of its own spin off of network assets with Versant, and Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which previously kicked the tires on Paramount prior to Ellison’s acquisition. Representatives for Comcast, Apollo and Sony did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Greif also didn’t rule out the possibility of a big tech player like Apple, Amazon, Google or other private equity firms entering the ring. “Warner Brothers is an extremely attractive asset. I think everybody pays attention to this one and doesn’t let it go,” Greif said. “Splitting would have definitely attracted a feeding frenzy. This move is trying to catch everybody flat footed, but you can’t really catch anybody flat footed for long. They’re all going to think long and hard about getting into a bidding war with Larry Ellison.” While a deal is doable, there will obviously be key challenges for Ellison to overcome if he ultimately makes a bid. Among the challenges are WBD’s massive $35.6 billion in gross debt to pay down on top of Paramount’s own $15.5 billion. Experts also aren’t ruling out potential antitrust, regulatory or political scrutiny from the Trump administration and other lawmakers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already knocked a potential tie-up as a “dangerous concentration of power” and warned it “must be blocked.” “Regulators would scrutinize overlaps in broadcast (CBS), cable news (CNN), sports rights and streaming under the (Department of Justice)’s tougher merger guidelines and to a lesser extent the FCC,” Meyerson said. “It’s a bold swing with real industrial logic, but the political and financial execution risks are equally large.” Any deal, however, would likely be supported by the deep-pockets of the elder Ellison, whose net worth sits at $367.2 billion. And given Paramount’s $7.7 billion bid to acquire the rights to UFC, the Ellisons have shown they’re willing to spare no expense if it gives them a competitive advantage. On the regulatory front, the Ellisons have already done a lot of work to gain favor with Trump, who could ease any regulatory concerns. There’s also the question of whether Zaslav is ready to hand over the reins or not, though this isn’t the first time a merger with Paramount has been mulled. Ultimately, if the offer is rich enough, it may not be up to him. “There will be pressure on him to act in the interest of the shareholders,” Greif said. “If the deal is deemed to be an attractive price, it’s a deal that gets done whether Zaslav has a position post-closing, or whether he just smiles all the way into happy temporary retirement. And it would be temporary retirement. Guys like that don’t stay on the sidelines for long.” Sharon Waxman contributed reporting to this story.

Title: What’s Happening With Adobe Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/whats-happening-with-adobe-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T12:36:30Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is seeing some gains after it recently reported strong quarterly results and provided an optimistic outlook, which was a bit of a surprise. Why do we say it's surprising? Well, in the past, Adobe's stock has actually dropped the day after its earnings reports 75% of the time. So, the big question is, should you buy ADBE stock right now at around $360? We believe the answer is yes. Adobe has been a bit of an underperformer this year, down about 20% while the S&P 500 is up 12%. Part of this is due to its slower-than-expected growth in the AI space. This past quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) from AI-influenced products reached over $5 billion, which is an increase from the $3.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024. To be frank, a $5 billion figure might seem small for a company of Adobe's size, especially when other tech giants like Google and OpenAI are generating much more from the AI boom. However, the market is smart and has likely already taken this slower AI growth into account. At its current price of $360, ADBE stock is trading at 18 times its trailing adjusted earnings. That's half of its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36. This means that from a valuation standpoint, ADBE looks very attractive. Beyond the valuation, our analysis of Adobe’s performance across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operational and financial foundation. We'll delve into these factors in the sections below. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ADBE stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Adobe's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Adobe's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Adobe's balance sheet looks very strong. ADBE stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on ADBE stock? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Adobe Stock? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Adobe's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Despite being more expensive than the benchmark index, Adobe's valuation has become much more attractive recently. Given the company's strong performance in the above parameters and attractive valuation, we believe ADBE stock is a good buy right now. Of course, we could be wrong, and investors may not be willing to pay a premium for the stock due to its slower-than-expected AI growth. However, if you have a 3-5 year investment horizon, our conclusion is that ADBE is a good stock to own at current levels. While ADBE stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Posted on September 12, 2025 by Nick Roach 3 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 23. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t post an update for Public Alpha 22, so this post will cover everything new in Public Alpha 22 and Public Alpha 23. Since Public Alpha 21, we implemented 247 bug fixes and improvements and released two new features, including the new Responsive Editor and Custom Attributes. You’ll notice the bug fixing has ramped up significantly as we near the beta launch, and the team has transitioned away from feature development. Even though the development team is focused on fixing bugs and prepping for the beta launch, I found time to squeeze in a couple of surprise features. Custom Attributes were released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 23. 🎉 This new feature allows you to add any attribute, such as alt, title, rel, and aria-label, to elements and most sub-elements. Divi has had support for specific attributes, such as class and ID, but now you can add any attribute to any element. This is especially important for accessibility, allowing you to, for example, add alt text to images, and roles and labels to non-semantic elements like an icon-based button. The new Responsive Editor was released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 22. 🎉 This editor lets you quickly view, modify, and reset the responsive, hover, and sticky states for any setting while in any view mode. In Divi 5, you get the best of both worlds: natural, intuitive editing, where all changes made while in a particular view mode apply automatically, and the new responsive editor, which allows you to make swift changes to all states at any time. Here is a list of all the changes implemented since Public Alpha 21. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. We aim to enter beta in ~1 month. Almost the entire team is focused on cleaning up the remaining bugs, and we’ll launch the beta as soon as we are confident that we have cleaned up the worst of them. The date we launch the beat will depend on the volume of new bugs reported over the next few weeks. Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it official, and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback. Stay tuned for a new Divi 5 version every two weeks. Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts. Learn about the new way to manage your Divi assets.

It means developers are ready to build for the next generation of Divi’s framework.... Whatever about Elegant Themes being satisfied, there are still a lot of issues cropping up with migration. • Page layouts missing. • Many pages failing to load in the builder and have to be reimported from an older install to reinstate. • Product category pages always rendered incorrectly and sometimes completely missing. Headers on these pages completely out in terms of spacing. • Often the migration process butchers third party shortcodes. • Many other content and styling anomalies. These would need to be addressed, before we could safely say that we don’t need Divi 4 anymore. Not understanding the removal of CSS class and Class ID? I get making additional items manual inserts. I don’t get why CSS Class and Class ID were removed by default to enable the ability to add additional custom attributes. Hey, Linwood! We’ve consolidated the CSS ID and Class fields into the new “Attributes” panel in the Advanced tab to streamline the interface. This new, more flexible system allows for the addition of any HTML attribute, not just “id” and “class,” which is a significant improvement for accessibility and advanced customizations. Adding your custom classes and IDs is still a straightforward process. In the “Attributes” section, you’ll simply add a new attribute, using “class” or “id” as the name and your custom class/ID as the value. Hope this helps!

Title: The new frontier: Meet the power players cashing in on the AI gold rush

As hundreds of billions pour into data center development, these are the names making a killing from AI investments. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If there is one unifying theme across the entire AI industry over the past year, it has been staggering, unprecedented investment. Hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into companies the world over, promising enormous innovation and profit-making opportunities in equal measure. Governments and private enterprises have scrambled to keep pace with its rapid evolution, and even if the biggest companies haven't managed to make a profit just yet, that's not stopping the investor dollars from flowing in. That's largely to the benefit of the companies receiving that level of interest and backing, but most of those companies are headed by individuals with large stakes in them. As those investments were announced and company stock prices ballooned in response, so did the personal fortunes of CEOs, founders, and investors, to truly eye-watering levels. Oracle's Larry Ellison "made" over $100 billion in a single day when it was announced his company had struck a $300 billion infrastructure deal with OpenAI over five years, catapulting him into position as the world's richest person overnight. He's far from an isolated example. We've collated a list of notable names who have been the biggest benefactors in the ongoing AI boom. Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in a Denny's in 1993 and, until the mid-2010s, was primarily known within the relatively niche world of PC gaming enthusiasts. However, in the latter years of the decade, he was tipped by Fortune to power the AI revolution, and from the back of that, his personal wealth exploded. By 2019, he was worth $3 billion, ballooning to $100 billion by mid-2024, and reaching a peak of $243 billion in August 2025, before falling to around $157 billion at the time of writing. This tracks almost exclusively with the Nvidia share price. Huang maintains around 3.8% of the company and remains its largest shareholder. Huang is one of the many AI CEOs spearheading the enormous global investment in AI, promising to help build as much as $500 billion in "AI factory" data centers in the U.S. alone by 2029. Even if he doesn't quite hit that milestone, though, Nvidia GPUs are the fastest and most capable for AI training and inference, and that sees no sign of slowing. As the head of the world's most valuable company at the forefront of the hottest investment industry in the world, it would be no surprise to see Huang's personal wealth continue to grow in the years to come. Huang has maneuvered Nvidia into a keystone position in this burgeoning industry. While the likes of Meta used to train its AI on internally developed hardware, today, they use Nvidia GPUs. As does xAI, and OpenAI. Even though Chinese developers can't get the best Nvidia GPUs, they've still bought up H20s in the hundreds of thousands. The plan moving forward is to continue the upsell. Nvidia recently announced its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU platform, which is multiple times faster for AI inference workloads than older Hopper-based designs, and allegedly up to 45% faster running DeepSeek than even existing Blackwell GPUs, like the GB200. Huang is taking the yearly upgrade model that turned Nvidia into a leading gaming business, and applying it to AI and data centers. He's encouraging the building of "AI factories," which are described like money printers: GPUs and electricity go in one end, and money comes out the other. Nvidia wants to sell the world on the "economics of inference," and it wants to sell them the hardware to help them benefit. The new richest man in the world, Larry Ellison is worth $383 billion at the time of writing. He founded the company that would become Oracle in 1977, and remained its CEO until mid-2014, though he retains roles as the CTO and executive chairman. He has a range of business investments that make up his expansive portfolio, including 10s of millions of Tesla shares, and a commanding stake in Paramount Skydance. But it's his 40% stake in Oracle that has seen his net worth expand so rapidly in recent years. In 2020, he was worth around $67 billion, but by 2025, when Oracle was announced as a partner in the massive Stargate project, his net worth began to skyrocket. By mid-2025, it was over $200 billion, and following the announcement of another $300 billion partnership with OpenAI, he became the world's richest man; at least, temporarily. Staying there may depend on the real-world feasibility of the deal. Although Oracle is a company worth in excess of $600 billion, it holds a lot of debt, and will reportedly need to take on a lot more of it to secure the hardware and build the infrastructure it will need to supply OpenAI in the first place. On top of that, OpenAI will have to figure out how to pay for it. With its revenue for 2025 predicted to be between $15 and $20 billion, and none of it profit, it doesn't even generate enough to pay for a portion of a single year of this deal. And still, it's been struck and confident plans made for its commencement in 2027. Oracle has announced its intention to build data center facilities in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, and New Mexico with partner firm Crusoe. With much of Oracle and Ellison's value now resting on the projected annual revenue from this OpenAI deal, both companies will need to follow through to keep Oracle riding high. The youngest member of this list, Alexandr Wang is the current chief AI officer at Meta, a role he received after Mark Zuckerberg invested over $14 billion in his company, Scale AI, pushing his personal net worth up to $3.2 billion. He founded Scale AI in 2016, aged just 19, as a data labeling and model evaluation service. Within five years, the company was worth over $7 billion, and Wang's personal net worth reached a billion for the first time. Wang is estimated to maintain a 5% stake in Scale AI, though the company is not publicly traded, so it's unknown how much any such stake would be worth. Wang is now a prominent figure within Meta and is effectively the head of its AI developments, though presumably with some deference to Mark Zuckerberg. He'll be looking to spearhead Meta's plans for AI superintelligence. Although it doesn't have a definitive definition, it's a lofty goal the company is targeting in an effort to leapfrog the immediate efforts of its contemporaries. Scale AI will run in his absence, but it seems likely to slowly pivot to more government and militaristic roles in the years to come. Wang has been a consistent presence within the tech circles of the Trump administration, and Scale AI has signed deals in 2025 with the United States Department of Defence to use AI to plan ship movements and with the Qatari government to use AI tools in predictive analytics. A fixture on billionaire lists of all kinds for the best part of 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg pivoted from hyping the metaverse to pushing the AI future after the success of ChatGPT in 2022/2023 - although Meta AI has been a branch of Meta since 2013 (then called Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research). Although Meta has largely garnered AI-related headlines for its spending habits more than its products, it's still a major player in the AI space, and Zuckerberg has pushed artificial intelligence development as one of the core products of his company moving forward. Much like the Metaverse was before it. Perhaps that's why Zuckerberg's personal wealth hasn't ballooned quite like some of the others on this list, but he still has one of the largest single-day value pops on his resumé. In July 2025, his net worth leapt over $28 billion in a single day after the Meta stock jumped following strong revenue reports. However, at the time, investors were seemingly excited by the potential of Meta's AI investments, which had been aggressive, especially with regard to bringing in talent like Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg has set his AI sights higher than most, though. Where OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic are mostly focused on developing functional AI tools today, Meta isn't competing directly and is instead said to be focusing its research efforts on developing "super intelligence." This would be an AI model with greater than human-level intelligence. It would need to be more functional and capable than even general intelligence AI, or AGI, which is seen as the goal of many AI research and development projects. But since no one has clearly defined that, or shown any sign we're close to such a breakthrough, the idea of doing something much more capable than that in the near term is hard to imagine. Elon Musk is a divisive figure with fingers in many pies. While most of his wealth derives from shares in Tesla and SpaceX, he is also a majority shareholder in xAI, which produces the Grok artificial intelligence most commonly used on Twitter/X. When Musk used xAI to purchase X Corp (X's parent company) in March 2025, it valued the combined holdings of the two companies at $80 billion. He's since gone on to announce he's buying an entire power plant to run AI inference, and hopes to buy 50 million Nvidia GPUs. The xAI valuation contributes mightily to Musk's total net worth of around $400 billion, depending on market fluctuations (at the time of writing, Larry Ellison and he are bouncing back and forth for the top spot). This is close to double his net worth from 2022, but while his AI endeavours have contributed to that, it's the Tesla share price that has been the main driver of his wealth generation. What's next for Musk and his AI efforts is hard to pin down. He's always talked a big game about his companies and services, whether it's promising self-driving cars within two years over a decade ago, or reaching Mars before 2030. His latest claims are that AI will be smarter than a human by 2026 and smarter than the combined intelligence of all humans by 2030. He wasn't clear whether Grok would be the AI to make that achievement. More recently, Grok has been embroiled in scandals where it praised Hitler and allows users to create sexually-explicit deepfakes of celebrities. Even if superintelligence is possible with large language models, there's still a lot of work to do before we get there with the current crop of options. Many figures on this list, such as Musk, Alexandr Wang, Zuckerberg, and more, are all embroiled in a race to develop the most cutting-edge AI models possible. However, Jensen Huang's Nvidia is selling the most powerful chips to power it all. The outlook remains fierce, and with investors still clearly interested in the potential of AI, there could still be billions more to be made for the top names at all of these companies. As the AI race marches on and deals are being struck to democratize AI usage among people and populations, it's clear that the genie won't be going back in the bottle any time soon, even if OpenAI's Sam Altman admits that investors remain "overexcited" about AI.

Title: Target Stock To $45?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/target-stock-to-45/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T11:00:20Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Target (NYSE: TGT) has already decreased approximately 40% over the past year. This decline is painful, yet not entirely unexpected. Earnings growth has stagnated, competition is increasing, and the company is getting ready for a change in leadership. Q2 2025 brought a slight earnings beat, but the broader scenario remains one of sluggish sales and shrinking margins. Why is Another 50% Drop Possible? Target's performance during downturns should raise concerns for investors. The stock declined by 60.6% in the inflation shock from 2021 to 2023, while the S&P 500 experienced a 25.4% drop. It decreased 29% during Covid, slightly outperforming the market, but in the financial crisis, it fell 63.8% compared to 56.8% for the S&P. In summary, Target has a history of underperforming when consumer spending tightens. The stock has dropped over 10% in the past month. Could it decline further? Yes. From our perspective, three factors could converge to push shares down to $45—a decrease of about 50% from current levels: revenues, margins, and valuation. Target does have the potential for recovery, but its past performance, current fundamentals, and relative positioning indicate that the downside scenario should be taken seriously. However, investing in a single stock carries significant risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing exposure to upside potential. Additionally, see What’s Next For ANF Stock? Target's sales have been declining. Over the last three years, revenue has fallen at an average rate of 0.3%. FY 2024 reported $106 billion, a 0.7% decrease from the previous year. The latest quarter recorded another 0.8% decline. For further information, see: TGT Revenue Comparison Why? Discretionary demand remains low. Inflation has nudged shoppers towards value, benefiting Walmart (NYSE: WMT) for groceries and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) for bulk buys. Target's reliance on apparel, home goods, and electronics—categories currently under strain—has worsened the situation. Inventory misjudgments in 2022 led to heavy markdowns that hurt both sales momentum and profitability. Digital growth, which was once a strength, has decelerated since the pandemic. The upcoming CEO shift in FY2026 brings execution risk. The planned conclusion of the Ulta partnership removes a source of traffic in beauty. Meanwhile, Walmart and Costco continue to gain shares in groceries and traffic, leaving Target squeezed in the mid-market. Collectively, these pressures impact comparable store sales, brand relevance, and digital uptake—key factors for long-term growth expectations. Profitability is also declining. The operating margin averaged 5.4% over the last year, with free cash flow margin at 6.2% and net margin at 4.0%. These figures lag behind broader retail benchmarks. Why? A shift in sales mix towards lower-margin essentials, ongoing cost inflation, and continued shrinkage have all contributed. To maintain traffic, Target has relied on promotions, which have diminished pricing power. The gross margin was 29% in Q2, down from 30% the previous year. A retreat toward pandemic lows of 25–26% would reduce operating income by roughly 40%. At today’s price of $92 per share, Target is exposed to substantial downside risk if its fundamentals weaken. Suppose revenues contract by approximately 2% annually through 2026, discretionary spending continues to be subdued, and gross margins revert to 25–26% (from 29%) due to markdowns, wage inflation, and shrinkage. In that scenario, operating income could decline by roughly 40% compared to FY2024 levels. Net income may reduce from $4 billion ($8.86 per share) in 2024 to about $2.2 billion ($5 per share) in 2026—representing a 45% decrease. Markets seldom reward declining earnings. If sentiment deteriorates and investors reassess Target’s valuation closer to struggling department stores at 8x earnings—down from the current 11x multiple—the implied equity value would be around $45 per share. This reflects about a 50% downside from current levels. Timing remains uncertain. This scenario could develop over two years or four—but the risk is tangible if sales and margins continue to erode while competitors strengthen their positions. The forthcoming third-quarter results will serve as an early indicator: any stabilization in comparable store sales or gross margin might alleviate some pressure, but if weaknesses continue, investor skepticism is likely to rise. Progress may require time, but maintaining patience should yield results. Target’s advantage lies in its affordable, style-centric private labels. By enhancing these through improved merchandising and digital execution, the company has a clear pathway to success. Our analysis suggests that a favorable outcome is probable, although it may necessitate that both investors and customers adopt a long-term perspective. You might consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate solid returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 10x Upside For IONQ Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/10x-upside-for-ionq-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), a quantum computing company, has taken a major leap by figuring out how to mass-produce high-quality synthetic diamond films. Think of it this way: they can now bond these specialized diamonds onto standard computer chips—a potential game-changer for building quantum computers. Developed with Element Six, this breakthrough enables the company to manufacture these components at scale. It’s a core element of IonQ’s plan to reach a 2-million-qubit quantum system by 2030. In fact, IonQ’s acquisition of the UK quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics a few months ago was a pivotal step to speed up this goal. With this advance, the big question is whether it can drive even more explosive gains in IonQ’s stock. The stock has already surged 500% in the last year, but could it climb another 10x from here, reaching $400 a share? It can. In the sections below, we outline what could enable that outcome. That said, if you want upside exposure with lower single-stock risk, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which has delivered >91% returns since inception while outperforming the S&P 500 with lower volatility. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? IonQ is a high-risk, high-reward name with significant upside potential. Its trapped-ion technology and cloud-first strategy could provide an edge. To realize that potential, the company must sustain technical leadership, convert research into real-world applications, and monetize partnerships. For investors comfortable with risk, IonQ offers a way to invest directly in the future of quantum computing. However, meaningful risks remain in this early-stage space. Alternatively, explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Highest-Paid TV Hosts Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2025/09/12/the-highest-paid-tv-hosts-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T10:00:00Z

ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. Nowhere is the structural decline of linear television more on full display than in late night. For decades, the shows were reliable cash cows for the networks, but in recent years analysts estimate that none turn a profit. Then, in July, CBS made the abrupt decision to cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing $40 million in losses per year. And both ABC and NBC trimmed budgets last fall by moving to four-nights-per-week, whether their hosts wanted to or not. “I was bummed,” Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon tells Forbes. “I want to do it five days a week. I love doing it.” Still, a late-night talk show gig comes with a salary that places Fallon ($16 million), Jimmy Kimmel ($16 million) and Stephen Colbert ($15 million) among the highest-paid hosts on television, according to Forbes estimates. Even in its diminished state, linear television still generates significant revenue for networks, and it’s the talent from categories like late-night, morning shows, primetime news, sports and lifestyle who remain TV’s biggest stars. Combined, the top 25 hosts earn an estimated $582 million. With few exceptions, they make far more money than the stars of TV’s hit scripted shows. But with late-night extinction seemingly on the horizon, many have begun questioning whether hosts like Fallon will be the last to lead their respective programs—even one as long-running and venerable as The Tonight Show, which NBC has aired since 1954. “Oh gosh,” Fallon says, while contemplating whether he will be Tonight’s last host. “No, there'll be someone else. And I don't think it'll be a robot. I think it has to be a human being that makes mistakes and has a real conversation with people.” At the very least, it’s almost certain that this generation of TV stars will be the last mega-earners the medium ever produces. Most in the top 25 hosts have been in the spotlight for decades, and across the board, agents and managers report a strong downward pressure on compensation during contract renewal negotiations. Often the best that top talent can hope for is to maintain their salary from past years, and in many cases networks require work on additional shows or projects to justify staying at the same level financially. For example, in addition to late-night, Fallon and Kimmel now host game shows for their respective networks. Elsewhere, celebrity chefs are still living extra-large. Guy Fieri ($33 million), Bobby Flay ($33 million) and Gordon Ramsay ($33 million) each oversee a small universe of shows, and have earned overall production deals similar to those given to top scripted TV showrunners, trading profit participation for guaranteed annual fees. The details of these deals are usually closely guarded secrets. When one leaks out, like Fieri’s three-year, $100 million deal with the Food Network in late 2023, it can cause a correction in the market as competitors demand the same compensation—as was the case for Flay and Ramsay. And large contracts make for bad optics when networks have layoffs. Disney, for example, cut nearly 200 jobs from its ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks divisions in March, just a few months after renewing Good Morning America’s George Stephanopolous for an estimated $17 million annually. The exception to this trend is sports, where salaries have risen sharply in recent years and new talent has had the opportunity to break-in. Sports broadcasters and studio personalities account for eight of the top 25 this year, including seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, who, as a Fox football analyst, tops the list at $37.5 million annually. In the not-too-distant past, the idea that sports broadcasters could make more money than the athletes they talk about would have been ludicrous. But with media companies shelling out billions for league rights, and those games becoming by far the most-watched events on television, paying a few million more for premium talent is seen both as an insurance policy for content quality and also an incentive for leagues to steer their best games to the network. The 48-year-old Brady was hired, for example, to bring star power to Fox’s NFL broadcasts after Troy Aikman ($18 million) and Joe Buck ($16 million) were lured away to call ESPN’s biggest football games. “As sports becomes a differentiator, and as sports rights become more precious and expensive, given both the attention and the number of entities negotiating for them, that certainly causes other content formats and money to be pushed out,” says Neal Zuckerman, a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. “There's only so much you can spend on content in order to make a reasonably profitable business.” Another bright spot on the list is the number of women who are represented. Three hosts —Judy Sheindlen ($30 million), Rachel Maddow and Robin Roberts (both at $25 million)—are among the 10 highest-paid personalities on TV, while two more, Savannah Guthrie ($24 million) and Kelly Ripa ($22 million), rank among the top 15. But those outsize paydays will soon come to an end. Streaming platforms do not offer talent salaries comparable to the largest TV deals. Instead, platforms like YouTube share 55% of ad revenue with creators, incentivizing talent to bet on themselves. When the model works, it gives hosts bargaining power, as is the case with Pat McAfee ($20 million), who maintains ownership and editorial control of his daily talk show while licensing it to ESPN for a hefty fee (a portion of those earnings go toward paying his staff and production costs). Many in the industry believe there will be more deals like his in the future. In the meantime, here are the hosts commanding the most. Television insiders say the true value of Fox's Hail Mary deal to land the seven-time Super Bowl champion after his retirement from football in 2022 is impossible to calculate, since some of his compensation is in company stock (the price of which has risen significantly since Brady signed). In addition to his duties in the commentary booth, which began last fall to mixed reviews, Brady serves as a Fox ambassador in a number of company functions, which are used to justify the enormous compensation package. The mayor of Flavortown reset the market for lifestyle talent with his three-year, $100 million overall deal signed in late 2023, making him the highest-paid talent at the Food Network after it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery a year earlier. The 57-year-old restauranteur has made nearly 600 episodes of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives since it debuted in 2007, and he produces or appears in numerous programs across the WBD portfolio. Overall deals like Flay’s, which was renewed in November to match Fieri's annual total, charges every talent, producing and personal appearance fee, and in some cases even cuts of ancillary businesses like physical products and restaurants, against a set annual total. To make the deal worth it, the 60-year-old chef will have to stay busy, with Bobby’s Triple Threat debuting earlier this month and two other shows, Beat Bobby Flay and BBQ Brawl, currently in production. Much like the other top chefs on TV, Ramsay has set up a mini-universe of culinary shows for Fox, including Hell’s Kitchen, MasterChef, and Next Level Chef, enough to land the same top-of-market overall deal value in March. Yet unlike Bobby Flay and Guy Fieri, the 58-year-old Ramsay currently holds eight Michelin stars in his restaurant group and 40 million followers on TikTok, where he blew up during the pandemic roasting other users’ cooking videos. HBO's late-night offering Last Week Tonight is an Emmys juggernaut—winning 30 statues in the past 10 years—and drives an impressive amount of sign-ups to the re-rechristened HBO Max, which is how its 48-year-old host has earned a deal nearly double the size of what his late-night colleagues make at the networks. Much to Oliver's dismay, last year Warner Bros. Discovery hoped to maximize streaming engagement by delaying the posting of the show's clips to YouTube for several days, but reversed course with the 12th season in February. $30 million In her heyday, Judge Judy commanded more than $45 million per year for her eponymous show and owned the rights to its catalog of episodes. Since selling the rights back to CBS and leaving the network in 2021 (she remains a producer on the network's Hot Bench), the 82-year-old Sheindlin has started up three new court shows on Amazon's streaming channels. In a 2024 deal renewal, Amazon began syndicating Judy Justice and Tribunal Justice out to hundreds of local TV stations, an important bargaining chip to maintain her lofty fees. Last September, Seacrest replaced the legendary Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune, in addition to his regular hosting duties on American Idol and ABC’s New Years Eve program (which he also produces). Add in his radio show, which runs for four hours every weekday and pays him more than $10 million per year, and the 50-year-old host is almost never not on the air. Strahan is earning more money as a TV host than he ever did as a Hall of Fame defensive end for the New York Giants. He has lucrative deals with both Fox, as a studio analyst on the network's NFL coverage, and with ABC, to co-host Good Morning America and The $100,000 Pyramid. In addition to his TV work, Strahan also has revenue from personal appearances and his company, SMAC Entertainment, a talent management company that houses his personal brand. While meteoric talents have come and gone from Fox News, the 63-year-old Hannity has been at the network since its inception in 1996, making him the longest-running primetime host in cable history. And these days, TV isn't even his main gig—Hannity’s syndicated radio program reaches more than 600 stations nationwide, and his ownership stake in the show earns him more than $30 million each year. During an MSNBC contract renewal in late 2024, it's estimated that Maddow took a salary cut from $30 million annually to $25 million (a network spokesperson disputed the reported number), two years after switching from a five-nights-a-week schedule to appearing only on Mondays. Still, she remains the face of the recently rebranded MS NOW and has found other platforms to share her political commentary, including a weekly podcast and a handful of best-selling books. Morning shows are not only still highly profitable, in the case of Good Morning America, Forbes estimates the show accounts for the majority of ABC’s broadcast news revenue. That’s why the 64-year-old Roberts, who has co-anchored GMA for more than 20 years and has overseen the network’s No. 1 position in the ratings for the last 13 years consecutively, is the highest-paid talent at ABC. She also hosts primetime specials, such as a 20-year anniversary retrospective on Hurricane Katrina, which aired in late August. Going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump at a town hall in 2020 led to a massive pay raise for the 53-year-old Today host, who was the highest-paid member of the show even before the departure of co-host Hoda Kotb in January, because of her ability to handle important political interviews for NBC as well as holiday specials like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony. The 54-year-old morning show fixture has been through many co-hosts since taking the Live! job in early 2001, working with Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and Ryan Seacrest before being paired with her husband, Mark Consuelos, in 2023. The duo also have a separate series on ESPN, Running With The Wolves, cataloging their journey owning Italian soccer club Campobasso FC. Just a few years into a 10-year, $210 million contract with Turner Sports, Barkley threatened to retire last fall after his network lost the rights to broadcast NBA games. Instead, a deal was struck allowing Inside The NBA to continue being produced by Turner—keeping in place Barkley’s long-time co-hosts Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O’Neal (who Forbes estimates makes $15 million for the role)— but air before and after games on ESPN and ABC. In March, the reigning champion of sports talk shows got a pay bump from $12 million to $20 million annually, believed to be the largest contract ever given to an ESPN talent. As part of the new deal, Stephen A. will actually appear on fewer ESPN programs, freeing up time for projects such as his podcast—and though he's denied it many times, perhaps a run at presidential politics. ESPN's deal with the former Indiana Colts punter includes talent fees for his work on College Gameday and a licensing fee to air The Pat McAfee Show on the network, which the 38-year-old host uses to pay his staff and production costs. The deal structure means less take-home pay, but he maintains ownership and editorial control of the program. McAfee also served as a longtime commentator for WWE matches until June, when he stepped back from the role, citing fatigue. ESPN’s desire to have a Super Bowl-ready broadcast team for the 2026 season came at a price, luring the Hall of Famer away from Fox with a contract that is just a wee bit larger than the one CBS gave to fellow former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Romo’s total includes money he pays to a traveling editorial assistant and spotter on game days. Romo’s 10-year, $180 million deal with CBS kicked off an earnings bonanza in early 2020, ushering in the era where NFL broadcast talent can earn more money than most of the players on the field. While the ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback still sits in the No. 1 booth with Jim Nantz, he could soon be feeling the pressure around the corner from former defensive end JJ Watt, who was recently signed to CBS' No. 2 team. Though Cooper serves as an occasional correspondent to CBS’ 60 Minutes, the real money comes from his work on CNN, where he hosts a primetime show every weeknight and a weekly deep dive show on Sundays. The 58-year-old has been at the network since 2001. Since 2010, Harvey has hosted more than 1,100 episodes of Family Feud, not including international versions and spin-offs. One of those, Celebrity Family Feud, had its biggest season premiere in three years in July, attracting 4.2 million viewers. The 68-year-old earns also earns several million from a syndicated radio show on weekday mornings. A verbal slip-up from the Good Morning America co-host last fall led to Donald Trump’s libel lawsuit against ABC and the network’s subsequent $15 million settlement payout. But ABC immediately backed the 64-year-old political veteran, renewing his deal in December. In addition to GMA and This Week With George Stephanopolous, the pact includes a new politics show on Hulu and four hour-long primetime specials, though it’s ABC’s David Muir, not Stephanopolous, who will continue to host the network’s special news reports. In one of the more unique sports media moves in recent history, Fox let Joe Buck out of the last year of his contract in 2022 to join booth partner Troy Aikman at ESPN, in exchange for the broadcast rights to a Penn State-Purdue college football game. The 56-year-old Buck is now the highest-paid play-by-play announcer in sports history, and though he called a record 24 World Series at his previous network, he’s largely stuck to Monday Night Football at ESPN, outside of a few one-off MLB games like this year’s Opening Day Brewers-Yankees game. $16 million With a show ready-made for social media, Fallon’s The Tonight Show dominates late-night competitors in the digital space—but remains third in the ratings. And the 50-year-old host has found another use for his joyful enthusiasm, hosting game shows like Password and That’s My Jam as well as a new reality competition show On Brand that debuts on NBC on September 30. ABC’s late-night host since 2003, Kimmel has publicly mulled retirement for years and has a contract that will expire in mid-2026. Outside of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the 57-year-old comedian hosts the rebooted celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and voiced a character in this summer’s Smurfs movie. During this Emmy season, Kimmel has actively campaigned for his direct competitor, Stephen Colbert, calling CBS’s claims that Colbert’s show was losing $40 million per year “beyond nonsensical." Colbert is a favorite to win the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series this weekend, which would be his first win as host of The Late Show—though he did previously win 10 for The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. The 61-year-old host will remain on CBS until next May, and news of his cancellation has only juiced his viewership ratings further over his competitors. Estimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts. The figures represent pretax earnings specifically for TV work, though many talents on the list earn significant additional income from radio, endorsements, entrepreneurial ventures, personal appearances, investments or other categories. Fees for representation (agent, manager, lawyer etc.) are not deducted. Hosts are compensated with variety of deal structures, including traditional salaries, overall production deals for a slate of projects, or licensing agreements from which a talent pays staff and production costs. The above rankings estimate the total earnings paid by media companies to talent.

Title: AT&T tracked employee attendance to find 'freeloaders.' Now, it admits the system is driving workers to the 'brink of frustration.'

AT&T is reducing its reliance on an employee-attendance tracking system, admitting to workers that it hasn't been fully accurate and is "driving people to the brink of frustration." The system, known internally as presence reporting, automatically tracks the hours workers spend at their assigned office. Most are required to log at least eight hours a day, five days a week, on-site. The telecom giant is one of several companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan, and Microsoft, tightening return-to-office mandates and using new tech to track employee compliance. Executives at these companies say the moves boost collaboration and productivity. In a meeting last month, chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny said her division is reducing its reliance on presence tracking in response to employee concerns about the system and its accuracy. The system was originally introduced to identify employees who weren't showing up in the office. "We recognize that there's things about the report that are not correct," she said, according to audio obtained by Business Insider. "It is not something that I expect anybody to be looking at on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis." AT&T is also deemphasizing use of the tracking system for salaried employees companywide, a person familiar with the matter said. CEO John Stankey indicated in a memo to staffers last month (reported exclusively by Business Insider) that AT&T was shifting its use of behavioral data, such as presence reports. "We analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts," he wrote, "to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations." Stankey said that an individual's data must differ "significantly" from their peers before their name is attached to the behavior. "Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like," he said. Kenny said during the August meeting that the employee survey (which prompted the blunt memo from Stankey) had "lots of feedback" about the presence reports. She said the survey included critiques from workers who said they were struggling to make it to doctors' appointments without running afoul of the system, for example. Read more about Stankey's memo. While the survey does not appear to have included a direct question about presence reporting, it did ask whether employees agreed that AT&T's "policies and systems support me in delivering my best work." Kenny said in the meeting that roughly half of the respondents in her organization said "no," and that many voiced their concerns about the RTO mandate and presence reports in the freeform response. "I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created," Kenny said. "I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust." Business Insider has spoken with roughly a dozen employees from multiple divisions of the company this year about the system and its impact on their workplace experience. A spokesperson for AT&T declined to comment for this story, instead citing Stankey's August memo. Multiple employees told Business Insider that the system doesn't just log badge swipes at the entrance or exit; the presence report uses laptop network connections and mobile device location data to infer the hours an employee was at their assigned office. The tool was rolled out in response to the RTO push that began two years ago, and its usage ramped up as the attendance policy grew increasingly strict. Other companies, like Amazon and JP Morgan in particular, have also closely monitored employee behavior at work. Amazon previously used categories like "inconsistent badger" or "zero badger" depending on an employee's compliance with a three-day in-office mandate. The company ended up nixing the labels in favor of providing raw badging data to managers to use at their discretion. A recent survey by commercial real-estate company CBRE found that more than two-thirds of employers track employee compliance with attendance policies, and more than a third have taken some level of enforcement action. Enforcement that is too strict or error-prone can cause other headaches within an organization — pushing out experienced employees, making it harder to hire new talent, or undermining motivation and trust within the organization. Amazon's internal documents from last year indicated that its RTO policy was hampering its ability to recruit top AI talent, and a Harvard leadership expert said Meta's abruptly shifting RTO effort in 2023 was likely to cause a "huge amount of distrust" in the company. At the AT&T marketing and growth team meeting, Kenny said that the system helped leadership identify "freeloaders" who showed up for 30 minutes or two hours per day. "There were people who badged in for 10 minutes, got themselves a cup of coffee, and then left," she said. "The report was good for identifying the people who were abusing the system. We do not need this report for that purpose anymore, because we took action on the people who were the free riders." AT&T did not specify how many workers have been disciplined or dismissed in connection with their presence report information. AT&T workers told Business Insider that apparent glitches in the system could also be a hassle for employees who were pulling their weight. They said that in the first few months of this year, while the five-day RTO mandate was phasing in, their reports could be wrong by as many as several hours. In addition, briefly badging into an AT&T facility on a day off could trigger a person's daily average hours to drop below the mandatory eight hours for the week. "It was at its worst in March and April," one worker in New Jersey told Business Insider. "Sometimes you'd step out for lunch, and then it would stop counting." Though there were no immediate consequences from an incorrect report, employees were concerned the erroneous data could make them targets for layoffs. Some other business leaders have said RTO mandates have "encouraged" workers to quit voluntarily, allowing companies to avoid more expensive layoffs. AT&T previously told Business Insider the goal of its in-office rules is to foster better collaboration. It has also undertaken a multiyear effort to shrink its workforce. The company started this year with around 140,000 employees, down from more than 160,000 at the start of 2023. Telecom competitors Verizon and T-Mobile started 2025 with 99,000 and 70,000, respectively. Stankey has said that the company is looking to cut some $6 billion in costs as it decommissions its legacy copper-based network in favor of new fiber and 5G technologies. One worker in Georgia said that the presence reports changed the workplace reality for many salaried managerial workers, who aren't used to such detailed tracking of their workday. "We're supposed to be able to work a more flexible thing as long as we get our work done," he said. Another effect of the crackdown on underperformers has been the erosion of motivation for some higher performers to put in extra time. "The attitude has shifted," the New Jersey employee said. "They only count eight hours, so I'm just going to work eight hours." The AT&T employees Business Insider spoke with said their presence reports have gotten more accurate over the past few months. One shared their report with annotations that showed such an improvement. The question of employees' trust could take more than a few months to resolve. Have a tip?

Title: How AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom Can Ride Oracle’s $455B Cloud Surge

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, during its earnings announcement, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) delivered a striking revelation that surprised even the most optimistic analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) for its cloud division surged 359% year-over-year, reaching $455 billion, compared to only $138 billion in the previous quarter. This astonishing increase caused Oracle’s stock to rise nearly 36% in Wednesday’s trading, marking its largest single-day gain in many years. Consider RPO as Oracle’s guaranteed revenue stream—contracts that have already been finalized and are just pending execution. This is not speculative thinking or hopeful forecasts; it represents money that customers have already committed. CEO Safra Catz stated that Oracle anticipates securing several additional multi-billion-dollar customers soon, pushing its RPO beyond the half-trillion-dollar threshold within months. Here’s a brief overview of how the major AI silicon players will reap benefits from Oracle’s significant initiative. How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? For Oracle, turning these obligations into revenue hinges on the speed at which it can expand its infrastructure. This necessitates electricity, regulatory approvals, and high-performance GPUs, all of which are still in persistent global shortage. The corporation also increased its capital expenditure projection to $35 billion for fiscal 2026—a 65% rise that highlights the urgency of its AI infrastructure expansion. It’s no surprise that this exceptional guidance caused shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD to climb between 2% and 10%, as these chip manufacturers form the foundation of nearly every AI implementation. Each additional Oracle contract should correspond to increased demand for their semiconductors. Furthermore, in contrast to cloud competitors like Google, AWS, or Microsoft, Oracle is not developing its own bespoke AI chips. Instead, it has relied on GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Oracle maintains a robust partnership with AI compute standard bearer Nvidia, which provides most of the GPUs currently utilized in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle stands out among hyperscalers by offering so-called “bare metal” instances alongside Nvidia GPUs. This affords customers direct, exclusive access to high-end physical chips like A10, A100, H100, H200, and the flagship Blackwell chips, eliminating virtualization overhead. Such a setup enables businesses to optimize performance for model training and inference. Oracle’s AI supercomputers deploy these GPUs in densely packed, liquid-cooled data centers engineered for energy efficiency and throughput. This close collaboration allows Oracle to cater to some of the most sophisticated AI applications globally at scale. Nvidia GPUs have been the backbone of Oracle’s AI infrastructure, and this partnership may prove vital as Oracle carries out its extensive AI contracts in the upcoming years. Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns? Oracle has also been diversifying away from solely relying on Nvidia. In June, Oracle and AMD revealed that the AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs would be available on OCI, providing more than double the price-performance of the previous generation. Oracle plans to deploy as many as 131,072 MI355X GPUs, empowering enterprises to build, train, and perform inference on massive AI models with competitive economics. This collaboration guarantees that AMD will secure a significant portion of Oracle’s AI expenditures. The MI355X, based on AMD’s new CDNA 4 architecture and TSMC’s 3nm process, marks AMD’s most significant advancement yet in AI accelerators. For Oracle, this strategy broadens its hardware alternatives, diminishes reliance on a single supplier, and is expected to enhance negotiation leverage with Nvidia for GPUs, thereby controlling overall spending. Oracle’s revenue outlook is increasingly linked to AI inference, which involves executing trained models at scale for real-time user queries. Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $360? As AI transitions from development to widespread use, inference workloads are likely to significantly exceed training requirements, resulting in a recurring, utility-like demand stream. This is precisely where Broadcom and its custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) could emerge as substantial beneficiaries. While GPUs are predominant in training, inference at scale is expected to increasingly favor custom chips that provide better cost and energy efficiency. While Oracle still primarily utilizes GPUs for AI tasks, it appears that ASICs will undoubtedly play a more substantial role moving forward. This trend helps clarify why Broadcom’s stock surged nearly 10% on Wednesday—surpassing the gains of Nvidia and AMD, which increased by 2% to 4%—as investors speculate that Broadcom’s custom chips will capture part of Oracle’s workload. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a demonstrated track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, including the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What drives this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have produced superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, delivering a smoother experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How a $1 billion TikTok challenger unraveled

Time Published: 2025-09-12T09:30:02Z

Flip employees were riding high in mid-January. The TikTok challenger had just cracked the Apple App Store's top-five ranking. Downloads soared 855% month over month, Sensor Tower data showed, fueled by TikTok's imminent ban in the US. It was a dream scenario for an app that — with over $230 million in funding and a roughly $1.1 billion valuation — promised to reinvent social shopping through a mix of product reviews and entertaining videos. Raging wildfires had forced Flip's CEO, Noor Agha, to evacuate his Los Angeles home before he had time to retrieve his car or pack an extra pair of underwear. But in a January 15 interview with Agha and COO Eduardo Vivas, the executives sounded upbeat, if not a little frenzied. "To be in the business that we're in, given all the changes that are happening, is obviously very exciting for us," Vivas said at the time. Seven months later, Flip was dead. This is the story of how Flip crashed, as told by nine former employees, along with investors, creator partners, talent managers, and brands. Agha, Vivas, and other company representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Days after Business Insider's interview with Flip's top executives, President Donald Trump halted the TikTok ban. Flip raced to sustain its momentum, pouring money into ads and launching a $100 million equity fund to woo creators. With TikTok back in play, the buzz fizzled. Things unraveled quickly from there. In April, Trump tariffs raised costs for some Flip vendors and brand partners. Then Flip slashed jobs and began clearing out its LA headquarters. In May, the company received an eviction notice for its LA warehouse. By June, the company had slipped out of Apple's US App Store top 100, and within weeks, it cut much of its remaining staff without severance, three ex-staffers said. Flip shut down its app in late August. The company's demise caught many off guard. Employees who had watched a spike in downloads and onboarding of new brands believed business was humming. "I was as shocked as I could have been when that last round of layoffs came and how quickly it dissolved from there," one former Flip worker said. "This year, there were very optimistic conversations about where we were going and the idea that this was going to become huge." Flip's fate showcases the uphill battle that consumer startups face when trying to compete with tech giants like TikTok, Meta, or Google. The company spent millions of dollars to recruit creators and onboard new users via ads and referral credits. But competing with Big Tech companies, which have billions of users and the ability to outspend you at every turn, is no easy task. "It's actually crazy to build a new complete social platform from scratch," Agha told Business Insider in January. "The amount of pieces to make a social platform work is so insanely hard." It also demonstrates how difficult it has been for US companies to blend social video and commerce. TikTok has struggled to live up to its leadership's expectations for its e-commerce platform, Shop. Meta pulled back on some of its e-commerce bets, and Amazon killed its TikTok-like feed, Inspire, earlier this year. "Changing shopping behaviors is a slow and gradual process," said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst on the retail and e-commerce desk at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. "It takes time." Agha, who was born in Iraq, launched Flip in 2019 alongside cofounder Jonathan Ellman. Like many other founders, Agha is brimming with big ideas. "This was his app, his dream, his world he wanted to create," one former staffer said. Flip's original business idea was a try-before-you-buy social network where customers would receive clothing in the mail, take photos of the fits, and ask other users to vote on which items they should purchase. Fashion tech was in vogue, with apps like Snapchat experimenting with virtual try-on technology. Some entrepreneurs were eyeing China's massive social-shopping industry and considering how they might bring the business to the US. Live-shopping platform Whatnot had just kicked off in the US, later raising hundreds of millions of dollars at a roughly $5 billion valuation. While TikTok hadn't yet launched Shop in the US, it had begun experimenting with e-commerce features like in-video shopping links. By August 2021, when Flip announced its $28 million Series A round, the company had pivoted from try-ons to user-generated product reviews and live shopping videos. Flip was "well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of China and revolutionize social commerce in the US," investor Ullas Naik of Streamlined Ventures said at the time. Flush with cash, the company moved to grow its audience, unveiling a creator program in December 2021 that would pay users commissions on sales generated through their videos. Big social-media stars like Patrick Starrr, Hyram Yarbro, and Addison "Rae" Easterling joined the app. The company was growing quickly, writing in a July 2022 press release that it had expanded its user base by 500% in the first half of that year. Flip fundraised on that growth, announcing in July a $60 million Series B round at a $500 million valuation. That same year, the company moved into a new three-floor office in the El Segundo neighborhood of LA. The office had many of the markers of a buzzy tech startup. Workers had access to free coffee and snacks like Uncrustables. There was even a trampoline, which no one used, three former employees said. Music blared over the speakers, with one electronic track on repeat that Agha particularly enjoyed, three ex-staffers said. "The vibes in the building were always high energy," a third ex-employee said. While the company said it planned to use its 2022 funding to expand its team, it generally kept its head count lean. Much of the company worked in its El Segundo headquarters, where it required staffers to be in person five days a week. Some workers in functions like data entry were asked to work six days a week, with overtime pay. "It was a very intense startup vibe," said the first ex-staffer. "The people that work here are fully bought in." To keep growing in 2023, the company splurged on referrals, offering in-app credits sometimes worth over $100 to get new users signed up and scrolling more, The Information and The Free Press reported. In April 2024, Flip raised a $144 million round with participation from the adtech firm AppLovin, doubling its valuation to around $1.1 billion. A couple of months earlier, it had formed a partnership with AppLovin to power ads for brands on Flip. Around the time of the investment, the company also acquired Curated, a platform that connected shoppers with experts for advice on big purchases, for $330 million in stock. Curated's CEO at the time, Vivas, became Flip's chief operating officer. Vivas, a serial entrepreneur and high school dropout who previously sold a startup to LinkedIn, was on AppLovin's board of directors. The company was racing to expand Flip's user base as it sought to take on the industry's goliath: TikTok Shop. Like social-shopping competitor LTK, the company believed it had to expand beyond pure shopping content. Flip launched a new set of non-shopping videos, called Clips, in July 2024. "We think of shopping as a form of entertainment," Vivas told Business Insider in January. "People do it to have fun and enjoy themselves, but a feed cannot just be shopping content." Riding off the tailwinds of the looming TikTok ban, Flip downloads spiked. The company also invested in a stream of ads on TikTok to lure creators. Inside the company, staffers saw the surge of new users as a breakthrough moment. "We all thought it was going to take off from there," the first former Flip employee said. There was a feeling that "we made it past all of the hard parts of being a startup," they said. To boost non-shopping content, Flip pledged $100 million to its "Founding Creators Fund." It promised creators "grants" of up to $100,000 that would scale with Flip's valuation — so long as the creators kept posting to the app. Contracts set a five-year timeline for payouts, unless an acquisition triggered them earlier. Overall, a mix of user acquisition costs and macroeconomic headwinds stunted Flip's push to take on TikTok Shop. "It was ultimately just unsustainable because they had these very high customer acquisition costs as well as customer retention costs," Canaves said. And as Trump delayed the TikTok ban multiple times, the desperate hunt for an alternative lost its urgency. "It is really challenging for new apps to break through," Canaves said. "I think they struggled to scale in the way that they wanted to." Flip wrote on its website last month that its mission of building a "social platform that gave everyone a voice" had come to a close. It said it had reached 16.5 million people, crossed 5 billion video views, paid $13.4 million to creators, and driven $375 million in sales for brands. The statement didn't provide a reason for the closure. The app's shuttering caught some brand partners off guard. Haak Wear, a hat seller, addressed the Flip shutdown in a blog post on its website. "This situation has reminded us of the importance of having multiple touchpoints with our community," the company wrote. Five former staffers said they felt out of the loop on the health of the business while working at Flip. Flip is not the only tech platform to make big promises to partners and then shut its doors. Buzzy shopping app Nate abruptly closed its creator program in December 2022, for example. "It wasn't surprising that the app was going to shut down at some point," said Tara Blair Ball, a creator in Flip's Founding Creator Fund. "I don't think it made sense how they were making money to warrant the pay that they were giving." Even as Flip's downloads were surging in January, Agha acknowledged that merging social media with commerce is challenging in the US market. "It's definitely crazy freaking hard," Agha said during the January interview. "Almost killed us a thousand times. No question." Have a tip?

Title: 'Bond King' Bill Gross says he's worried AI giants are wasting money — and their stocks could pay the price

US tech titans are spending huge sums to win the AI race — and the ones that lose could see their stock prices take a hit, "Bond King" Bill Gross has warned. The billionaire investor gave his thoughts to Business Insider after Oracle's market value surged by as much as 43%, or nearly $300 billion, on Wednesday, thanks to an AI-driven revenue projection. "My biggest concern is what economists refer to as 'malinvestment,' Gross said in an email. Gross — who cofounded the fixed-income titan PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades — said the tech giants are racing to dominate various AI sectors and "seem willing to risk over-investment in hopes of future monopolies." "Some will fail and current trends — and stock prices based on them — may experience significantly reduced growth," Gross said. He singled out AI data centers and the "hundreds of billions" being spent on them by companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Electricity providers are also "gearing up to supply them," he added. AI companies are investing vast sums in microchips, servers, and other infrastructure they need to build and train increasingly advanced models and harness AI in other ways. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are poised to invest more than $300 billion into AI this year. The immense buzz around AI has lit a fire under tech stocks. Shares of the nine most valuable tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Tesla, and Oracle — have all more than doubled since the start of 2023, with Nvidia surging about 12-fold and Meta leaping around six-fold. The group's combined market value now exceeds $22 trillion. Jump to

Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.wdun44ema Share article Print article Just for a moment this week, Larry Ellison, co-founder of US cloud computing company Oracle, became the world’s richest person. The octogenarian tech titan briefly overtook Elon Musk after Oracle’s share price rocketed 43% in a day, adding about US$100 billion (A$150 billion) to his wealth. The reason? Oracle inked a deal to provide artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI with US$300 billion (A$450 billion) in computing power over five years. While Ellison’s moment in the spotlight was fleeting, it also illuminated something far more significant: AI has created extraordinary levels of concentration in global financial markets. This raises an uncomfortable question not only for seasoned investors – but also for everyday Australians who hold shares in AI companies via their superannuation. Just how exposed are even our supposedly “safe”, “diversified” investments to the AI boom? As billionaires go, Ellison isn’t as much of a household name as Tesla and SpaceX’s Musk or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. But he’s been building wealth from enterprise technology for nearly five decades. Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977, transforming it into one of the world’s largest database software companies. For decades, Oracle provided the unglamorous but essential plumbing that kept many corporate systems running. The AI revolution changed everything. Oracle’s cloud computing infrastructure, which helps companies store and process vast amounts of data, became critical infrastructure for the AI boom. Every time a company wants to train large language models or run machine learning algorithms, they need huge amounts of computing power and data storage. That’s precisely where Oracle excels. When Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings this week, driven largely by soaring AI demand, its share price spiked. That response wasn’t just about Oracle’s business fundamentals. It was about the entire AI ecosystem that has been reshaping global markets since ChatGPT’s public debut in late 2022. Oracle’s story is part of a much larger phenomenon reshaping global markets. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – now control an unprecedented share of major stock indices. Year-to-date in 2025, these seven companies have come to represent approximately 39% of the US S&P500’s total value. For the tech-heavy NASDAQ100, the figure is a whopping 74%. This means if you invest in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P500 index, often considered the gold standard of diversified investing, you’re making an increasingly concentrated bet on AI, whether you realise it or not. This level of concentration has not been seen since the late 1990s. Back then, investors were swept up in “dot-com mania”, driving technology stock prices to unsustainable levels. When reality finally hit in March 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq crashed 77% over two years, wiping out trillions in wealth. Today’s AI concentration raises some similar red flags. Nvidia, which controls an estimated 90% of the AI chip market, currently trades at more than 30 times expected earnings. This is expensive for any stock, let alone one carrying the hopes of an entire technological revolution. Yet, unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are profitable companies with real revenue streams. Microsoft, Apple and Google aren’t cash-burning startups. They are established giants, using AI to enhance existing businesses while generating substantial profits. This makes the current situation more complicated than a simple “bubble” comparison. The academic literature on market bubbles suggests genuine technological innovation often coincides with speculative excess. The question isn’t whether AI is transformative; it clearly is. Rather, the question is whether current valuations reflect realistic expectations about future profitability. For Australians, the AI concentration problem hits remarkably close to home through our superannuation system. Many balanced super fund options include substantial allocations to international shares, typically 20–30% of their portfolios. When your super fund buys international shares, it’s often getting heavy exposure to those same AI giants dominating US markets. The concentration risk extends beyond direct investments in tech companies. Australian mining companies, such as BHP and Fortescue, have become indirect AI players because their copper, lithium and rare earth minerals are essential for AI infrastructure. Even diversifying away from technology doesn’t fully escape AI-related risks. Research on portfolio concentration shows when major indices become dominated by a few large stocks, the benefits of diversification diminish significantly. If AI stocks experience a significant correction or crash, it could disproportionately impact Australians’ retirement nest eggs. This situation represents what’s called “systemic concentration risk”. This is a specific form of systemic risk where supposedly diversified investments become correlated through common underlying factors or exposures. It’s reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, when seemingly separate housing markets across different regions all collapsed simultaneously. That was because they were all exposed to subprime mortgages with high risk of default. This does not mean anyone should panic. But regulators, super fund trustees and individual investors should all be aware of these risks. Diversification only works if returns come from a broad range of companies and industries.

Title: XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano Could Lead Explosive Altcoin Rally, Analyst Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets are “on the edge” of a broad altcoin breakout, with XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano positioned to lead, according to technical strategist CryptoInsightUK. In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

Become a Member for as little as $4/mo and enjoy unlimited reading of TSLL blog. Bursting at the seams in all the right ways. We’ve got books – fiction, cookbooks, inspired by French history, hopeful books, health books and more. Films for Anglophiles and films for family reconciliation, returning favorite television dramas with engaging leading ladies, clothes – oh my! – to continue to polish your autumn wardrobe – loafers, sweaters, totes and still there is more. Did I mention there is a must-see exhibit in London to check out? Yep, that too! Art —Marie Antoinette Style exhibit at Victoria & Albert Museum, London If you will be in London between September 20th through March 22nd of 2026, and if Marie Antoinette’s style piques your interest, be sure to put a visit to the Victoria & Albert Museum on your itinerary. The Maria Antoinette Style exhibit centers around the “complex fashion icon, Marie Antoinette’s timeless appeal, [ever so much] defined by her style, youth and notoriety. Explore the lasting influence of the most fashionable (and ill-fated) queen in history – with over 250 years of design, fashion, film and art.” Books —Beyond Blue and White: The Hidden History of Delftware and the Women Behind the Iconic Ceramic by Genevieve Wheeler Brown Delft anything. Vases, tiles, bowls, you name it, most of us can identify these beautiful pieces when we see them, but where did it all begin and how did they become iconic? And more interestingly, who are the women that were part of the history that made it so? All of this is the focus of Genevieve Wheeler Brown’s new book Beyond Blue and White. Having read a recent review in the WSJ, and being fortunate to have found a Delft vase that I now regularly use and love, I always love learning more about the history of items that catch my eye, and Delftware is one of them. In the book you will “meet female Delftware makers, including Barbara Rotteveel founder of ‘The Three Bells’ Delftware factory in 1671, be introduced to female Delftware patrons such as Queen Mary II, who found her means of expression while creating a vogue in the 17th century for Delft blue and white across royal courts. And then there are the female collectors beginning in the 19th century who saw the artistry and craft in these ceramics others had overlooked. Foremost among them was Mrs. J. Pierpont Morgan and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II who came together with fellow New York women and laid the groundwork for women in the museum world while preserving decorative arts with an educational mission.” “What begins as a curatorial exercise quickly evolves not only into an exploration of this colorful, expressive, and sometimes even humorous decorative art, coveted for hundreds of years, but also an unexpected uncovering of forceful female lives yet untold.” —Books: A Manifesto, Or, How to Build a Library by Ian Patterson Looking forward to getting my hands on this one and adding it to my library, and if you too are a fellow bibliophile, this is a book for you! Currently only available in the UK (ship to the US from Blackwells), Books: A Manifesto, or How to Build a Library is “Wise, irreverent and exhilaratingly wide-ranging” Ian Patterson “insists on reading not as a luxury but a necessary part of reality: we live within language, and when we think, it’s with the tools that reading gives us.” “Our time of cultural and political crisis demands more than books – but without them, and without the breadth of knowledge, sense of history, awareness of alternatives and hope for the future they offer, things will not get better. At once a primer for enriching your own library and a manifesto for why that matters, this book is an invitation to a deeper, richer world of thought and feeling – and a reminder of just how much books matter.” Just released yesterday on September 11th, you can find it available to ship now from Blackwells. —History Matters by David McCullough A book about and written by one of the bestselling historians of the 20th and early 21st century, History Matters, released on Tuesday the 16th, is a posthumous collection of thought-provoking essays—many never published before—[from] Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and author David McCullough affirms the value of history, how we can be guided by its lessons, and the enduring legacy of American ideals.” “Edited by McCullough’s daughter, Dorie McCullough Lawson, and his longtime researcher, Michael Hill, History Matters is a tribute to a master historian and offers fresh insights into McCullough’s enduring interests and writing life. McCullough highlights the importance of character in political leaders, with Harry Truman and George Washington serving as exemplars of American values like optimism and determination. He shares his early influences, from the books he cherished in his youth to the people who mentored him. He also pays homage to those who inspired him, such as writer Paul Horgan and painter Thomas Eakins, illustrating the diverse influences on his writing as well as the influence of art.” To be released on September 16th One of my favorite titles by McCullough was The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris —Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki Released earlier this month, and a book determined to demonstrate how the less we know and take at face value – headlines, screaming viral social media moments, you get the idea – the more we can buy the hype of hopelessness. Thankfully, Hope for Cynics argues that “we don’t have to remain stuck in this cynicism trap. Through science and storytelling, Jamil Zaki imparts the secret for beating back cynicism: hopeful skepticism—thinking critically about people and our problems, while honoring and encouraging our strengths. Far from being naïve, hopeful skepticism is a precise way of understanding others that can rebalance our view of human nature and help us build the world we truly want.” I am here for it. Thank you Zaki for writing this book. —No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce by Haley Mlotek While listening to book recommendations from the staff of NPR as they shared what they read and enjoyed this summer, Haley Mletek’s memoir sounded intriguing. No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce was inspired by the author’s own navigation through divorce and comes at this often talked about subject in a different way. Released back in February, Mlotek “combines her personal story while searching social and literary exploration [to share] a deeply felt and radiant account of 21st century divorce—the remarkably common and seemingly singular experience, and what it reveals about our society and our desires for family, love, and friendship. Mlotek asks profound questions about what divorce should be, who it is for, and why the institution of marriage maintains its power, all while charting a poignant and cathartic journey away from her own marriage towards an unknown future.” —Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body by Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D From the podcaster behind Huberman Lab, and neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Huberman “introduces Protocols, an essential guide to improving brain function, enhancing mood and energy, optimizing bodily health and physical performance, and rewiring your nervous system to learn new skills and behaviors that can transform your life.” Being released next Tuesday, “Protocols provides simple, powerful, and evidence-based solutions to life’s most common challenges. Designed to improve your mental health, physical health, and performance, these guidelines are customizable, allowing you to adapt them to your specific needs. With his clear and engaging style, Dr. Huberman explains the scientific principles behind each protocol and how they can deliver immediate, effective results.” British Finds —Barbour x Tuckernuck collection Tuckernuck has partnered up with a favorite long-standing British brand, Barbour, to come up with a collection of quite a few good items for the autumn wardrobe. Loving the scarves, the travel umbrella, and there are a few classic quilted Barbour coats to peek at was well. Don’t forget about the sweaters and button-ups. I have shopped a few below in the scroll. —SHOP THE COLLECTION: —Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale It’s here folks. Both absolutely beyond eager to watch, and yet, reticent as well. Reviewers are in agreement that the finale will please fans – read NYTimes review here, Daily Beast and AP, with The Guardian is skeptical this film will really be the true finale of the Crawleys. And at some point this weekend, I will be watching it in the theater where it deserves to be watched. If you too will be joining the throng of crowds, I hope you enjoy the two hours of this captivating family’s story we’ve been watching since September 2010. Watch an official clip from the film about why Lady Mary’s divorce occurred that begins the film. Cookbooks —Abundance: Stories and Recipes from a Gardening Cook by Mark Diacono Only available in the UK (but you can have it shipped to the US from Blackwells), Abundance: Eating And Living with the Seasons from cook and gardener Mark Diacono looks delicious both in its approach and in its ideas. “With his days distracted by the ping of communication and the tug of commitments, Mark Diacono wondered how he might better savour this one precious life. He started to write and photograph each week, hoping that this simple commitment might sharpen his appreciation of the magic in the everyday and his time spent in the kitchen. It reminds us that abundance comes in many forms – the passing of the seasons, our connection to the world around us, and the wealth that a garden, a town and its surrounding landscapes offers. “With over 80 recipes like Early summer shakshuka, Salsify and radicchio gratin, Onion seed and oregano flower focaccia, Fig leaf and olive oil ice cream, and a Mulberry martini, there are dishes to inspire and satisfy every week as the year unfolds before you.” —Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love by Samin Nosrat Long awaited from international bestselling cookbook author and star of the Netflix series inspired by the book, Samin Nosrat’s new book Good Things will be released on Tuesday. Described as ” an essential, joyful guide to cooking and living, whether you’re looking for a comforting tomato soup to console a struggling friend, seeking a deeper sense of connection in your life, or hosting a dinner for ten in your too-small dining room. Here you’ll find go-to recipes for ricotta custard pancakes, a showstopping roast chicken burnished with saffron, a crunchy, tingly Calabrian chili crisp, super-chewy sky-high focaccia, and a decades-in-the-making, childhood-evoking yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Along the way, you’ll also find plenty of tips, techniques, and lessons, from how to buy olive oil (check the harvest date) to when to splurge (salad dressing is where you want to use your best ingredients) to the best uses for your pressure cooker (chicken stock and dulce de leche, naturally).” “Enjoy 125 meticulously tested, flavor-forward, soul-nourishing recipes that bring joy and a sense of communion.” Film —Looking Through Water Almost immediately, this new film, starring Michael Douglas and his son, reminded me of On Golden Pond where another real-life parent and child take to the screen to tell a familiar story of healing. Looking Through Water will premiere this weekend in select theaters and tells the story of a father’s attempt to reconnect with his estranged son, doing so by inviting him to compete in a father-son fishing competition.” Have a look at the trailer below. Francophile Finds —French Country Crocks New to the shop at Farm House Pottery from Farmhouse Pottery fromVivi et Margot are French Country Crocks drawing inspiration from “the charm of the French countryside blended with Vermont’s artisanal spirit. These handmade crocks, available in two distinct stoneware finishes, reflect the calming hues of nature and the timeless art of wheel-thrown pottery. Perfect for any kitchen looking to add a touch of rustic beauty, each crock is designed to be a treasured piece in your home, blending form and function for generations to come.” —Van Gogh’s Lover: A Novel by Michael Hetzer I want to first begin by thanking TSLL long-time reader and member Christine for recommending this book to our community. Knowing that art and of course France are frequent subjects of interest, this title is definitely one I think many will enjoy. Released eaerlier this year, Van Gogh’s Lover is inspired by the true story of Vincent Van Gogh’s years in France. The plot begins twelve years after “a high school accident derailed Jane’s once-promising future. When the owners of the powerful Firth Gallery invite Jane to bring her beloved family painting, The Lover, to Switzerland, it looks like a second chance. But on her first night in Geneva, the painting goes missing, and she suspects the Firths.” “Determined to recover her painting, Jane is led to a dying village in the high Alps where an enigmatic man living in a château is waiting for her. Within the château’s walls, she uncovers a history of lies, murder, and, at its heart, an appalling injustice that will shake the art world to its core.” “But not everyone wants these facts brought to light. Jane will need to find the strength she lost in her accident and face the shocking truth about her past, her painting, and, finally, an epic love affair between a destitute painter named Vincent Van Gogh and a mysterious woman who inspired a portrait that may be his greatest work.” Shopping —Banana Republic’s Friends & Family Event, 40% off full priced purchase Beginning today (12th) and running through the 21st, enjoy 40% off any full priced purchase. Yep, including the new arrivals. I have shopped a few items below to get us started. ~SHOP THE SALE: —Flattered Bon Bon Leather and Suede Loafers, many colors While putting the finishing touches on TSLL’s forthcoming 4th book, which will include a reference to the four seasons and wardrobe must-haves (along with many other seasonal sharings and life inspiration), I also made sure to include brands worth investing in. Enter à la Flattered. Their loafers offer supple leather, a streamlined style, and classic design and colors. Recommended by a variety of top fashion editors, if you are on the hunt for a pair of loafers, you have just found them. —Kaai’s Pyramid tote, many colors Another quality purchase – Kaai’s Pyramid tote. If you are a frequent traveler carrying oodles of items in your tote, or when you head to work each day, you carry your life with you, the Pyramid tote has a spot for just about everything so you can easily find what you are looking for. I learned about this brand while reading the article “Can a bag make you more organized?”[FT.com, gift link], and quickly wanted to know the answer to the posed question. —Me + Em’s White Nautical Stripe Relaxed Forever Shirt A classic with a touch of modern subtle style. —RSVP Paris’s Parachute medium tote, cognac (more colors and different sizes) One more tote that while an investment, if it is your style, will be a trusted and dependable tote for many years to come. The subtle slouch totes are quite popular at the moment, and so long as they provide the structure and the storage paired with comfort to swing over your shoulder, I will take note. RSVP Paris’ parachute appears to check all the boxes. —Varley’s Enrico Knit Jacket, three colors available Autumn is for all intents and purposes, has technically arrived here in Bend, and this knit jacket with flattering collar (and thus warmth when needed but only when needed) with its zipped front looks to be a go-to item to elevate a casual outfit. —Varley’s Tomlinson Belted Long Coat This coat has been getting a lot of buzz as of late, and for good reason. For fewer than $500, a timeless houndstooth (puppytooth, technically) long coat. Not a bad price if it fits your silhouette, and I think it just might fit even thos of us who are tall! Made with double-faced, unlined Melton fabric, it would be a wonderful autumn coat as we transition from cool to colder temps. —Vince scarves, various fabrics Light cotton gauze or sheer wool fabric, the simple color choices to flatter your skin tone, choose a solid or a stripe, and this accessory will be with you for years. Television —77th Primetime Emmy Awards, CBS When the Primetime Emmy Award show arrives, we know that the fall season on television is about to kick off officially. And on Sunday at 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern), the 77th annual show takes place. Cue the premieres of just about every returning and new show to begin in the days and weeks to come. —High Potential, season 2 (US version) ABC/Hulu Speaking of which, the mystery series adapted from the original French series HPI (Haut Potentiel Intellectuel) – which by the way you can watch on Hulu as well!, is returning for a second season. High Potential premieres Tuesday September 16th on ABC/Hulu. Having watched a the latest season (4th) of the French version (there are five seasons so far – the fifth is being developed right now), I am curious to know if the American version will follow the same storyline for its main characters. We will see! We will see! Have a look at the trailer below. —The Morning Show, season 4 – AppleTV+ And after two years, The Morning Show is back! And boy, does it look to be high drama scene after scene! Whoa! This year Marion Cottilard and William Jackson Harper join the season for a couple of episodes and Jeremy Irons stars in season 4 as Alex Levy’s (Jennifer Aniston’s) father. Wednesday evenings are booked! Have a look at the trailer below and enjoy 10 episodes, taking us all the way to middle of November. The rain came, continued to fall, gushed, created temporary ponds in the roads and roundabouts, then Mother Nature gave us a day of sunshine before cuing the rain’s return. As many will have guessed, the happy dances at Le Papillon were in full swing! So happy am I that we are now tuckered as Nelle demonstrates above. But tuckered in a very good way ☺️. With the weather as it was, the encouragement to stay inside after our walks, meant quite a bit of work occurred on the fourth book, and as I put in the last few sections that after two months away from the book this summer, I realized the book would absolutely do well to have, we’re getting close to done. And that feels amazing. 😌 Last weekend a new family member for the garden was planted, a tree I thought I would have to wait until spring to plant, but it sort of plopped into my lap and I couldn’t say no. I will be sure to share exactly what and where it is in the Garden post later this month, and TOP Tier members can look for the monthly Ponderings . . . post to be shared this weekend. We will be talking about all sorts of stuff including the beginning steps on the Guest Bedroom project. Now that the peaches have been made into jam after sharing the rest with the neighbors, weekends shift away from garden projects (although soon, soon! the cottage gate will be installed!) and into home and life projects which coordinates well with the seasonal shift. Wearing my first scarf on a walk this week, the Outfits of the Month post is full of five outfits taking inspiration from the British while we bring on the layers for fall. And on Monday, Part Trois (3) of What Lies at the Heart of Living Simply Luxuriously was shared as we talked about savoring the everyday ‘sides’ of living well. And before I sign off and send you exploring the links below, check out this photo by enrollee of TSLL’s Intro to French Cooking class. Cassandra knocked it out of the park with her Tian de Légumes didn’t she? Yep, included in the Lesson all about “Vegetable Sides as Decadent as a Sauce”, throughout the course, students are encouraged to share what they create, and I so appreciate her sending her pics! I am hungry now ☺️ Keep them coming everyone! And don’t forget that there are 12 more days to save 20% off the regular price of enrollment for active TOP Tier members! Cassandra’s Tian de Légumes! Learn more about TSLL’s Intro to French Cooking: Everyday Deliciousness course here. Thank you for stopping by today and may the weekend ahead be full of scents and sights of the shifting seasons, gratifying aha moments and of course, oodles of everyday moments to savor.

September 11, 2025 20:13 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In Novo To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in Novo between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).
