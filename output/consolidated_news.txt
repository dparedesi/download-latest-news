Share this article After catching heat earlier this year for bull-posting Ethereum ahead of a sharp decline, Eric Trump finally enjoys a turnaround as the coin bounces back nearly 35% from his promo high. Ethereum’s green candles prompted the US president’s son to celebrate. On Monday, Eric posted the iconic “Mic Drop” minion GIF from Despicable Me as he reshared his February post declaring, “It’s a great time to add $ETH.” https://t.co/MaEelzwY2m pic.twitter.com/YJUZ77qFKm — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) July 22, 2025 “Embrace volatility. If you were smart, you would have also bought the dips (as I said to do),” he replied to an X user. The second-largest crypto asset by market value was trading at around $2,800 at the time of Eric’s February call. It later fell to $1,470 in April, its lowest level since November 2023. However, the asset has since rebounded sharply and is now trading above $3,700, up more than 155% from its April low, CoinGecko data shows. Growing institutional demand and corporate accumulation are key drivers behind Ethereum’s recent rally. Moreover, hopes that the SEC will approve staking features for spot Ethereum ETFs, including a proposal from BlackRock, are helping fuel the momentum. Eric also dropped a “revenge” comment on an April post by market analyst Ted Pillows, who had noted that ETH was down 40% since Eric’s tweet.

Despite recent investor disappointment with Q1 results, Reliance Industries (RIL) is poised for significant growth, according to major brokerages. Jio's rising ARPU through tariff hikes, the ambitious new energy business entering execution phase, and the potential Jio IPO are key catalysts. Analysts project substantial value creation, with targets indicating confidence in RIL's transformation.

Title: China’s Cosco Eyes Veto Rights in Deal for Li Ka-shing’s Ports

China’s biggest shipping company is set to join the global consortium that’s acquiring Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s overseas ports, and is requesting a powerful role in the group in order to secure Beijing’s blessing for the controversial deal, people familiar with the matter said. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. is asking to have veto rights or equivalent powers in the entity taking over the 43 ports, including two strategically important ones along the Panama Canal, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. Cosco has argued such rights are necessary to block any decisions that are potentially harmful to China’s interests, the people added. Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and the original buyer group, which includes BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., have agreed that Cosco should have full informational access to the operation, the people said. But talks are still ongoing as to the powers that Cosco will have in the consortium and no final decisions have been made, they said. Read: Chinese Firms in Talks to Join Group for Li Ka-Shing’s Ports A 145-day period for exclusive talks between CK Hutchison and the consortium is likely to lapse on July 27, and details of Cosco’s role in the consortium could be settled by the end of September, some of them said. Cosco didn’t respond to calls and a faxed request for comments. CK Hutchison and the Aponte family’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., which controls Terminal Investment, didn’t respond to separate requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco’s demands mark the latest twist for a deal that’s become a proxy for US-China rivalry, after President Donald Trump painted the transaction as the return of Panama Canal to US influence. Chinese regulators have, for their part, vowed to investigate the transaction, and Li and his family have come under intense scrutiny and criticism. The Hong Kong tycoon’s younger son Richard Li’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to the BlackRock unit.

Title: Morgan Stanley Dismisses Rumors of Apple Acquiring AI Search Firm
URL: https://www.macobserver.com/news/morgan-stanley-dismisses-rumors-of-apple-acquiring-ai-search-firm/
Time Published: 2025-07-22T02:04:01Z
Full Content:
Latest news Morgan Stanley isn’t buying the hype around Apple acquiring a search-based AI firm like Perplexity. While some investors and analysts speculate that an acquisition could help Apple catch up in the AI race, Morgan Stanley sees it as the wrong move and not part of Apple’s playbook. In a note to investors, analyst Erik Woodring called the idea “misguided,” arguing that Apple has no intention of entering the search market. Instead, Apple is developing virtual assistant features using its own large language models and incorporating technology from third-party partners. Woodring added that Apple isn’t trying to compete with Google, Meta, or Amazon in the same way and won’t be delivering major AI-related updates in the September quarter. While AI progress remains gradual, Apple’s core business continues to perform. Morgan Stanley has raised its revenue forecast for Apple’s fiscal Q3 2025 to $90.7 billion, a 5.8% year-over-year increase. Stronger-than-expected iPhone shipments, higher average selling prices, and steady demand for iPads and Macs are driving the growth. In the note, the firm acknowledged investor concerns over the App Store injunction and Apple’s silence on Services guidance in the previous earnings call. But Morgan Stanley isn’t worried. It projects Services revenue will grow 11.6% year-over-year, and expects the App Store alone to match that figure. The analysts believe this will mark the eighth consecutive quarter of Services growth between 10% and 15%. AppleInsider, citing Morgan Stanley’s investor note, echoed the positive sentiment around the upcoming Q3 results. Favorable exchange rates and consistent consumer demand are boosting gains across product categories, according to the firm. It now estimates iPhone performance to exceed consensus by 2%, with iPads and Macs expected to beat earlier projections by 9% and 1% respectively. Morgan Stanley expects growth to slow in the September quarter but still remain positive. He now forecasts $96.5 billion in revenue for that period, up from a previous estimate of $95.7 billion. It also revised earnings per share from $1.56 to $1.61, factoring in dollar tailwinds and improved performance across hardware and Services. Gross margins are forecasted at 46.1%, absorbing $1.5 billion in tariff costs. Despite limited AI updates expected this year, Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Apple’s long-term position in the AI space. The firm does not expect Apple Intelligence to move forward in any meaningful way until after 2026 and sees no near-term progress in China either. Apple won’t be buying its way into the AI search game. Instead, it’s playing the long game with assistant-style features built on its own tech stack. Morgan Stanley still believes in that approach and has maintained its Overweight rating on Apple stock, with a price target of $235 above recent targets from both JPMorgan and HSBC.

Title: Fact Check: Milwaukee Tool is an American Company

ToolGuyd Tool Reviews, New Tool Previews, Best Tool Guides, Tool Deals, and More! Jul 21, 2025 Stuart 89 Comments A frequently repeated mistruth has popped up in the comments section and numerous conversations over the years, and it’s time to once again debunk it. No, Milwaukee Tool is NOT “owned by China.” Here are examples of the misinformation I’ve seen in the comments section here, with similar arguments made in conversations: Advertisement Milwaukee is still owned by the Chinese And does made in the US actually matter if it’s a Chinese company Let’s start at the top. Milwaukee Tool’s parent company is Techtronic Industries, commonly known as TTI. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is listed in the Hong Kong stock exchange. TTI purchased Milwaukee Tool in 2005. Who owns TTI? Well, it’s definitely not China. With TTI being publicly traded, you can look up lists of the major shareholders, which according to various sources include its founders and USA-based institutional investors such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Vanguard. Advertisement YOU can purchase a share of the company. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is based in Hong Kong, and Milwaukee Tool is an independent subsidiary that is based in the United States. I often encounter “yes, but” arguments where red herrings and other fallacies muddy the discussion. I have also had many conversations about this topic over the years where the result is “oh, I didn’t know that!” From everything I’ve seen, Milwaukee Tool operates as if it were an independent American company, and one that is committed to American job creation and USA manufacturing expansion. Let’s dig into that a little, as most people don’t know much about that side of the company. Milwaukee Tool is headquartered in the USA. I’ve been to their offices, R&D facilities, test labs, as well as several of their USA manufacturing centers, and it has been evident that the company is steadily growing. I’ve seen their battery cell test lab, their hand tool quality assurance lab, rooms where they test in-progress designs, the machine shop where they can build rapid prototypes, their power tool accessories test and development center, and more. Also see: Milwaukee Tool Rapid Prototyping Shops – Where the Magic Happens. Benjamen visited one of Milwaukee’s power tool accessories factories a while back: Milwaukee USA Factory Tour: How a Typical Sawzall Blade is Made. He also saw how their hole saws are made: How Milwaukee Hole Saws are Made. And their carbide-tooth blades: How it’s Made (in the USA): Milwaukee Carbide-Toothed Sawzall AX Blade. I visited the revamped Empire Level factory, and Milwaukee’s new USA hand tool factory when it first launched. All of these locations are in the USA. In 2017, Steven Richman, then President of Milwaukee Tool, pledged the creation of more USA jobs and expanded USA manufacturing. He made good on that promise. Last year, Steven Richman became CEO of TTI. In 2020, Milwaukee announced USA-made hand tools. They opened the new hand tools factory in 2023, where the tools are made using USA-sourced materials. Late last year Milwaukee announced additional USA expansion: Milwaukee Tool Opens New USA Factory in Mississippi. On top of the newer electrical screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters, Milwaukee also produces select power tools in the USA, Sawzall reciprocating saw blades, hole saws, hard hats, select hammers (via Stiletto), select squares and layout tools (via their own brand and Empire), and additional power tool accessories. In October, Milwaukee said that their USA workforce has grown to over 10,000, and that they invested $675 million in USA expansion projects. They invested more than $250 million over the past few years in Mississippi. I asked Milwaukee Tool for some recent numbers, and they provided the following: They now have 18 facilities in the USA, mainly research, development, and manufacturing, and have invested $1.8 Billion in USA expansion efforts in the last decade. They estimate that their investment has led to over $11 Billion in economic impact in the last decade. Milwaukee says they invest over $10 Million annually towards driving growth in skilled trades, and have committed to invest another $200 Million by 2030. In the past 5 years, Milwaukee expanded its USA footprint by 5.4 million square feet and added 4,000 American jobs. How many construction jobs do they support with their regular expansion projects? Look at their job board. Milwaukee currently has openings at 15 locations, including positions in manufacturing, engineering, and operations. Here are some of their recent full time postings: Few people think about what Milwaukee Tool actually does here, and it’s actually a lot. A lot of people get confused about all the nuances, and it’s easy to see why – things get messy with global corporations, whether publicly or privately owned. Last year a Canadian company bought USA drill bit brands from a Chinese company. Those are American brands that were owned by a company based in China and now a company based in Canada. KKR, a USA-based private investment firm, owns Metabo (headquartered in German) and Metabo HPT (formerly Hitachi). Would anyone argue that either are American companies? Festool’s parent company is based in Germany and owns SawStop, which is based in the USA. So what does that mean about SawStop? A UK-based private equity firm now owns Malco Tools, which is based in the USA. Milwaukee Tool’s parent company is publicly traded, with major shareholders including US investment firms, and the company itself is based in the USA. Is it relevant where its global parent company has its head offices? If TTI moved their headquarters to a different country, would that change Milwaukee Tool’s operations in any meaningful way? From everything I’ve seen and understand, the answer is no. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is based in Hong Kong, and Milwaukee Tool is an independent subsidiary that is based in the United States. That’s as simple as things can be described without losing accuracy. Jane loves knitting. John loves Jane. Therefore, does John love knitting? No. If you were born and raised in California and then adopted by parents who live in Texas, but you still live in California, are you a Californian, or a Texan? Some have tried to argue that since Hong Kong is part of China, TTI is technically based in China, and thus Milwaukee as part of TTI is a Chinese company. This is a logical fallacy that results in false conclusions. Milwaukee is an American tool brand that seems more committed to job creation and USA production expansion than other tool brands. This is something we can argue about. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is based in Hong Kong, and Milwaukee Tool is an independent subsidiary that is based in the United States. These are facts. Sections: Editorial More from: Milwaukee Hon Cho 1 day ago Gotta ask, does ToolGuyd have a financial relationship with Milwaukee or TTI? I believe I recall you mentioning some sort of support from DeWalt (a SBD brand, not TTI) in the past. I assume that if you have a financial relationship with TTI or Milwaukee you would disclose it. There are an awful lot of political elements to the discussion of American vs foreign control and ownership of businesses. The current political environment is beyond the scope of your discussion of TTI / Milwaukee, but it looms large in the general discussion of what is an American business. Stuart 1 day ago Milwaukee is an advertiser (set-and-forget banner spot, NOT content sponsor), but not TTI (Ryobi, Ridgid at HD, Hart). SBD has been a repeat sponsor. You’ll see disclosures for content sponsorship and “advertisement” labels adjacent to most direct-buy ads. I’ve been pushing back on these sensationalist mistruths for a while. For example: https://toolguyd.com/dewalt-flexvolt-plus-new-20v-max-tools/#comment-802998 Somebody at Milwaukee’s headquarters, in China IT’S IN WISCONSIN. I’ve been there and seen with my own eyes that it’s not just a suite in a business center. https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-cordless-power-tool-battery-tech-2022/#comment-1434010 Here are some earlier ones: 2012: https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-new-product-media-event-2012-recap/#comments 2016: https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-questions-2016/#comment-776525 Bring their headquarters back from China. Some of these are from the same person, even after they were corrected multiple times. I noticed that you said Dewalt was owned by a different company. At one point I felt it necessary to clear that up in a post as well. https://toolguyd.com/dewalt-milwaukee-tool-not-the-same-company/ And about HF and Snap-on not being the same company: https://toolguyd.com/does-harbor-freight-own-snap-on-tools/ I was on the phone with an industry friend recently, and after a new Milwaukee tool came up they said something like “you know, they’re owned by China.” I told them that TTI is publicly traded on the HK stock exchange and they fact-checked it in real time. This has become an incessant myth. skfarmer 1 day ago 2 companies i refuse to buy from. milwaukee and tekton.. i just don’t like em. i take abuse for it but i just don’t like how they operate. i don’t hassle people who like em and and i expect the same. Josh 1 day ago I dont think I own any tekton I know I’ve bought some in the past for new techs as part of their signing bonus though. Seemed ok, what’s your issue with them? I feel the same about Milwaukee, being in the auto tech world I was an early adopter but I’ve had a lot of quality issues with the m18 line. I still have my m12 light, 3/8 impact, impact driver and caulk gun that are all about 12 or more years old but those were my last purchases and I have all my M18 stuff away. Mike 11 hours ago “i just don’t like how they operate” They don’t have a reason other than “vibes”. StopMike 9 hours ago Do they need one other than “vibes”? You have detailed explanations for everything you don’t like? Nope, I can tell by your response . Not to mention they literally explained themselves just like you quoted. skfarmer 9 hours ago i am a farmer and have worked in various trades. hvac install and repair, home appliance repair and delivery, grain elevator repair and maintenance, as well as being certified in heavy extrication with my local fire dept. as well as any and all things being a farmer and homeowner can entail. i do not like milwaukee power tools and their ergonomics. i also don’t care for most of their hand tool designs such as socket shape and handle shape. to me, tekton is nothing more than warmed over michigan industrial tools. i want nothing to do with them. as far as their us mfg. let me know when stuart or anyone else has seen their mfg facilities. someone makes it but it sure as hell isn’t tekton. if you want the pliers,, punches, chisels and pry bars, go to wilde and skip the middle man. at least milwaukee is actually proud of their us made stuff, where it is made and who makes it. i will give them that. does that explain the vibes i have mike? they are good enough reasons for me to spend my money elsewhere and not follow the herd. i truly do not like how either company operate and the tools they offer. i think you poking at me for having an opinion you may or may not agree with shows little or no class. Josh 7 hours ago Thank you for taking the time to respond. All good enough reasons for me I was just curious. Agreed on the Milwaukee ergonomics, I get hot spots Olin the webbing of my thumb/finger running a Milwaukee all day. No such issue with my Festool or even Bosch drivers. Big complaint about Busch impacts though is 2 handed bit insertion. Pull ring bank insert bit. Everyone else you just push the bit in and it snaps in place. I actually gave my Bosch one away TomD 2 hours ago Milwaukee especially the M12 really needs the big ham hands; having the battery inside the handle is a huge difference unless you have catcher’s mitts for paws. Luckily, I do, and so I can join the Red Army. What I don’t like is I can’t figure out the deal with them vs that hand truck company. Josh 1 day ago This feels awfully propaganda-ey You left out the factory closures you covered right here on the page, that’s weird. Andrew Holmes 1 day ago Are you talking about the craftsman factory closures? There’s not been an article about Milwaukee closing buildings recently just about them opening them. Stuart 1 day ago Milwaukee did NOT close their hand tool factory, and recently launched new cutters that are made there – https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-angled-diagonal-cutting-pliers-launch/ . Josh 1 day ago Didn’t they close a Mississippi factory a shortly after opening it? Pretty sure you covered it Stuart 1 day ago Ah – that one closed 2-1/2 years ago – https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-tool-clinton-mississippi-closure-2023/ At the time they said that 150 workers were impacted. They were expecting to create 800 new jobs at another facility that was also being expanded – https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-usa-manufacturing-expansion-2022/ . A lot of brands had closures and layoffs around the same time. https://toolguyd.com/stanley-black-decker-closing-facility-south-carolina-2024/ https://toolguyd.com/makita-usa-layoffs-2023/ Closures suck. I tend to look at net increases and investments, especially as they compare across the industry. Scott 1 day ago Might have been easier to keep manufacturing here, rather than ship it all overseas, then start making a few things here and say that your expanding American manufacturing. Stuart 1 day ago Modern cordless power tools were never made here. Even when SBD was assembling select cordless power tools here, key components were imported. https://toolguyd.com/dewalt-built-cordless-drills-in-usa/ Milwaukee Tool only launched hand tools under TTI ownership, and I doubt they would have seen much demand for USA-made tools at the time, let alone been able to build manufacturing from scratch. Half of SBD was a hand tools company and yet they couldn’t manage to successfully build a new production facility. Klein Tools makes a lot of hand tools in the USA but chose to outsource most of their expansion efforts. New jobs and new knowhow is better than nothing. Ask a company like Crescent about when they’re bringing back USA production. Leatherman just launched new USA-made knives, and all anyone is talking about are the prices. I appreciate what USA production we can get, because these days it isn’t much. Scott 10 hours ago But their corded tools have been offshore as well. I just was at my local Ace, and both the corded sawzall and super sawzall say made in China on them. (I do have pics to prove it). Their harbors for holes also use to be made in USA, now they’re imported too. My point was the stuff they used to make in the U S they shipped over seas. If I made 100% of my products in the U.S., then shipped everything overseas, then decided to expand domestic manufacturing by making 1 product in the U.S., that seems like … I don’t know… not honest to me Stuart 10 hours ago Can you send me pics (email, imgur, or social media)? The last I checked I was told they’re still made here. I wouldn’t be too surprised, as the market for corded tools keeps shrinking. I don’t know about arbors, just the hole saw cups. Bonnie 10 hours ago ACME Tools lists their COO as China as well. https://www.acmetools.com/milwaukee-m18-fuel-super-sawzall-bare-tool-2722-20/045242006465.html Going through their holesaws on Acme’s website it looks like the Hole-Dozers are still USA made, but the diamond and shockwave branded ones are all from Taiwan, and the arbors are Chinese. https://www.acmetools.com/milwaukee-7-16-in-large-thread-quick-change-arbor-49-56-9100/045242200832.html https://www.acmetools.com/milwaukee-shockwave-impact-hole-saw-3-piece-set-49-22-4800/045242321162.html Stuart 10 hours ago We’re talking about corded/AC powered, not M18. And standard hole saws, such as this 28pc set at Home Depot, not the couple of impact ones. HD shows individual with-arbor sizes as being made in USA with global materials. You’d have to check the packaging on the arbors to know for certain. Scott 10 hours ago Sent via email Stuart 8 hours ago @Scott, I got it, thanks! Darn I was hoping you weren’t right. I took the corded Sawzall part out, as your images clearly show it being labeled as made in China. They do still produce some power tools here, such as the compact Packout vacuum (again, as of the last time I checked). I ask around regularly, and tool brands are not at all interested in making cordless power tools here. Matt 1 day ago I appreciate this type of article as I was definitely hearing one-sided perspectives that were misleading / confusing. Propaganda and opinions aside, it’s refreshing to read discussions that remind the reader of logical fallacies, muddy semantics and context. All conecepts that are vastly important for a proper discussion. I love tools, especially when they are pushing the edge of market competition for the right intentions. I like to believe Milwaukee, Dewalt, Ryobi, Metabo, Klein, Proto, Snap-On, Craftsman, etc all have/had their niche lane of expertise. Then market share or share holder demands gets the best of every for-profit company. Its how we end up with battery and plastic storage box wars. One humble tool enthusiast just hopes that the competition leads to lower prices while also improving the everyday lifestyles of the neighborhood. For some the neighborhood is as small as a few blocks; for some the neighborhood is as big as continents! Chris D 24 hours ago I’m confused about the purpose of the article. Being an independent subsidiary means they are controlled and influenced by the parent company. That’s how this kind of ownership structure works. TTI being publicly traded does not change the fact that they are a Hong Kong-based (Chinese) company. So Milwaukee, at the top level, is owned, influenced, and controlled by a Chinese-based company, TTI. It’s a fact, and I can’t see how it’s in dispute. I’m purposely avoiding making a value judgement about whether or not this ownership arrangement is a “good” thing, and am not drawing the “false” conclusions you caution about in the article. I’m only reacting to the fact check. I can’t tell if you’re either trying to inform that they are not directly owned by the Chinese government, or if you’re trying to add some separation between Milwaukee and the country of their owner for some patriotic help for the brand, or if you are trying to inform that you know TTI has absolutely no influence on Milwaukee. Either way, I will still be buying M12 tools and other products. I just think this was a bit of a strange article. Stuart 22 hours ago The purpose of this article is for me to not have to repeat the same info every time there’s a claim of “Milwaukee is owned by China!” in the comments section. Given the nature of the comments I have seen over and over again, it seems a lot of people mistakenly believe that Milwaukee is just a name for an overseas company, or that they are somehow directly owned by the Chinese government. Frequently, after erroneously saying something about the location of Milwaukee’s HQ, some will say something like “yes, but don’t they send all of the profits back to China?” Frankly, no one can trace where every dollar ends up, but we do know that Milwaukee is constantly investing in jobs and expansion here, which makes that easy to debunk. Ed 12 hours ago People conflate Milwaukee HQ with that of TTI. It’s lazy and low-information, but that’s the reality of it. Sinclaire 11 hours ago Appreciate the thoughtful article. As you’ve said the question of ownership here is somewhat muddled so I’m sure your detailed explanation has helped clear that up. One of my recent comments is quoted so figured I might as well respond. It wasn’t entirely accurate for me to refer to Milwaukee as a “Chinese company” but it wouldn’t be entirely accurate to refer to it as an American company either. Personally I’ve heard lots of comments on other sites as well as on job sites to the effect of “I buy Milwaukee because it’s an American company and they’re made in the US.” Speaking about power tools usually. I find these comments annoying since they’re patently incorrect and usually made by someone who would scoff at anything Made in China. So, my comment on a previous article wasn’t exactly accurate but stemmed mostly from my annoyance at other misconceptions about Milwaukee. It wasn’t intended as a value judgement either, and Milwaukee’s efforts to increase manufacturing, especially in a state desperate for an economic boost like Mississippi, are extremely laudable. The only thing in this article I would push back on (as others have here) is the notion that TTI being publicly traded somehow means it isn’t a Chinese company. US firms invest in tons of Chinese companies, that doesn’t make them any less Chinese. Stuart 10 hours ago The problem with misinformation is that it’s easy to pick up and repeat, and harder to fact check. I’ve had to correct people who thought Milwaukee is its own company or that they produce everything here. But the “their HQ is in China” and similar has become more pervasive, and often spread maliciously because people prefer other brands or dislike Milwaukee for whatever reason. I try to address any misinformation or misconceptions in the comments, because you never know if it’ll be read and taken as fact by 100 people or 100,000. TTI being publicly traded is an important detail, because there’s a distinction between a company or their head offices being based in China and being “owned by China.” Skipping details is a shortcut that leads to mistakes being made. CM 21 hours ago Your comment summarized my feelings as well. Additionally, because Milwaukee’s parent company is listed on the HKEX, it isn’t held to the same financial metrics and reporting standards as a company on an American stock exchange, which allows it to operate differently. KokoTheTalkingApe 11 hours ago “Being an independent subsidiary means they are controlled and influenced by the parent company. ” Not necessarily true. The level of control varies, and it’s independent of the legal arrangement between the companies. Some subsidiaries are truly managed independently. Some are just shells that exist in name only so the brand can be licensed out. And as Stuart tried to point out, being “Chinese” isn’t a cut-and-dried thing, at least not when applied to corporations. Neither is “American,” for that matter. What would a 100% American company be? Would they ever buy parts from China? Intellectual property? Raw materials? Could their employees be based in other countries? Could they use foreign contractors? The only truly 100% American tool I’ve ever used is a hard-faced mallet some guy made in his garage, except the aluminum probably came from Canada. The fact is we don’t really have the right words to describe these situations easily. There are shades of gray. And things and complex. And change often. But re Milwaukee, at least some of the money I’d spend goes to American workers, more than a lot of other companies. And the tools are good. That’s good enough for me. Chris D 9 hours ago The level of control varies, you are right, but it’s between 100% control and something greater than 0%. There’s no reasonable chance TTI does not influence Milwaukee. It would be irresponsible to the shareholders to let a subsidiary basically run alone, in a vacuum, and not align it to an overall group strategy to maximize the return. To simplify, if a company is “Chinese” or “American”, etc., just see where their global headquarters is. Microsoft’s is in the US. They are an American company that operates globally with a global supply chain. TTI are a Chinese company that operates globally, with a global supply chain. Whatever is the nationality of the company doesn’t give a value judgement. Sinclaire 7 hours ago I don’t get what’s so hard about this particular point. Headquartered in the US, American company. Headquartered in HK/China, Chinese company. TomD 2 hours ago That’s too simplistic- in my personal experience I’ve seen companies headquartered in one country, with the vast majority of R&D and support in a second country, and manufacturing where you’d expect it in a third. And often the headquarters is basically on paper, and the company is mostly lead from a technical subdivision. Shane 23 hours ago Last I checked, they have opened 8 different locations here in my home state of Mississippi so I have no complaints about the company and I love the tools as well. They have made a large investment in a state that is in desperate need of it. Regardless of ownership, the locations are real, the jobs are real and the local economic impact is real. It’s time to put the COO purity test to rest and pay more attention to the investments that some of these manufacturers are making locally. It’s becoming nearly impossible to source everything that goes into a product from one country. Consider everything you own that contains any rare earths. Do you drive a car with a catalytic converter? Own any lithium ion batteries? Some part of these originated in China. The “good ole days” are gone. I own a couple of Veto tool bags. You can’t argue the quality or durability. Made in China. You have to judge things on their merits, not where it came from. Dave F 12 hours ago I live in Mississippi also and Im happy to see the amount of investment Milwaukee has done in Mississippi. SlowEng 18 hours ago Fact check. Milwaukee tool is a Subsidiary of Chinese Company. First being publicly traded has nothing to do with whether or not a company is Chinese or not. BYD, the Chinese car company, has Warren Buffett as an investor along with other major American financial institutions, is BYD therefore not a Chinese company? No it’s Chinese because it’s domiciled in China and has to follow Chinese law. Hong Kong is part of China not a independent nation. I use to work at Yokohama North America. An independent subsidiary of Yokohama Japan. Yokohama North America has headquarters in California and plants in the USA. They were stilled controlled by the parent company. What investments to make and what developments to pursue was all coordinated with the parent structure. Milwaukee is no different. Milwaukee did not setup its own plant in China to build just Milwaukee stuff separate from any other TTi product line. There will be a lot of design and resource sharing between all the TTI brands to coordinate costs and time. Milwaukee tools ultimately has to follow what TTI tells them because they are owned by the parent company. Independent subsidiary is legal term of art. It’s used to setup firewalls for litigation between various entities owned by the same parent entity. If Ryobi, as an example, has battery fires that cause damage to a home, then litigants may only be able to go after Ryobi, but not Milwaukee. Even though both companies are owned by TTI. This is not 100% but an important function of subsidiary companies. The Fact is Milwaukee Tool is subsidiary of Chinese Company. Stuart 16 hours ago But not “owned by China,” which is the common myth. I don’t know the full extent of production sharing. We’ve asked about this, and have been told that many tools from different brands come out of the same factories but from separate lines and with different parts, following independent development. There are times when like-themed products launch from different brands in a good, better, best tiering. Milwaukee operates independently from Ryobi, which is part of the same division as Ridgid. They’ve all said they don’t collaborate across (Milwaukee and TTI North America) brand lines, but it’d be foolish to ignore signs of common strategy at times. I’ve assumed that at higher levels there are “brand is working on a [tool], other brand should too,” directives, or it could come in the form of a customer (Home Depot) request. But how they operate is very different compared to say Craftsman and Dewalt, where teams might be shared between the brands. You don’t have Milwaukee designers working on Ryobi tools, or vise versa, even if you have shared factories. “Milwaukee tools have Ryobi parts” is another fallacy with no known signs or examples of proof. David 14 hours ago Any company that has presence in China controlled by Chinese communist party. China is like Soviet Union. None of them are independent. All their goals are subordinate to CCP. So TTI is owned by China. Hence Milwaukee is owned by China. Stuart 14 hours ago Sorry, but no; Milwaukee Tool is an American company and is not “owned by China.” Josh 13 hours ago Let me ask you this Stuart, since you are knowledgeable about this corporate structure: if TTI decided to close all American plants and relocate the entire structure of Milwaukee to China (I am not asking if this is likely or a good business decision), could they do so? Stuart 12 hours ago I don’t believe so. It’s my understanding that it would ultimately depend on the board of directors and even a shareholders vote. Let’s say that it comes to a vote, the relocation passes, and the US government doesn’t step in (I’m confident they would). In that case, I think that the most likely outcome is that Milwaukee Tool would be acquired or spun off into its own company. There’s no fathomable scenario where Milwaukee Tool could simply be uprooted and moved to China. I don’t see any way for TTI to have the kind of power to do what you’re asking. Chris D 9 hours ago This is where there is a gap in understanding. In the scenario, if “TTI decided it,” then it means it’s been decided by the executive board. The shareholders could disapprove and express it by voting the board members off, but the board would likely not take that decision if they couldn’t defend it (and their jobs) to the shareholders. That’s what is being missed here. TTI is the parent company, and they are in charge. Dave F 9 hours ago Horst Pudwill is the majority stakeholder of TTI. Not China. https://www.forbes.com/profile/horst-julius-pudwill/ Rick 5 hours ago “Any company that has presence in China controlled by Chinese communist party… So TTI is owned by China. Hence Milwaukee is owned by China.” This simply is not true, and claims like this demonstrate why this article is necessary. TTI certainly has to conform to the Hong Kong flavor of Chinese law, but there is no evidence that it is controlled by the Chinese government. TTI is a multinational company which is headquartered in Hong Kong (as opposed to mainland China) for significant tax and business reasons. That’s it. It’s worth spending a few seconds just looking at the directors of the company: https://www.ttigroup.com/company/our-board#executive_directors I expect that there are plenty of American companies with more Chinese faces on their board! And if the board of TTI found that government overreach was beoming a serious problem, I suspect that they could simply shutdown their operation in Hong Kong and move somewhere else. al 17 hours ago Cant say I care wither way, but its a bit disingenuous (if not outright false) to claim TTI is not a Chinese company simply because its shares are traded publicly. That would be like saying Yamaha is not a Japanese company because its stock is listed publicly. Just not true… Stuart 16 hours ago Publicly traded and based in HK/China. How one interprets that is open to opinion. “Milwaukee is owned by China” is often present as fact, and that’s completely inaccurate. What about Cleveland, which traded hands. Are they now “owned by Canada?” Or Stanley Black & Decker’s Facom, or USAG? Are those European brands or American? People seem to change their logic on a case by case basis because they prefer some brands and dislike others. al 16 hours ago Its not open to opinion though, the nation in which a company is incorporated/domiciled is a cut & dry fact. Milwaukee IS owned by a Chinese company. There’s no other interpretation or opinion that enters into the equation. Whether that matters is a matter of personal opinion Stuart 15 hours ago You’re talking about TTI. TTI is domiciled in HK, but Milwaukee Tool is domiciled in the USA. Cleveland Tool was recently owned by a company domiciled in China, and their current parent is domiciled in Canada. Cleveland never uprooted and to my knowledge remains domiciled in the USA. Martinez Tool is domiciled in the USA, but their parent company is domiciled in Sweden. Their parent, Hultafors, also owns Johnson Level, which is domiciled in the USA. If you were born and raised in California and then adopted by parents who live in Texas, but you still live in California, are you a Californian, or a Texan? You’d be a Californian, as a fact, and deviation from that becomes a matter of opinion. An extension of the myth that we see with TTI and Milwaukee would be “neither, you’re owned by Texas.” al 13 hours ago You state in the article that the following claim is inaccurate: “Milwaukee is owned by a Chinese company”. That is wrong. Milwaukee IS owned by a Chinese company (TTI). There’s no 2 ways about it Stuart 12 hours ago “Owned by a Chinese company” is still inaccurate. They are owned by a publicly-traded company based in Hong Kong. Maybe it wasn’t the best example, in which there are countless more that are even more inaccurate. In any case, Milwaukee Tool is an American company. Bonnie 11 hours ago TTI being publicly traded or domiciled in HK doesn’t mean they aren’t a Chinese company Stuart. I don’t understand why you keep repeating that. Hong Kong is part of China, regardless of the “one country two systems” concept (which has been wearing down as of late as the PRC exerts more active control). Would you claim that a Welsh tool company isn’t British? Stuart 11 hours ago @Bonnie, Wales is part of Great Britain but not part of England. Details are important. Bonnie 10 hours ago @Stuart Yes, and the detail here is that Hong Kong is part of China and answers to the PRC. Bonnie 11 hours ago There is an important difference between the statements “Milwaukee is owned by a Chinese company” and “Milwaukee is owned by China (PRC)”. The first is true, the latter is false. The article above is good and important, but I think you are also somewhat conflating these two separate statements. Dave F 9 hours ago Horst Pubwill is the majority stakeholder of TTI. Not China. https://www.forbes.com/profile/horst-julius-pudwill/ Bonnie 9 hours ago No, he is not the majority shareholder. He is the *largest* shareholder, as they state on their website. Majority shareholder means they control 50% or more of controlling shares (Google AI gets this wrong if that’s your source). Pudwill owns just under 20%, with his family holding an additional 1.8%. TTI has no majority stakeholder. Daniel L 16 hours ago Honestly… There’s a really, really salient critique to the kind of layers-upon-layers of obfuscation and ownership in these corporate structures. Alienation is a feature of these systems. Not a bug. Stuart 15 hours ago It’s not a feature and not a bug, just the muddy nature of how things are today with mergers and acquisitions and companies within companies. The same company owns GEICO, Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, Dairy Queen, and Jazwares (toys). How is the average person supposed to know this? Many people see “Milwaukee Tool is owned by China” on social media, take it as fact without checking, and the repeat it somewhere else. Collin 15 hours ago The rabidness in these comments is so strange. People seem to be nearly foaming at the mouth about the corporate structure of Milwaukee. To your point Stewart, the investment from TTI via Milwaukee into American manufacturing and engineering is outstanding. I’d say it’s better than most American-based companies. Just wait until people realize that their “American” Craftsman power tools were/are manufactured by TTI. sdsdv10 14 hours ago “Just wait until people realize that their “American” Craftsman power tools were/are manufactured by TTI.” I thought Craftsman was owned by Stanley Black & Decker, which I believe is a different company than TTI. Stuart 14 hours ago TTI made some Craftsman cordless power tools for Sears. To my knowledge that ended when SBD – Dewalt’s parent company – acquired the Craftsman brand. Regarding the nature of comments, the frequency of off-topic rantings and ramblings has greatly increased over the years, as if people feel personal politics need to be injected into every single conversation. As long as arguments are well and politely articulated, civil discussion is welcome. Bill 13 hours ago TTI owns Milwaukee. Therefore, it would have the final say. It would be pointless to own a company and then not care about any decisions dealing with product development. Therefore, IMO, it is a Chinese run company. And, I don’t care. I love my Milwaukee stuff. I just wish that it was easier on the wallet. I have seriously considered going with Craftsman because I am more of a DIY person, but I love good tools. What am I supposed to do. 🙂 TomD 2 hours ago I mean if we go to “not going to happen final say” then if China orders TTI to do whatever, the US could nationalize Milwaukee. It doesn’t really matter in the actuality of day to day life. Robert 13 hours ago not “owned by China,” Actually, if they are operating out of Hong Kong they are to some degree. Any Chinese nationals there are subject to government dictates. So the Chinese government regardless of the percentage of ownership has influence on TTI to at least that degree. Stuart 13 hours ago John lives in Texas and is subject to local laws. John Jr. lives in Alaska. By your logic, the Texas government would have influence over John Jr’s activities. You fell into a common logic trap. scott 13 hours ago You did too. China dont play fair. If Texas says they will jail ole dad, until John Jr. send them some info, wonder if John Jr sends it. Stuart 12 hours ago John Jr was raised to deny control to blackmailers, so no. “I wonder if” and other conditional hypotheticals are not a basis for determining factual truths. Ed 12 hours ago Except you are affording the same “rights” for lack of a better term to corporations (a legal entity) as you are a person. It does not work that way. Multi-national corporations have defined structures. Ultimately, the proverbial buck stops with TTI in HK. The same applies to Motorola Mobility in HK, Firestone in Japan, or Budweiser in Belgium. All of these are American brands which operate as a subsidiary of a foreign-controlled parent company. Stuart 12 hours ago If we were talking about “TTI Wisconsin,” I might agree with you, but we’re not. The nuances of an American company owned by a publicly-traded company based in HK gets messy, but it remains completely untrue to argue “Milwaukee Tool is owned by China” or “Milwaukee is headquartered in China.” Those are among the most commonly parroted myths about the subject. Ed 11 hours ago The same could be said for the other examples I provided. Spin it any way you’d like, but that’s the case. How much experience do you have working for an “American” company with foreign ownership? I’m not here to question your competence, but I’ve spent much of my career at companies with similar arrangements to Milwaukee. Understanding how these organizations function isn’t something typically understood by someone who hasn’t worked under such an arrangement. Chris D 9 hours ago This is exactly where I’m coming from. I work for a company in the US that, if I told you the name, you would google them and conclude they are a western-European company because that’s where the headquarters is. It’s even publicly traded on a European exchange. I could give you a tour of our US plants, US test labs, and you might think we are a US company. But: we are a subsidiary of the European company, which is a subsidiary of…a Chinese company. And the Chinese company absolutely has a say in how we operate and what we do. We’re a Chinese company. And the profits make their way back there. Again, no value judgement, it’s just the way it is. That’s the perspective I’m trying to add here, as someone who lives in this kind of business each day. scott 13 hours ago As far a owned by China, Jack Ma, would disagree. As he found out, the Party is will to do things to help folks understand, certain things are not tolerated. China does not own TTI, but they can control lots of things if they want to, just as Jack Ma found out. If TTI was doing advanced microchip research you can bet that it was getting shared, power tool research not so much. Anyone doing manufacturing in china has to understand this. Only company that stayed away that I know of was Stihl, and dang do they make some good tools. Most of there US manufacturing is done in Va Beach, and has been for many many years. Dave F 12 hours ago Publicly traded corporations are owned by their shareholders. According to public information, Horst Pubwill is the largest shareholder of TTI. That doesnt seem too Chinese to me. Of course TTI has to abide by Hong Kong law because they are domiciled there. But owned by China, not really. https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TECHTRONIC-INDUSTRIES-CO–134983/company-shareholders/ Scott K 12 hours ago You’ve addressed this and other misconceptions several times – while I feel as though it’s important to set the record straight and educate people, some aren’t open to hearing different than what they believe. Some people immediately shut down when they hear “China.” Buying Milwaukee tools made in China still benefits Americans because those purchases support the many sales, engineering, and other positions held by Americans in America. This isn’t really a difficult concept to grasp if you’re open to it. Stuart 11 hours ago As you say, some people will ignore facts to believe what they want to believe. With this, “Milwaukee is owned by China” and “Milwaukee is HQed in China” have become sensational myths that some people believe or perpetuate without fact-checking. Generally speaking, Harbor Freight’s Chicago Electric and Pittsburgh brands are just labels attached to imported tools. Many people realize this at different times – or not – and so it doesn’t take much for people to be erroneously convinced that similar might be true for other brands or companies. “Milwaukee is owned by/HQed in China” is inaccurate, but believable if you don’t check the facts. Some people will repeat misinformation as part of some agenda, but there are enough that simply haven’t fact-checked the claims. Norm 11 hours ago Does this mean SK Tools is technically an American company? Stuart 11 hours ago Not much is left of SK, and so I’d say no. As I understand it, SK is now an American brand. Jack 11 hours ago As SlowEng said it rather eloquently below, the term “Independent Subsidiary”, which you are in part hanging your hat on, does not really exist in terms of sensitive or major decisions. Would we be having this same discussion if Milwaukee made defense equipment instead of drills? If you think that the parent company couldn’t access any technology it wanted from the “Independent Subsidiary” whenever it wanted to, you’re being naive. And if it wanted to use a Milwaukee technology in a Ryobi product I think its additionally naive to think there is some sort of “wall” between the brands that would prevent that. I’m not sure why you are speculating that that couldn’t happen. It’s wonderful that Milwaukee has greatly helped the economy in Mississippi and has created jobs. And its kept a great American brand alive and made it a major player in the tool segment. Foreign investment here is not automatically a bad thing. If it makes you feel better to say that “Milwaukee isn’t owned by the Chinese” then fine, I would concede that point. But I’m not sure that’s the right question to begin with. If the parent company is domiciled in China, then various actors in China have ultimate influence and access to the “Independent Subsidiary”, plain and simple, including moving the company out of the US if they see fit, so I disagree with you on that as well. But if its in the best interests of the parent company to keep the mfg. here, then they will continue to do so, but not because Milwaukee is independent. Because of the way in which China competes, and additionally how the Honk Kong stock exchange and its rules differ from ours, your example of Texas / California is not a good one, in my opinion, to the subject here. I love your site and the work you do here, and I’m not meaning to throw shade your way, but I don’t think many folks here are buying your argument. Stuart 10 hours ago then various actors in China have ultimate influence and access to the “Independent Subsidiary”, plain and simple, including moving the company out of the US if they see fit Are there any historical examples where what you propose could happen has happened? KokoTheTalkingApe 11 hours ago Another myth I’ve heard a few times: “Milwaukee is made in the same factory as X so they’re really the same tools and Milwaukee’s high prices are bullshit.” Not true, and even if they were made in the same factory (as happens with some heavy woodworking tools like lathes), that doesn’t mean they are the same tools. They have different parts going into them, they have different quality standards, and they have VERY different after-sale support, return policies, etc. I don’t care if Rikon is made in the same factory as a Harbor Freight. I can call Rikon and immediately talk to an engineer who actually knows the tools, even the discontinued ones. That’s worth money to me. Stuart 11 hours ago Yes – that’s another big misconception, but also one that’s much more difficult to debunk. It’s false, but credible. TonyT 10 hours ago One question for everyone who disagrees with Stuart: Was Milwaukee an American company before TTI bought it? Note that Milwaukee’s previous owner was Atlas-Copco of Sweden: https://www.contractormag.com/tools/article/20875773/milwaukee-electric-aeg-bought and I’ll say that, without doubt, TTI’s ownership has been better for Milwaukee (and American jobs) than Atlas-Copco’s. Stuart 9 hours ago Can we credit TTI for Milwaukee’s success, or Milwaukee Tool’s leaders and decision-makers, with Steven Richman now at the helm of all of TTI as CEO? Luke 9 hours ago Stuart, thanks for helping clear this up for everyone. It’s wild to see people so furiously argue with straight facts. I didn’t realize your average reader was so damn terrified of China. Andy 3 hours ago Right? I’m not sure if it’s scary or entertaining how scared done people are Jason 9 hours ago I’ve often wondered why they don’t just dual list. Plenty of companies do, IIRC Alibaba was trying to get listed on NYSE as a secondary. Andy 3 hours ago I’m going to go ahead and call this the most entertaining post of the year. At least so far. Chris 2 hours ago Milwaukee Tool is American based in terms of its operational footprint, history, and brand identity, but it is not American owned. It is a foreign owned subsidiary. It might have US based leadership, R&D, marketing, and manufacturing facilities in several states including Mississippi, Wisconsin, and South Carolina. Be ownership is by Techtronic Industries (TTI), a Hong Kong-based parent company. ChipBoundary 12 minutes ago No, it is owned by China, because all companies in China are owned and controlled by the government. If a government official comes into a Chinese company, even a publicly traded one, and tells them to do or change something then that is exactly what they do. No questions, no appeals, no hesitations. That’s how China works. All companies are the government, pure and simple. That is the facts. Now, my problem with Chinese products begins and ends with Internet connected products. Outside of that, I do not care. I’m a disabled veteran, as patriotic as they come, and I’m even born and raised in Wisconsin. Milwaukee are the best power tools, period. Anybody that argues otherwise is delusional. I use other brands as they are what I can afford at various times, but the few Milwaukees I have and have used, are second to none. Every union millwright I’ve ever known is exclusively Milwaukee. Are other tools good? Absolutely. Are they better? No. Your email address will not be published.

(Bloomberg) -- George Hongchoy plans to retire as head of Link Asset Management Ltd., the manager of Asia’s largest real estate investment trust. Hongchoy, 63, will remain with the property firm as it searches for a successor, Hong Kong-based Link said in a statement Tuesday. A former investment banker, Hongchoy joined Link in 2009 as chief financial officer before moving to the top job the following year. Link manages the Link REIT, which runs HK$226 billion ($29 billion) in assets across retail, office and logistics, according to its website. Under Hongchoy’s tenure, the LINK REIT has more than doubled the Hang Seng Index, returning 10.2% a year including dividends, compared with a 5% annual gain for Hong Kong’s main equity gauge. Over that time, Link has diversified its portfolio, which initially comprised low-end neighborhood malls in Hong Kong. It now also holds office buildings and shopping malls in mainland China, Australia, Singapore and the UK. Hongchoy has been one of the highest paid executives in Hong Kong, awarded annual pay of HK$70 million. Link has also expanded into fund management. It hired John Saunders, former head of Asia-Pacific real estate at BlackRock Inc., last year to lead the operation known as Link Real Estate Partners. “In a challenging market, Link’s continued resilience shows the underlying strength of the business,” Duncan Owen, chair of Link said in the statement. “We have good momentum in our efforts to grow and diversify our investment platform with the recent launch of Link Real Estate Partners.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end. And it is this factor that will, in the end, cause the Fed to embark upon a rate lowering cycle. Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end.

The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Institutional Demand Surges As Ethereum Sets New Inflow Records

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as institutional capital continues to flood into the market at an unprecedented pace. This surge in demand reflects institutional investors who are increasingly viewing ETH as a valuable asset. According to Axel Gaubert’s post on X, ETH is pumping hard after $2.77 billion was added to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA). This signals immense institutional appetite for the asset and underscores growing confidence in Ethereum’s role as both a financial instrument and a foundational layer for decentralized applications. Gaubert notes that the inflows reflect mainstream validation, but create questions around Satoshi’s philosophy. The core ideals of decentralization and independence from traditional finance are being tested as legacy institutions like BlackRock move in, and Ethereum is a very opinionated blockchain. The fact that BlackRock can now build on Ethereum and accumulate ETH at scale reflects Ethereum’s core philosophy, open access, programmable money, and institutional-grade architecture. Ethereum continues to make history as institutional interest surges to unprecedented levels. In the past week, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $2.18 billion in net inflows last week, which is the highest weekly inflow the products have ever recorded. This surge underscores the growing confidence institutional investors have in Ethereum’s long-term value, particularly as regulatory clarity improves and ETH cements its place as a core layer of infrastructure. As mentioned by Vincent on X, Ethereum has gained momentum, and trading between $3,100 and $3,600 at the time of the post, reflecting a 20% rally within a week. This surge is fueled by strong inflows into spot ETH ETFs and rising institutional demand, both of which are acting as major tailwinds for the asset. The ETF data has confirmed rising interest, and shows over $2.1 billion flowed into spot ETFs last week. This surge marks one of the largest weekly inflows for ETH ETFs, reflecting a broader trend of capital rotation toward crypto contract platforms. BlackRock Ethereum Trust (ETHA) now holds an impressive $9.17 billion in assets, which is nearly half of all capital invested across Ethereum ETFs. Furthermore, the Regulatory developments are supportive. The recent GENIUS Act tightens Stablecoin oversight while reinforcing trust in ETH settlement infrastructure. This dual effect positions ETH as a more credible and robust network for institutional activity. ETH currently secures $76 billion in DeFi TVL and $128 billion in Stablecoin supply. On-chain signals show strength as Staking participation continues to rise, a sign of long-term confidence among holders. The futures open interest has reached a record of $51 billion. This reflects deep institutional engagement. Meanwhile, ETH supply is deflationary due to burns and staking. Finally, Vincent sees $4,000 ETH as the next resistance level and stated that May’s Pectra upgrade will improve smart accounts, staking UX, and L2 integration, which are bullish for utility and scalability.

Title: Microsoft abruptly stops selling and renting movies and TV shows on Xbox and Windows devices

But existing customers will still be able to access their purchased content As of July 18, Microsoft has stopped selling and renting TV shows and movies on both Xbox and Windows devices. An update to both the Xbox and Windows websites confirms "Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content." Microsoft did not provide a reason for the withdrawal of service, but did assure customers that existing paid content will remain available for the foreseeable future. "Existing customers can continue to access their previously purchased content on Windows and Xbox devices," the FAQ added, "[and] players can continue to play personal videos on Xbox devices. Windows customers can continue to have access to playback and the download functionality." In a FAQ that asks what other options players may have going forward, Microsoft suggests they make use of third-party entertainment apps like Amazon Prime and Apple TV. Xbox commenced its entertainment offerings in 2006, offering an initial lineup of TV shows and movies to gamers in the U.S. via Xbox Live on the one-year anniversary of its Xbox 360 console. It was the first gaming console to offer standard and high-definition TV shows and movies via digital distribution and formed part of Xbox's then lofty aspiration to be a comprehensive unified online entertainment network on its systems. Microsoft began making layoffs across its gaming division earlier this month, just days after multiple rumors and reports started to swirl. Over 9,000 employees are thought to have been affected.

Title: Economist Warns the AI Bubble Is Worse Than Immediately Before the Dot-Com Implosion
URL: https://futurism.com/economist-ai-bubble-worse-dot-com-implosion
Time Published: 2025-07-21T21:03:15Z
Full Content:
For years now, certain experts have warned that the AI industry is a massive bubble waiting to burst. The enormous hype driving a market frenzy, they say, could lead to a collapse if it's exposed to be built on widespread overpromising. Most recently, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok warned that the current AI bubble is starting to look even worse than the market conditions leading up to the dot-com implosion of the late 1990s. "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s," Slok wrote in a note that was widely circulated online. A chart shows the price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten performing companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. A high P/E ratio, generally speaking, indicates that a stock's price is extremely high relative to its earnings. The chart shows that the P/E ratio continues to creep higher and higher over the last five years, well above the rates we saw throughout the 1990s. In other words, the top ten companies in the S&P 500 are far more overvalued than they were in the years leading up to the dot-com crisis. Slok is ringing the alarm bells over the apparent market frenzy, driven by tech titans that are heavily invested in the AI industry. By index weighting, AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the pack in the S&P 500, followed by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet, all of which have made multibillion-dollar investments in AI. Yet earnings are still lagging far behind the astronomical spending on building out infrastructure, with some tech leaders already showing early signs of hesitancy, given the massive P/E discrepancy. Slok is far from the first to compare the current hype surrounding AI to the dot-com bubble. Even in 2023, when OpenAI's ChatGPT was only a few months old, analysts warned investors were overinvesting in unproven tech. AI critic Ed Zitron has also compared the situation to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007, which led to the collapse of the US housing market. Silicon Valley's endless appetite for AI was seriously tested earlier this year when a Chinese AI company called DeepSeek demonstrated that its AI chatbot, which cost a fraction of the computing power to train as conventional models, could trade blows with the latest large language models from the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Google, triggering a more than $1 trillion selloff at the time. How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key players in the AI race remains to be seen. Despite an explosion in popularity for tools like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, revenue still pales in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars being spent on data center expansions. According to an S&P Global research note published in June, the generative AI market is projected to grow at a breakneck pace, reaching an aggregate revenue of $85 billion by 2029. However, when you consider that's only a little more than the over $60 billion Meta will spend on capital expenditures this year alone, tech companies still have a lot of reassuring to do that their massive bet on AI will eventually pay off — and not lead to the sequel of one of the biggest stock market crashes in history.

Arm (ARM) shares climbed Monday as analysts at Wells Fargo raised their price target for the chip designer’s stock ahead of quarterly earnings due next week. The analysts raised their target to $175 from $145, well above the mean of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, which sits at about $143. Shares of Arm rose over 3% to close near $162 Monday, and have added roughly a third of their value in 2025. Arm, which develops CPU designs used in chips from companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, could be well-positioned to benefit from “expanding AI opportunities,” including growing data center demand, Wells Fargo told clients in a note Sunday. "We continue to estimate strong growth for Arm's royalties business despite tariff-related uncertainty," Wells Fargo said, adding that Arm’s ramp of AI and custom silicon designs could "drive meaningful royalty revenue growth” this fiscal year. Arm is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings after the market closes on July 30.

Title: Right-Wing Leader Says Conservatives Need ‘Scalps’ of Woke Wall Street CEOs

Time Published: 2025-07-21T18:10:05Z
Full Content:
By Lauren Windsor In late January, the CEO of the pro-business American Legislative Exchange Council told right-wing operatives and officials that they need a “scalp” from one of two supposedly woke CEOs of major Wall Street firms. Lisa Nelson, who leads ALEC, was discussing Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, the second largest bank in the country. She appeared to be speaking metaphorically, as she struggled to refer to an unknown movie. Nelson made the comments at the Consumers’ Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has obtained exclusive audio and documents from the event. Nelson noted she had spoken about this at breakfast. “Whether it’s Larry Fink or Brian Moynihan, we have got to take one of these guys out,” she said, presumably another metaphor. She added, “Brian Moynihan is the guy, or Larry Fink is the guy that we should have their scalp.” ALEC is a powerful “bill mill” that brings corporations, conservative advocates, and state legislators together to hash out right-wing, pro-business legislation that is then introduced nationwide, with a focus on red states. A spokesperson for ALEC declined to comment for this story. “Over the past three years, the assets BlackRock manages on behalf of our clients have grown by $4 trillion to $12.5 trillion,” says a BlackRock spokesperson. “We are focused on delivering for each and every client in every market we operate in around the world, including helping millions of Americans in states across the country retire with dignity.” Bank of America declined to comment, though a person familiar with the matter says that the bank’s representatives attended ALEC’s annual meeting last week. Fink and his firm BlackRock have become primary targets in conservatives’ crusade against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The firm has trillions in assets under management, and manages billions of dollars for public pension funds. Because of its extensive holdings, BlackRock exerts enormous influence across the stock market through shareholder votes. In his widely-read annual letters to CEOs, Fink has written that “climate risk is investment risk.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Moynihan, for his part, has defended the idea of inclusion in the workplace, characterizing it as a positive business opportunity. Consumers’ Research targeted Bank of America in 2023 for engaging in “anti-consumer” behaviors: namely, having internal DEI training and offering tips for how clients can calculate their greenhouse gas emissions. Amid Republican attacks on ESG and DEI, including from President Donald Trump, BlackRock and Bank of America both dropped out of Net Zero alliances, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Additionally, both companies have eliminated their DEI goals, while maintaining a general commitment to inclusion. Consumers’ Research, which hosted the event, is at the center of a network of nonprofits tied to the right-wing power broker Leonard Leo that is waging a “War on Woke” against corporations and financiers who embrace ESG investment criteria — or the idea that asset managers should consider the threat of planetary devastation when deploying money. Leo’s network helps fund ALEC, which has pushed model legislation in the states to ban asset managers for state retirement funds from promoting ESG. The anti-ESG coalition has notched some wins in terms of BlackRock and Bank of America’s public posturing, but these conservatives argue the fight is far from over. “We have our good examples. We’re sharing them every day when they get out of something,” Nelson noted, but “it’s words right now.” Related Content Jimmy Fallon Responds to Colbert Cancellation: ‘I Don’t Like What’s Going On’ Stephen Colbert Addresses Cancellation by Telling Trump to ‘Go F-ck Yourself’ Jon Stewart to CBS After Colbert's 'Late Show' Cancellation: 'Go F-ck Yourself' Trump's Wildly Fascistic Posting Spree Isn't Just a Distraction From Epstein That’s why conservatives need their scalps, Nelson explained. “And, you know, and that’s — it’s like the scalps. I don’t know what the movie is,” she said, adding it was about “taking the scalps.” “Brian Moynihan would be the perfect person,” Nelson continued. “We were talking about it at lunch, or breakfast. I think he is ideologically all-in on everything he’s doing.” Comparing him to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, the ALEC chief said she doesn’t believe that Dimon is “all-in” ideologically. “I think he is just seeing where the winds are blowing and trying to have his cake and eat it, too — and ‘I’m gonna play footsie with everybody,’ and all is going to be OK for JPMorgan in his mind,” Nelson asserted. Nelson spoke with a JPMorgan executive on a panel at ALEC’s annual meeting last week. A JPMorgan representative declined to comment but confirmed the firm is an ALEC member. ALEC does not disclose its donors or a full list of its members. The organization receives some corporate funding, including from Chevron, and donations from lobbying groups for Big Pharma, fossil fuel interests, the telecom industry, and electric utilities. ALEC’s Private Enterprise Advisory Council includes Mike Thompson, a top lieutenant at Leo’s consulting firm CRC Advisors, which helped manage the summit; as well as execs at Consumers’ Research; the American Bankers Association (ABA); oil billionaire Charles Koch’s business empire; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington’s top business lobby. Bank of America previously cut ties with ALEC in 2012. Nelson, who previously ran global government relations at credit card giant Visa, made her comments about the CEOs during a larger conversation about the necessity of political neutrality in public investments. Fiduciaries, like BlackRock, are legally bound to act in the best financial interests of their clients. Conservative politicians and groups, ALEC included, have demanded that companies eschew ESG and DEI as part of their investment criteria, arguing the only thing that should matter is maximizing shareholder profit. During Nelson’s panel, an operative asked the panelists if they had any examples where Republican-led states had “in their efforts to kind of correct, [and] go from liberal ESG investing, instead of going back to neutral, they over-corrected,” to a place where they’re putting public money into conservative investments. “If we want neutral, we should want neutral,” the operative said. Debate ensued, with most participants concluding that long-suffering conservatives needed to beat back Big Banks, who are in cahoots with the Left — neutrality be damned. “That’s a very good kind of point to bring up,” Nelson said. “But I think you know, we should plant our flag as far as we possibly can.” Thompson, the CRC exec who moderated the panel, agreed, but was more explicit, comparing the Left and Big Banks to Hitler: “If the Allies said, ‘Hey, Hitler, will you go neutral? You’ve taken over France. You’ve got Northern Africa. You’ve got all this stuff. We’ll stop if you stop.’ OK, he’ll stop for a little while and then he’ll keep coming.” He complained about an initiative attempting to get companies to reduce their climate impact, because it was rating corporations and docking them for giving money to nonprofits that do not align with their climate goals. “Which means ALEC,” Thompson said, adding it “means Consumers’ Research should get no money from the other side.” “We need to stop their momentum and then push back,” Thompson continued. “We don’t need them to go, ‘Oh, we’re neutral now. We’ve run over 90 percent of your world. We’ve burned down 90 percent of your house, and now we’ll stop’ … Sometimes that means not neutral. It means get us back to where we can be neutral. It’s not enough to say, ‘We’re no longer gonna push the DEI agenda, but we’re still going to have trans bathrooms, you can go to any bathroom you want, do whatever you want. No, no, no. You have to rip out all those policies.’” Tom Jones — the right-wing opposition researcher notorious for publishing a DEI Watch List of mostly Black federal officials he decided should be fired by Trump — argued that conservatives should not “get wedded” to neutrality. “Publicly held funds should reflect the values of Americans, and if that means we’re not going to invest in companies that support boycott, divestment, and sanctions, [against Israel] or we’re not going to invest in companies that use slave labor in China, or we’re not going to invest in companies that invest in Iran because it’s a threat to American national security, we should 100 percent have those policies,” said Jones. “I don’t know what neutral means — but legal and principled,” said perennial anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who seemed irritated with his compatriots’ hypocrisy. “I think you can’t go to a court and say, ‘We want to make decisions that aren’t fiduciary, but we shouldn’t be ruled to be stealing people’s money, but they do.’ I have no idea how you don’t get laughed out of court with any argument…. This is a real slippery slope, and I don’t know how you make that argument without laughing at yourself.” Described by NPR in 2001 as a “conservative revolutionary,” Norquist famously told the outlet: “I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.” A spokesperson for Consumers’ Research tells Rolling Stone, ​“For years, megalomaniacs at the helm of powerful corporations like BlackRock and Bank of America exploited their positions to impose a political agenda and bully others into compliance. The American people have had enough and they are demanding a return to business, not activism. Neutrality means moving away from the far left and back to focusing on consumers. There is still a long way to go and damage to make amends for before these companies and others like them can earn the public’s trust again.” GOP attorneys general — long financed by Leo through their Republican Attorneys General Association — are currently suing BlackRock on alleged antitrust violations regarding its coal investments. The effort is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose top deputy bragged during a different panel that he threatened another big bank, Wells Fargo, into leaving the Net Zero Banking Alliance. (Texas had similarly threatened Bank of America’s bond business, until it dropped out of the climate coalition.) Even former Congressman Ken Buck, who was the ranking Republican on the Antitrust Subcommittee, thinks Paxton’s case against BlackRock is politically motivated “lawfare.”In May, Democrats in the Senate and House announced probes into the exodus of banks from major climate change initiatives. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, tells Rolling Stone: “We have apparent open admissions — straight from the mouths of fossil-fuel-funded Republican operatives and lawmakers — of their phony anti-ESG scheme and their calls for the ‘scalps’ of the banking executives who’ve warned about the systemic risks from climate change.”Facing increasingly costly legal backlash from Republican state officials in the Leo network, BlackRock has tried to mend fences with conservatives. In January 2024, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick detailed Fink’s moves to get back into his good graces, by lining up investors for new natural gas plants in the state’s power grid. That didn’t dissuade Paxton from launching the antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock last November.

They’ve continued even after the financier made a huge overture to Trump, in helping to achieve one of his key priorities: wresting control of the Panama Canal from China.

Title: The risks and rewards of tokenization as crypto heavyweights push for it

By ALAN SUDERMAN, Associated Press As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. “Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France. Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors. But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century’s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood’s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world’s most popular startups. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television. “You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don’t get to choose your program, you couldn’t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.” Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that’s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what’s been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. “Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country’s securities law. Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump’s victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren’t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private. That’s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.” But Robinhood’s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood’s plan and did not endorse it. “Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.” Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don’t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago. “Where we’re headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn’t understand.”

Title: Unilever’s Growth Comes From Finding Opportunity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/07/21/unilevers-growth-comes-from-finding-opportunity/

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. The biggest business story of the last week has had nothing to do with tariffs, M&A, finance or earnings. It’s a relatively minor scandal. And since we’re all online, we’ve all seen it more times than we care to count: Former Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon was caught on camera at a Coldplay concert canoodling with the company’s Chief People Officer Kristen Cabot. On Friday, both Bryon and Cabot were placed on leave pending an investigation from the company’s board. On Saturday, Bryon resigned. “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said on X. Chief Product Officer and cofounder Pete DeJoy is taking over as interim CEO while Bryon’s replacement is sought. Astronomer’s company name has been dragged through the mud, though the vast majority of people sharing the image of Bryon and Cabot probably could not even describe what the company does. Astronomer is a company that uses Apache Airflow to manage data operations, helping companies leverage data for AI integration, application development and unlock deeper insights. The company closed a $93 million Series D round in May, led by Bain Capital Ventures and Salesforce Ventures. The press release detailing the funding round highlights several key accomplishments over the past 12 months: 150% year-over-year recurring revenue growth, 130% net revenue retention, and a two-year path to profitability. The company was valued at more than $1 billion at the time of the funding round. Will the new exposure and speedy investigation ultimately bring Astronomer more business? Or will Bryon and Cabot’s viral moment cost the company customers? It’s doubtful on both counts. As a B2B tech company, Astronomer’s external reputation probably won’t come into play. And in a few months the general public may still be talking about the Coldplay kiss cam moment, but they most likely won’t be talking about Astronomer as a company. Will the viral moment make fundraising more difficult? Potentially, since company leaders are the ones who need to steward new money, and poor personal choices of former executives may reflect badly on the board members and leaders who hired them in the first place. This serves as a reminder that executives always represent their companies–even during off-hours. This viral moment might have been forgotten by now if it didn’t involve two leaders of a company. Byron and Cabot’s positions add a layer of gawking and gossip, bringing a tech company into many conversations where it never would have found itself otherwise. Even as the global economy has grown more cautious and uncertain, Unilever has been on a steady path. I spoke with Herrish Patel, president of Unilever USA and CEO of its Personal Care division, about the company’s growth and plans for the future. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. What cautious economy? Looking at the top-line financial numbers from last week, stocks surged as many companies reported better-than-expected profits. The S&P 500 set a new record high on Thursday, as 88% of companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to blunt the majority of the impact when they come, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that there is a distressing sign coming from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards.

In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, food and drinks in the office will cost companies more starting on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but it expires at the end of this year. The perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work makes them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it could be difficult for companies to choose a non-deductible employee perk. OpenAI logo at the World News Media Congress in Poland. There are many challenges to enterprise AI deployment, including how to best use it. OpenAI is reportedly getting into this space. The Information recently reported that the provider is offering enterprise-grade GPT-4o deployments staffed with its engineers at a starting price of $10 million, writes Forbes contributor Sol Rashidi. Consulting can yield higher margins of 40% to 60%, Rashidi writes. OpenAI isn’t the only AI provider rushing into consulting. Google, Meta and Anthropic are all trying to augment their tools with deployment assistance. And while it is pricey to add deployment services on top of the platform agreement and software access, some companies may find it worthwhile to guarantee a smooth integration with AI systems. OpenAI is adding more to its offerings, launching its ChatGPT Agent last week. The agent is a virtual assistant that can complete work and various simple tasks, such as creating slide decks from notes, purchasing ingredients from a recipe or submitting expense reports. It will be available on enterprise plans in coming weeks, the company said. Unilever USA President and CEO of Personal Care Herrish Patel. Herrish Patel has worked for Unilever, one of the world’s largest CPG companies, for 24 years. In nearly a quarter century, the global company specializing in beauty, personal care, home care, food products and ice cream has taken Patel and his family around the globe, giving him a multifaceted perspective on how to innovate and grow already-strong brands. He became the president of Unilever USA and the CEO of its Personal Care division in 2024. I spoke with him about how he’s growing brands that are already in 98% of American homes, plus how he strengthens his team at a company that is an international behemoth. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is your strategy to build the U.S. market and getting to growth? Patel: It starts with the trends that are going to shape the U.S. I’m a big believer that the role of leadership teams in your categories is to predict where a category is going to be in three years from now. I call it getting to the future faster, or take the organization to the future and then bring them back. If I look at personal care and where it will be in three to five years, there’s certain segments, like whole body deodorants. The reality is, over the last couple of years, some insurgent brands brought to life the idea that we sweat beyond the armpit, and it’s built a whole new leg to the category, to a segment that could be $500 million going forward. The second piece is serum technology. We invented bar [soap] in a way. We then went into liquids. The next frontier will be serum technology, which is starting to converge the next generation of moisturization and body wash. Again, technology led. Lastly, you see it on TikTok and social media, people are looking for mood transportation through showers through neural signaling. We’re making an adjacency move on a brand called Olly, a vitamin supplement brand full of scientific claims and a sense that is good for karma, it’s good for mood. We are obsessed about having the science and technology, the right packaging, the right communication platform. That’s the first thing that is at the heartbeat of the business, and we’re obsessed about being market makers, category builders. The second piece is you work with the biggest retailers in the U.S. to be a category leader. You act like a category leader, you show up like a category leader and you start to share how you’re going to build the category over multiple years through your marketing and science investments. We’ve shared this U.S.-for-U.S. [A recent quote said] it’s like a new Unilever that’s agile, it’s fast and it’s moving with consumer trends which move fast in the U.S. You mentioned team building. How do you do that with a company that is as large as Unilever? In Personal Care, we call it ‘Making it personal.’ Once you have your strategy and your big bets, you build a structure to be in service to the strategy. Then strategy, structure and sourcing. Sourcing is the talent. There’s also a strategic position. You’ve built a team first that is designed to deliver the strategic position of Unilever. We serve 98% of American households, so we are going to move categories forward. The second piece that I’m a big fan of, is what I call wasting time together. It means that you invest and spend time getting to know the team. Trust and unity comes when you know beyond the face: what’s important in their lives, family, friends, how they grew up. That shapes some of the behaviors you see. Thirdly, once you’ve got a structure, you waste time, you build trust. We call it objectives, key results, OKRs. I call them mountains we’re trying to climb. Behind that strategy’s three or four mountains, we constantly sit and review where we are on that mountain, what have we learned, what we want to adjust. Then we work as a team to say the next stage of that mountain looks X or Y. Yesterday, we sat for a whole day as a leadership team and did exactly that. What are we celebrating? What is the strategic progress we’re making? Is the organization running to its potential? What are some of the leadership learnings, and where do we need to inspire and move the organization forward? I call it hardware and software. 50% is hardware, is strategy. 50% is software, and making sure the team is united in that journey. Right now we are in a period of economic uncertainty, and it’s hard to forecast anything. How does that impact Unilever? We see the recession as an opportunity, [rather] than more of a threat. What we will see is a polarization where people will seek value, while some consumers will still seek premiumization. From a U.S. perspective, we’ve got a portfolio that serves brilliant value, but we’ve also got a premium portfolio. As it continues to polarize, we’ve got a portfolio—I call it how you win the recession. We consciously talk about it. How do you come out stronger from the recession? That takes leadership, it takes a point of view. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong, but it’s important to have a strong point of view. That you take the moment where there might be some economic uncertainty for maybe two or three quarters, but we come out stronger as a consequence. What advice would you give to other business executives? This is a really important time of leadership. I think it is the time to reflect on who we are, what we stand for, and make sure that we continue to serve the U.S. with the latest innovations and grow our businesses. Personally, I think this is a moment of your own values, your own leadership style, and how you continue to adjust to lead the organization through it. I think the future is really bright in the U.S., so I think the economic outlook long-term, mid-term, will be very strong. What I’m inspired by is the thousands that work for Unilever U.S. still wake up wanting to make an impact at 98% of US households. That’s my job. How do I create an environment where everyone can flourish and maximize their potential? And that's what I do every day. My reflective moment is how can I lead to create that environment, to serve all of America, and my people are inspired to do it; they believe they have an impact.

The rush to attract the global investor at all hours of the day is on. Charles Schwab (SCHW) said Monday it is adding more securities, primarily ETFs, for 24-hour trading, bringing the total to 1,100 stocks and funds that retail investors can access outside normal U.S. business hours. The online broker extended trading access to its clients for stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, as well as a range of exchange-traded funds, in February. Its rivals Robinhood (HOOD) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), have extended trading hours that go beyond both the regular session, during which volumes are highest, and the traditional premarket and after-hours sessions. “As the pace of interconnected global markets activity increases and market-moving news and events happen outside of regular U.S. market hours, 24-hour trading gives investors flexibility and access that can be critical to take advantage of potential opportunities – as well as helping to manage risk," Charles Schwab Managing Director James Kostulias said. The most-traded stocks that Charles Schwab said it has seen since launching 24-hour trading earlier this year are shares of Tesla (TSLA), AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), and Chinese EV maker NIO (NIO), the company said.

A new CoinShares report says "Ethereum stole the show," with institutional demand for the world's second cryptocurrency rising after solid price gains. Total inflows into ETH products stood at about $2.12 billion in the week to July 19, a huge influx considering the year-to-date total stands at about $6.2 billion. It's also close to double the previous record of $1.2 billion. The global figures also show that Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows were practically neck and neck as investors chase healthier returns. Bitcoin flows for the week hit nearly $2.2 billion. While BTC did hit a fresh all-time high of $123,000 last Monday, it's been relatively flat as altcoins enjoy a resurgence. ETH's price has jumped by 25% over the past week, and remains about $1,000 away from a record of $4,891 set in November 2021. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment products have now seen inflows for 14 weeks running, with total assets under management reaching $220 billion. The surge in popularity for ETH funds follows a pretty sluggish debut last summer. At the time, a report from crypto trading firm Wintermute warned "the absence of a staking mechanism" may diminish the appeal of ETFs launched by the likes of BlackRock. Recently, the BlackRock asked the SEC to reconsider allowing it to stake a portion of the ETH it holds in its iShares Ethereum Trust. This latest data also underlines how important institutional inflows have become to Bitcoin's value continuing to rise, with the biggest digital asset by market capitalization currently trading at $118,244 and down 2.8% on the week. Recent research from the London-based custody firm Copper shows BTC's price increases by an average of 1.8% for every 10,000 coins added to ETF holdings. While analysts noted that BTC ETFs have accumulated 165,000 coins since market lows back in April, they warned slower trading in the summer months may affect momentum. Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to correct the weekly Ethereum ETF inflows figure and also note the Bitcoin flows for the week.

Title: Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ally Apple needs – analyst

Update font size. Reset Apple might benefit from an external AI partnership, and Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ideal match, says Melius’s Ben Reitzes. Adam Clark for Barron’s: ‎ Apple’s struggles with artificial intelligence are becoming critical. It needs to do something big to be a real player in that area, and a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ticket required, according to Melius Research. The company recently lost one of its top AI researchers — Ruoming Pang, who led its machine-learning foundation model team — to Meta Platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means the focus is on Apple’s potential to strike a deal with an external AI partner. Melius’s Ben Reitzes says Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ally it needs. “Apple could provide xAI with the users it needs to top [ChatGPT developer] OpenAI in return for giving Apple all the benefits of owning an LLM [large language model] without the capex,” wrote Reitzes in a research note on Monday… “Tim Cook and his team are likely to be rewarded for thinking bolder to accelerate Apple’s AI push, even if they have to step out of their comfort zone.” ‎ MacDailyNews Take: If you’re going to with an external AI partner, why not choose the smartest one? We find xAI’s Grok to be more accurate and useful than Google’s Gemini, ChatGPT, and the rest. In his note, Reitzes reiterated his “Buy” rating and $240 target price on Apple stock. Also of note: We’re going to make Baby Grok @xAI, an app dedicated to kid-friendly content — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2025 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

[Thanks to MacDailyNews Reader “Fred Mertz” for the heads up.] no way in hell BOB, not the sharpest tool in the shed, wants to settle for second-best because… Elon. BOB should be handicapping himself with a Windows PC and Android phone. It’s apropos: Handicaps for the handicapped. That’s right, BOB, you’re a mental retard who is fed narratives by compromised outlets and who dutifully spits them back like the retarded pawn you are. One side makes decisions based on personality in lieu of principles/progress. Two prominent people in our current World, were successful and popular a relatively short time ago. Today, these same two are still successful, but their “popularity” has changed from favor to disfavor in-spite of progress/principle. Who thinks like this? Eff off brute, the horse you rode in on, and the so-called site moderator who never cleans up the shite you spew. xAI’s is too “hitler-ish” (see: last week) for apple to partner with them. also, Elon has added his own views at the system prompt level (instructing xAI to survey what he has said about a subject prior to responding) which also excludes xAI from serious consideration, despite its AI prowess. Elon can do whatever he wants with his own AI company, but it’s anathema to Apple to partner with a company whose views are aligned in lockstep with a single controversial person. I.e. it will never ever happen. Yes, I used to think Elon was the next Steve until he let politics get in the way. Let’s make allowances that he was on drugs when he did the modified Nazi salute. However, what’s his excuse for supporting the German Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. They are a pack of Neo Nazis who deny the Holocaust, are anti-semitic and are just a pack of revisionist low life scum. As far I’m concerned Apple should have nothing to do with Musk. He went from being a libertarian to being a Hitler sympathiser. Great! Your email address will not be published.

Title: WeRide Teams Up With Lenovo to Launch 100% Automotive-Grade HPC 3.0 Platform Powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor Chips

July 21, 2025 09:22 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. GUANGZHOU, China, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today launched the HPC 3.0 high-performance computing platform, jointly developed with Lenovo (HKSE: 0992) and powered by NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) latest DRIVE AGX Thor chips. The new HPC 3.0 platform makes its debut in WeRide's latest-generation Robotaxi GXR — making it the world's first mass-produced Level 4 (L4) autonomous vehicle built on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. Fully automotive-grade, HPC 3.0 reduces autonomous driving suite cost by 50%, paving the way for GXR's large-scale commercial deployment. WeRide's HPC 3.0 platform, featuring a dual NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor configuration running the safety-certified DriveOS, is built on Lenovo's AD1 L4 autonomous driving domain controller — delivering up to 2,000 TOPS of AI compute. It is the most powerful computing platform available to support L4 autonomy. The HPC 3.0 platform, developed by WeRide and Lenovo, features dual NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor chips and is the most powerful computing platform for L4 autonomy Beyond core upgrades, HPC 3.0 boosts system integration, cutting mass production costs to a quarter of HPC 2.0 and reducing autonomous driving suite cost by 50%. It also consolidates key modules such as Ethernet gateway, CAN gateway, inertial navigation, and collision detection, reducing both production and maintenance expenses. This lowers HPC 3.0's total cost of ownership (TCO) by 84% over its lifecycle compared to its predecessor. HPC 3.0 is certified to AEC-Q100, ISO 26262, and IATF 16949 standards. Its redundant design architecture meets the highest ASIL-D safety level, with a failure rate below 50 FIT (failures per billion hours of operation) and a MTBF (mean time between failures) of 120,000 to 180,000 hours. Built for 10 years or 300,000 km of use, it is capable of operating in extreme temperatures from -40°C to 85°C and passes tests for heat, shock, and corrosion. HPC 3.0 is also fully compliant with global VOCs environmental standards, making it suitable for deployment across the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, and other international markets — supporting WeRide's goal of scaling its Robotaxi fleet worldwide. “Our close collaboration with Lenovo and NVIDIA represents a major breakthrough in computing power, system architecture, and cost efficiency. Integrating the HPC 3.0 platform into our Robotaxi GXR enhances vehicle reliability and responsiveness while significantly reducing deployment costs. Moving forward, we plan to extend this platform across more of our L4 autonomous vehicles — including the Robobus, and Robosweeper — bringing smart, accessible mobility to more cities and customers worldwide,” said Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide. “We're thrilled to see the successful deployment of NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor on WeRide's Robotaxi GXR, marking a significant step towards bringing L4 autonomous vehicles to market at scale. Our close collaboration with WeRide on the AD1 domain controller has been instrumental in accelerating this innovation. Lenovo is committed to leveraging our advanced computing power and working with industry partners to drive the commercialization of autonomous driving solutions globally,” said Donny Tang, Vice President and Head of Lenovo Vehicle Computing, Lenovo. NVIDIA has been a strategic investor in WeRide since 2017 via the NVIDIA Inception program. Ali Kani, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA, also extended congratulations to WeRide. “Robotaxis are reshaping urban mobility, and it’s exciting to witness the progress WeRide and Lenovo have made in deploying a Level 4 autonomous driving system built on NVIDIA accelerated compute and DriveOS,” said Ali Kani, Vice President of Automotive, NVIDIA. “Their achievement marks a significant milestone in helping make safe, scalable, and efficient autonomous transportation a reality.” NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, NVIDIA's successor to DRIVE AGX Orin, is built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and is optimized for the most demanding processing workloads, including generative AI, vision language models and large language models. Its simplified architecture enhances generalization, reduces latency and boosts safety by harnessing powerful NVIDIA accelerated computing to run WeRide’s proprietary AV software stack. As the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi company, WeRide has safely operated Robotaxis on public roads for over 2,000 days. The company continues to scale its technology through global partnerships, delivering safe, efficient, and cost-efficient autonomous mobility. About WeRide WeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry, as well as the first publicly traded Robotaxi company. Our autonomous vehicles have been tested or operated in over 30 cities across 10 countries. We are also the first and only technology company whose products have received autonomous driving permits in five markets: China, the UAE, Singapore, France, and the US. Empowered by the smart, versatile, cost-effective, and highly adaptable WeRide One platform, WeRide provides autonomous driving products and services from L2 to L4, addressing transportation needs in the mobility, logistics, and sanitation industries. WeRide was named in Fortune Magazine’s 2024 “The Future 50” list.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) is experiencing significant momentum. Since it emerged as an independent energy entity in early 2024, its stock has soared nearly 68% year-to-date. This performance isn't merely strong—it far surpasses market expectations, crushing the S&P. So, what is driving this impressive surge? At its essence, GE Vernova is benefiting from a robust energy infrastructure supercycle. With the rapid expansion of AI data centers, electrification, and grid developments, there is a pressing need for infrastructure—and Vernova’s gas turbines, grid technology, and renewable energy solutions are central to this growth. The firm has reported a significant increase in turbine orders, and its backlog has now surpassed $120 billion. This demand is not just busy—it signifies a booked-out-for-years scenario. With the AI boom also playing a role, it becomes clear why major investors are investing heavily. Although GEV stock has shown volatility, if you're looking for potential rewards with less fluctuation than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its launch. When GE separated into distinct companies, Vernova was perceived as the more industrial, slower-growing counterpart. However, that perception has quickly changed. The company has strengthened its balance sheet, enhanced profit margins, and demonstrated impressive execution under its new leadership. All attention is focused on the Q2 earnings report (scheduled for July 23), with expectations soaring. If Vernova continues to exceed projections and demonstrate solid profitability, the upward trend could persist. The AI energy boom shows no signs of fading—and Vernova’s turbines are right at the heart of the action. High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why does this happen? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High

The percentage of Bitcoin’s long-term holders’ supply has reached a 15-year high, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Asset manager Ark Invest highlighted this development in a recent report and explained what this could mean for BTC going forward. According to the Ark Invest report, the long-term holders’ supply has reached 74% of Bitcoin’s total supply, marking a 15-year high for this metric. The asset manager noted that this trend indicates growing market conviction in BTC’s role as a store of value or “digital gold.” These long-term holders refer to addresses that have held for 155 days or longer. This development comes at a time when Bitcoin is witnessing massive demand from institutional investors through the ETFs and treasury companies. These investors are considered better ‘diamond-hands’ than retail investors, which means that this metric could keep rising, with long-term holders gaining more control of BTC’s total supply. This institutional buying has also driven the Bitcoin price to several all-time highs (ATHs) this year, with BTC reaching as high as $123,000 last week. The flagship crypto appears to still be in price discovery, as ETFs led by BlackRock and treasury companies, led by Saylor’s Strategy, continue to accumulate at an unprecedented pace. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is ultra bullish on the Bitcoin price, predicting that it could reach $1.5 million by 2030. They expect BTC to reach this target due to the rising institutional investment and global recognition of Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a store of value. In a CNBC interview, Cathie Wood also doubled down on this prediction. She explained that they expect BTC to take a significant share from gold or grow the store of value market. Wood added that institutions are still just testing the waters despite the massive accumulation so far. As such, she still expects a rise in adoption for these companies. Meanwhile, only about 1 million unmined Bitcoins are remaining. The Ark Invest report also revealed that global liquidity per bitcoin reached a 12-year high. This metric reached this high with $5.7 million in global M2 supply per BTC in circulation. The asset manager remarked that this ratio could continue to rise given Bitcoin’s diminishing future supply growth and the continued expansion of global liquidity. Meanwhile, in June, Bitcoin managed to hold above the support between $96,000 and $99,000 and is now well above these levels. $98,888, $96,278, and $71,393 are BTC’s short-term holder cost basis, 200-day moving average, and on-chain mean, respectively, which is why this development is bullish for the flagship crypto. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $19,100, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: 'Please be careful.' There are risks and rewards as crypto heavyweights push tokenization

The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. “Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France. Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors. But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century’s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood’s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world’s most popular startups. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television. “You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don’t get to choose your program, you couldn’t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.” Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that’s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what’s been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. “Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country’s securities law. Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren’t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private. That’s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.” But Robinhood’s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood’s plan and did not endorse it. “Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.” Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don’t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago. “Where we’re headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn’t understand.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Share this article The Ether Machine, a newly established firm backed by a group of top-tier institutional, crypto-native, and strategic investors, announced Monday its plans to go public on Nasdaq, targeting over $1.6 billion in gross proceeds to build “the largest public Ether generation company.” The Ether Machine is set to trade under the ticker “ETHM” via a business combination with Dynamix Corporation. At launch, the company expects to hold more than 400,000 ETH on its balance sheet. The deal includes a $645 million anchor investment from co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys, representing 169,984 ETH, along with over $800 million in committed capital from backers including Pantera Capital, Kraken, and Blockchain.com “The Ether Machine provides secure, liquid access to Ether – the digital oil that is powering the next era of the digital economy,” said Keys in a statement. “We have assembled a team of ‘Ethereum Avengers’ to actively manage and unlock yields to levels we believe will be market-leading for investors.” The company’s leadership team includes CEO David Merin, former head of corporate development at Consensys, and CTO Tim Lowe, a pioneer in Ethereum staking and institutional blockchain infrastructure. The Ether Machine emphasizes that it isn’t a passive ETH holder like an ETF or treasury, but an actively managed vehicle for institutions to access Ethereum, earn ETH-denominated yield, and participate directly in the ecosystem. The company plans to generate returns through staking, restaking, and decentralized finance strategies. “ETH is the backbone of the digital economy,” explained the team. “It settles $14T+ per year, anchors over $130B in stablecoins, and secures the majority of DeFi activity across the ecosystem. It’s not just a token, it’s collateral, fuel, and native yield.” “ETH generates real yield through staking. It’s burned with usage, making it deflationary. It’s programmable, composable, and used by everything from BlackRock to Uniswap. ETH is the reserve asset of Web3,” the team added. According to the company’s announcement, the deal represents the largest all-common-stock financing announced since 2021 and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Title: Screaming – Nuclear War Is Coming! “All This is Made Up to Scare You”. Peter Koenig

How wise is it to blast out threats of nuclear war almost non-stop? The financial investment advisory guru, Martin Armstrong, has just issued another such warning to the world: 100% Chance of Nuclear War – Martin Armstrong | Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog, by Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com. Six weeks ago, legendary financial and geopolitical cycle analyst Martin Armstrong was signaling a big turn toward war. Now, Armstrong says, “The chances of war with a nuclear exchange is at 100%. . .. Plan on it, this is coming.” The continuous yelling “Wolf” is obnoxious in many ways, because it has the intention to bring fear to the people, to make them morally weak, as they are afraid. The long-term effect is that people do not believe the warning anymore, even if and when it could become true. Which it will not. In the case of Armstrong, who introduces his reputation by pretending having predicted every major (financial) crisis in the past, it may have to do with attracting investors into the war industry or any associated high-yielding investments. In any case, I dare say, scaring people without any solid evidence, i.e., “The chances of war with a nuclear exchange is at 100%. . .. Plan on it, this is coming,” is outright criminal. Fear achieves making people submissive, obedient, as they are afraid of authorities, of the unknown their beloved authorities may bring and so they give in against their own interests. In the case of yelling “nuclear war is coming,” people suddenly turn to NATO for fake security, as they believe war will bring them Peace. Armstrong is part of the “controlled opposition”, though not much opposition is seen, just aberrant warnings. He may get his instructions from the Deep State – or some military industrial monster. Who knows, maybe NATO. See this for Armstrong’s full article and “100% nuclear warning.” NATO is the world’s largest and most dangerous war and killing machine. Wars and conflicts initiated or participated in by NATO have caused at least 30 to 35 million deaths since its creation in 1949. People are so scared that they lose reason and act not only against their own interests, but against the interests of the world at large. This phenomenon of senselessness and mindlessness has been well-studied and softly propagated by Tavistock, the world’s foremost social and mind engineering institute based in the UK, and illustrated in George Orwell’s book “1984”, where logic was turned upside down, literally into War is Peace and Peace is War. When recently President Trump bombed Iran, he said something to the effect, he hopes his bombing of Iran will lead to lasting Peace. And surely, more than a handful people believed him. Worse, NATO, sort of abandoned by the US, is becoming a European “force de frappe” where every country is investing their resources, stretching to huge debt, into armament, into the war industry and mostly the US weapons manufacturers because they are not (yet) very important in Europe. The head of NATO, who has been put in his position by Washington and the World Economic Forum (WEF), will make sure that the US, inventor and creator of NATO (in April 1949, in Washington DC), also benefits from the European fear and war machine. All means are good to create fear and submissiveness. It is one of the first steps towards full enslavement and tyranny. Armstrong and his ilk are just one “civilian” branch. More important are all those European heads of government, implanted, literally with fake elections, all trained by the WEF’s Academy for Young Global Leaders (YGL), and the chief backers of the WEF. They include US and international financial institutions, such as BlackRock, Vanguard and StateStreet – and others, lesser-known financial interests – all eventually leading to the City of London, an independent enclave within London, where most if not all, of the financial and economic manipulations originate. And guess who controls the City of London? Yes, you are right. Those people who are not to be mentioned, lest you are ready to be prosecuted for discriminatory remarks. The current Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, former Dutch Prime Minister, is one of them, a WEF YGL. He makes sure that the 30 European NATO members (the other two are the US and Canada) – most of them also European Union members, follow the trend of War is Peace and Peace is War – as a doctrine that after one or two generations can hardly be erased from the minds of the populace at large. The US has a 1.3 trillion dollar budget foreseen just to renew and build up their nuclear arsenal by 2035. The EU wants a trillion euros military budget by 2030, literally to go to war with Russia. This is openly said by Madame Ursula Von der Leyen, unelected President of the European Commission (EC). All this is made public to scare you. Or does anyone really believe that European leaders are so stupid to plan a nuclear war that may wipe them out as well? As Fidel Castro already said (see this) and many before and after him, including President Putin, a nuclear war is unpredictable and has no winners. What leader in his most submissive mode wants really to wipe out himself, his children, grandchildren, and his loved ones? This sounds like a camouflaged suicide pact. And frankly the world is not quite there yet. So, People and Humanity of this world, stay away from this war propaganda. Think for yourself. Think in the first place Peace, always Peace and Harmony. War has no place in such a scenario, in a world of peaceful cohabitation. You may be amazed to know about the hidden, invisible power of your mind, how it can shape the future, a future that we, The People, choose on our own and step away from what an unnamed elite pretends to choose for the good of Us. Our spirituality is the most powerful means towards harmonious cohabitation we have. Use it. Open your eyes and ears and act for your and humanity’s interests of Peace and harmonious and prosperous togetherness. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: The Impact of the Collapse of Neoliberalism on Global Geopolitics and Türkiye. “The U.S. is No longer a Super Power”. Admiral Cem Gürdeniz
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/impact-collapse-neoliberalism-global-geopolitics-turkiye/5895577

Donald Trump‘s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which includes $5 trillion in public spending submitted to Congress, was approved by a 51–50 vote in the Senate on July 1, 2025, thanks to a vote by Vice President J.D. Vance, and became law on July 4. This law is directly related to the collapse of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, which is the carrier of the system in the post-Cold War period, has worked through tools such as globalization, deregulation, and financialization. However, the pandemic, energy wars, supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions have ushered in a period in which the state is back on the scene. Contrary to the “small state” mentality at the core of neoliberalism, Trump is increasing public investment and borrowing with $5 trillion in spending, and he is promoting “statist” policies with subsidies for defense, infrastructure and industry. This development shows that market discipline has given way to voter satisfaction. Neoliberalism, especially after 1980, led to a disproportionate power of finance capital. In 2024, the world economy is $110 trillion, while financial derivatives total $730 trillion. That is seven times the real economy. For example, for 100 million barrels of oil consumption, six billion barrels of virtual trade are returning. These financial assets are mostly controlled by U.S. banks, BlackRock, the Soros Foundation, Rothschild & Co, Palantir and the City of London etc. financial giants. This structure wants neoliberalism to continue. However, the U.S. administration aims to return to industry, promote production and reduce dependency like the Chinese model. The new law emphasizes the visible power of the state and becomes a symbol of the post-neoliberal era. Instead of shrinking the state and growing the economy, strategic economy and strong state are preferred. Major crises have always enlarged the state rather than the market. Today, in the West, too, the state has returned not only as a regulator, but also as an investor, a directive and, when necessary, an aggressive actor. After the OPEC crisis in the 1970s, the effectiveness of Keynesian policies declined. These crises accelerated the shift towards neoliberal policies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Neoliberalism, which rose under the leadership of Thatcher and Reagan in the 1980s, reached its strongest form until the 1990s with the free market, privatization, deregulation, financialization and globalization. In the aftermath of the Cold War, neoliberalism set the economic and political groundwork for three generations with the promise of globalization and democratization. Although initially offering temporary successes such as economic growth, neoliberal policies have in the long run deepened inequality, weakened social safety nets, and set the stage for the 2008 global crisis. Neoliberal policies have eroded the middle class, led to an unprecedented concentration of wealth at the top, and an unprecedented injustice in income distribution. In 2024, 45-50% of the world’s wealth was in the hands of the richest 1%. The five richest people had more wealth than 3.5 billion people combined. After the pandemic, the wealth of the rich 1% increased by more than $34 trillion. Neoliberalism has been deliberately promoted by big business and financial elites. Free trade agreements have weakened workers’ rights and strengthened multinational corporations. Low taxes and limited social spending worked in favor of capital. The deregulation of financial centers led to crises such as 2008. This process undermined the claim that the market would be self-regulating; State interventions have become inevitable. After 2008, while the big banks were bailed out, people lost their jobs and homes, which created anger and insecurity. In the process combined with COVID-19, supply chain shocks and the Russia-Ukraine war, the neoliberal model has become questionable not only economically, but also politically and geopolitically. Inequalities, polarization and security threats constituted the fundamental ruptures that led to the end of neoliberalism. At the height of neoliberalism in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was believed that every problem would be solved by the invisible hand of the market, that states would remain in the background, and that technocrats would find rational solutions to everything. However, after 2008, the opposite transformation took place. Countries that were supposed to develop with IMF prescriptions were left in debt, and the Western middle class, which believed that everything would become cheaper with free trade, became poorer. As the market collapsed, a political climate emerged that sanctified the state, prioritized the national interest, and said “my property, my security, my data.” Image: Friedrich Hayek (CC BY-SA 3.0) While populism and protectionism were the counterpart of globalization in the West, China and Russia in the East came to the fore with geopolitical moves that declared the legitimacy of the statist model. The golden age of globalization has begun to fade in the shadow of nation-states. Companies have shortened their supply chains governments have made self-sufficiency a priority in strategic areas. Major economies have declared economic security as part of national security. While there was a crisis in every field from masks to chips during the pandemic period, the West abandoned its globalist identity overnight and turned to nationalism. Even the IMF has started to support public investment and social spending after the pandemic. Policies that used to be criticized as “protectionism” were brought to the fore. Hayek and Friedman, the fathers of neoliberalism, may not have aimed at these outcomes directly, their vision was based on the ideal of individual freedom. However, this ideal turned into an order that opened up unlimited space for the owners of capital. This, in turn, increased social and political instability, paving the way for the rise of populism and authoritarian tendencies. Neoliberalism appears to have collapsed ideologically, but it still retains its political influence. But state ownership is getting stronger. Expropriation in areas such as water, energy and transportation is on the agenda again. While the role of the state is gaining importance again with inflation and crises, discussions on the transition to the public model are spreading, even if democratic-socialist alternatives do not reach the hegemonic level. Leaders like Trump are abandoning the free market and turning to pro-capitalist nationalist policies. This indicates that neoliberal norms are being replaced by authoritarian and protectionist models. Social democrats are also discussing more egalitarian, publicist economic models. China’s model of state capitalism and non-Western development paths are gaining legitimacy. Western-centered finance capitalism is being replaced by a hybrid structure in which state capitalism, digital surveillance, and technological control are intertwined. While this process continues, the US and the EU, backed by the power of finance capital, still claim global leadership, but China is getting closer to its goal of becoming the new center in technology and the financial system. Countries such as Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa put their cards on the table. The increasing resistance to the US in the Global South and the alternative systems developed by China with digital payment systems are shaking the hegemony of the dollar. Although Trump has tried to put pressure on BRICS countries with tariffs between 10% and 40%, it is a remarkable result that only three agreements have emerged from the negotiations with 90 countries. Although Trump attacked it with great contempt, BRICS, which represents a population of 3.5 billion, reached 11 full members with the latest enlargement. At the same time, 69% of the trade between the 11 countries is carried out outside the US dollar. On the other hand, global supply chains are polarized with new options. Energy markets are fragmenting. For example, new energy-mining cartels are forming between Russia, China, the Middle East and Africa. The fragmentation of globalization is turning transportation and energy lines into an area of competition and conflict. Transportation projects such as the Belt and Road, the Middle Corridor, the North-South and IMEC are turning into military and ideological fields rather than economic. Rare metals are becoming the dominant commodity in the geopolitical struggle with the role played by oil at the beginning of the 20th century. On the other hand, institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO, the bastions of neoliberalism, are being dragged into a crisis of legitimacy. Regional currencies, bilateral trade, and alternative financial systems are on the rise. As the ideal of the “global citizen” recedes, nationalism and sovereignty return to the center of politics. Divisions within the EU are creating a post-Brexit domino effect. The free-market discourse is being rewritten, this time with government funding, subsidies and digital supervision. However, what remains unchanged in essence is the continued capacity of capital, which has a foam of 730 trillion dollars, to concentrate power and produce inequality. In the new era, global standards and institutions are weakening, and local rules and bilateral agreements are coming to the fore. Many countries trade in their own currencies. For example, even Egypt, which is under pressure from Israel and the United States, can switch to China’s CIPS system instead of the US-controlled international money transfer system SWIFT. Neoliberalism was imposed not only as an economic model, but as a kind of geopolitical ideology. Because the promise of this ideology was: “The world will become a single market, countries will produce prosperity from competition, borders will lose their importance.” In a world where the United States and the collective west are hegemons, this economic ideology has been added to the American geopolitics of the belt and the sea. After the 1980s, neoliberalism achieved global dominance through globalization under the protection of the US dollar, American military power, alliance system, and military bases. The end of the Cold War with the victory of the United States and the collapse of the communist bloc led the representatives of the US neocons and finance capital to the establishment of the New American Century, including the security geopolitics of Israel. The expansion of neoliberalism was aimed with imperialist initiatives such as post-modern colonies, access to unlimited resources, the formation of new markets, and the Greater Middle East and North Africa Project. As Yugoslavia disintegrated, the United States encouraged the prolongation of the civil war to intervene in Europe and prove that American military power was indispensable for Europe. Thus, with the end of the Cold War, the disintegration of Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia and then Yugoslavia was achieved in the first decade. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the EU’s independent military identity has been weakened, while NATO’s expansion has been ensured in line with the process of containment and disintegration of Russia. NATO was promoted from 16 to 32 members. NATO was used in Afghanistan even though it had no area of authority and responsibility. The post-September 11, 2001, Global War on Terror paradigm and the civil wars and occupations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen not only brought death and destruction, but also initiated unprecedented mass refugee flows to many countries, especially in Europe. In short, the geopolitics of neoliberalism combined with American and Israeli geopolitics brought chaos, instability and death to the whole world. In this process, wars such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria were not won but were continued uncessantly. The interventions were created not for victory, but to feed the defense industry and lobbies. The endless wars of the United States today are still determined not by national interests, but by the interests of finance capital and the military-industrial complex. Neoliberalism was the global order of exploitation shaped by the finance capital world, intertwined with the US and the EU, in the triangle of the IMF, the World Bank and NATO. This order is collapsing, and the hegemony’s response to this collapse is taking place with a great reckoning in the geopolitical arena. This process is taking place with provoked proxy wars and hybrid wars. While economic wars are waged with embargoes, sudden tax/tariff increases, seizures of competitors’ assets in banks, sanctions, exclusion operations from financial systems such as SWIFT, cyber-attacks, data theft, blocking access to rare metals and the technological war continues with the technology embargo. On the other hand, psychological warfare through media manipulation, spreading fake news, and creating perceptions with reverse flag operations continues to be an important front of the hybrid war. While proxy wars and crises continue in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, Libya, Iran and Israel, the risk of conflict in Moldova, Kaliningrad, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Serbia and Kosovo is rising. The strategy of the Trump era, which stood against neoliberalism and globalization but could not resist Israel and the Zionist structure, was to bring Russia closer to the West and cut it off from China. This strategy was opposed by Britain, an island state. In the struggle between Trump’s MAGA group and the globalists, British influence prevailed, using the Zionist lobby, and Trump backed down. Therefore, Trump’s strategy of rapprochement with Russia has failed, on the contrary, the Sino-Russian alliance has strengthened. From the beginning, China saw Russia’s defeat as a threat to its own existence. Because if Russia is defeated and disintegrated, Eurasia will be torn apart. On the other hand, after 2001, the U.S. turned into a proxy for finance capital and Zionism rather than a protector of its own interests. The aggressive foreign policy of the United States has led to the emergence of a global counter-alliance led by Iran, China and Russia. The U.S., Israel, and the collective West initially thought that states such as Iran, China, and Russia would give up easily. Washington’s geopolitical mistakes have led to a permanent change in the global order. The situation made by Russia, US and EU strategists before 2022 proved the opposite. It has now become clear that Russia, which sees NATO’s expansion to the east as an existential threat, will oppose the scenarios that the collective West will provoke not only with Ukraine but also with other scenarios unless its own geopolitical guarantees are met in the new period. Russia, whose hand has become stronger in Ukraine, will not stop until Ukraine surrenders unconditionally. China, on the other hand, will not allow Taiwan to turn into an American base 60 miles away, like NATO’s expansion. Taiwan is to China what Cuba is to the United States. The decline of the USA in every field, especially its drift into a position of succumbing to Israel’s blackmail, has eliminated its characteristics of being the center of attraction and determining the rules. To this day, all empires have collapsed when they expanded beyond their capabilities and retreated for wars they could not sustain. Today, the United States faces three major and important competitors at the same time. It is in an active struggle against Russia in Ukraine, Iran in the Middle East, and China in the Pacific. These three fronts are pushing the United States, which is already polarized at home and has come to a civil war environment, beyond its capacity. Another reason for this situation has to do with military power. In particular, the decline in military logistics integration based on production power, the inadequacy of shipbuilding capacity is challenging the USA. The stocks for long-range attack and critical air defense missiles stocks are diminishing to the levels of not in months, to the weeks and days. The two most important examples of this vulnerability can be given with Trump’s withdrawal in the face of the Yemeni Houthis and the offer of a ceasefire to Iran with the mediation of the United States after Israel’s failure to stop Iranian attacks during the 12-day Iran-Israel war. On the other hand, NATO is not only weakened in terms of conventional power but also faces serious constraints and challenges in its decision-making process. It is almost impossible for 32 members to reach full unanimous agreement on any issue. China and Russia have much more sustainable combat readiness, decision-making and combat capabilities. This situation increases the transformation of protracted wars such as the Ukraine crisis into a war of attrition and the risk of the use of nuclear weapons. On the other hand, today’s ongoing wars and economic arm wrestling are radically changing the geopolitical distribution of power. Rather than classical polarization, the new system has become a multi-faceted but fragile, semi-complex (chaotic) structure in which centers compete. In addition to traditional global power centers such as the USA, the EU, China and Russia, regional powers such as India, Iran, Türkiye, Brazil and Saudi Arabia are now also involved in the game as actors. It can be said that we are at a historical turning point for the world in this emerging picture. Today, U.S. foreign policy is shaped by “neocon” ideology and powerful interest lobbies (especially the Israel lobby). The geopolitical picture that will emerge in the new multipolar world model will depend on the decision of the aggressive neocon and Zionist camp of the USA. By turning to internal reforms, Washington can abandon the era of constant wars and provocations and choose the path of compromise and choose a path that respects the balance of power and does not encourage war, like the cold war era. Or it can persist on the current path and risk a major war between the great powers, which would increase the risk of the use of nuclear weapons. Israel occupies a special place in this equation. With its narrow geography, its small population but its ability to operate with secret services, military and special forces far beyond its power, and most importantly, its unruly destruction power even if it commits crimes amounting to genocide, it maintains the feature of being the mafia state of the USA and the EU, or rather the financial capital world. However, the country is in a state of serious polarization and economic crisis. Netanyahu’s strategy of perpetual war to stay in power is in fact darkening Israel’s future. While a state of perpetual war is profitable for both the defense industry and finance capital, it has devastating implications for the long-term security and prosperity of the United States too. In this context, Netanyahu’s geopolitical faits accompli to the United States cause the new world order to be established in an uncontrolled mess instead of a controllable one. In this context, the difficulties faced by Israel and the United States, especially in the last four days of the 12-day war with Iran, did not go unnoticed by the whole world. Israel’s planned strategy of “one-shot destruction” has failed. The U.S.-Israeli attacks have increased Iran’s resilience. This situation strengthened the front of resistance against the US-led hegemony. In short, the new period can be called a period of multipolar chaos in which no bloc can fully dominate and revolves around the “fragile alliances” established by regional powers with short-term interests. In this environment, markets struggle to find confidence; Investments are limited by regional stability. Economic growth slows down, financial crises become more frequent and unpredictable. In this respect, in the new period we have entered, blocs based on temporary cooperation, fragile alliances, friendships and in short, chaos are now the new normal. In this environment, transport and energy corridors, financial systems and digital infrastructures have become strategic fronts. Under these conditions, we can talk about four different geopolitical fronts. While the Western Bloc consists of the USA, the EU, the UK, Israel and Japan; China, Russia, Iran, Belarus and North Korea are blocs in Eurasia. While India, Brazil and South Africa are emerging in the Global South, Türkiye (although act in accordance with the US, Britain and Israel), Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Mexico are also emerging as independent regional powers. In addition to these developments, the geopolitical advantage of the United States decreases as the blocs become stronger, and the Washington Consensus loses its meaning. BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the EU’s quest for strategic autonomy, and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries’ own visions are now taking their place against the USA. In this period of turmoil, we can say that China and Russia have long-term, patient and deep strategies. To break this resistance, the Collective West continues its psychological warfare and various conspiracies and provocations, but it is failing day by day. . Members, Partners and Outreach invitees on the sidelines of 17th BRICS Summit at Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil on July 07, 2025. (GODL India) . The fact that the U.S. is losing power and standing by Israel, which has committed war crimes amounting to genocide, encourages these organizations and states to act in their own interests. On the other hand, Trump’s ego-driven tariff war is destroying the credibility of the United States. The collapse of the global free market is creating new power vacuums, especially in Africa, Central Asia and South America. These gaps trigger proxy wars and regional rivalries. In this environment of real uncertainty and confusion, the era of military alliances and bilateral military cooperation agreements on which traditional military blocs, especially US hegemony, are based, is entering a new phase. Many countries, especially NATO members, which have felt themselves under the assurance of the USA until today, are redefining their national security and defense industries and focusing on national production. The fact that England and France on July 10 and Germany and Britain on July 17, 2025 signed the nuclear cooperation and defense agreements are clear proofs that NATO provides a security guarantee on paper. In short, even in the collective west, the policy of self-sufficiency in security comes to the fore. Today, the new state-controlled nationalism and protectionism in technology, defense and digital infrastructure are becoming the new normal. The wars of the new era are not only military, but also have technological, intelligence and psychological dimensions. Strategic autonomy, national defense and geopolitical awareness come to the fore in state administration. As in the cases of Syria and Iran, the collapse of countries’ air defense systems becomes a necessary condition for regime change, occupation and psychological warfare. Electronic warfare and intelligence-backed sabotage, unorthodox tactics that create an asymmetrical effect replace the classic military intervention. Especially after what happened in the Ukraine, Russia and Israel-Iran conflict, Russia-China-Iran cooperation against the collective West and Israel has become an existential necessity on the axis of air defense and cyber security. The United States is no longer a superpower. The U.S. doesn’t produce, it lives on debt, but the post-1991 power psychology persists, while it is weak and polarized. In this context, social resistance and resilience are very low. Young people, in particular, are questioning the US administration’s unconditional support for Israel. The prohibition of defending Palestine through fascistic measures pushes the young population to oppose Israel. 50% of the population opposes military aid to Israel. In short, its military, economic and strategic capacity has been weakened. They are still weak in the face of the continental powers with the old doctrines focused on sea-air power. Even in the field of maritime power, where it is the strongest, US is in a serious decline against China. While the new world order is evolving into a multipolar form, the old hegemon is trying to start wars and redesign borders in the last stage to gain an advantageous position in the new order. Even if it cannot afford this, it is at least striving to wear down and encircle Russia and China with the chaos and provocations it creates, and at the same time to achieve Israel’s geopolitical goals. In this context, the world is rapidly moving towards a major catastrophe, including the risk of nuclear war. The Ukraine War is no longer just a regional conflict. It has turned into an existential struggle between the West (US-NATO) and the China-Russia axis. The problem is that there are no wise and virtuous leaders who can avert this catastrophe. Today, the most fundamental problem of the NATO states and the countries in the US club is that although they were elected, these leaders came to power with the facilitation of the establishment under the guidance of the Zionist lobby, strong intelligence and secret services, especially in the USA. Today, many of them are personalities raised by the global financial capital system. Decision-making in Washington is dominated by populism, ignorance and vested interests. Leaders like Trump make decisions based on marketing and image management, not strategic knowledge. These weaknesses are dragging the U.S. into both economic collapse at home and uncontrolled conflicts abroad. None of those in charge in the US and the EU have strategic depth. Leaders only know how to win elections. Foreign policy, on the other hand, is guided by lobbies and consultants. Today, in Europe, which prides itself on being the cradle of democracy, the leaders that the people want and tend to are neutralized either by conspiracies or by legal coups (e.g., France, Germany, Romania). Elected leaders turn their countries into a tool or even extras used at the disposal of finance capital, especially the USA, and make decisions against the will of the people. The peoples of the EU countries are being dragged into the continuation of the Ukraine-Russia war for the EU administration under the command of US geopolitics and finance capital, because of which they face expensive energy, deindustrialization and refugee flows, in the final analysis, they become impoverished and ready for a social explosion. Those who come to power with the will of the people are also faced with the punishment of finance capital in a short time and their countries are forced to go bankrupt. (Example, Syriza Party and Greece) Another problem is that the secret services act against the will of the government. In particular, the operations carried out by the CIA, MI6 and Mossad in the field are often out of control, indicating that democratic control mechanisms are weakening. This carries the risk of unpredictable crises because of reverse flag operations, and small events turning into big wars. Most importantly, there is a risk that the United States will resort to war to get out of the economic crisis, as it has done in history. The same option was applied by Britain in 1914 at the beginning of the First World War. The most fundamental factor that prevents this risk, that is, a global world war, is that we are in the era of nuclear power. In short, as the American century comes to an end, the world is moving towards either a controlled division of spheres of influence or a period of chaos that will continue with instability and endless wars. In both scenarios, there are serious pitfalls as well as historical opportunities for many countries. It is very important to be on the right side here. Being indecisive is the most dangerous. Either the US hegemony, which desires the continuation of the old exploitation order in the new period, or the decision to take part in the resistance front that resists it is getting closer day by day. The multi-front crisis spiral that the U.S. has fallen into means both a threat and an opportunity for Türkiye at the same time. In this new conjuncture, rapidly moving away from the unipolar security approach. It is now inevitable to develop multifaceted diplomacy, alternative alliances and independent defense capacity. In this new era, while the traditional superpowers are weakening, old alliances are disintegrating, and new blocs are emerging. In such a situation, a realistic, flexible and national interest-oriented strategy for Türkiye is no longer a choice, but a necessity. Although Türkiye’s NATO membership continues to offer an advantage on paper, excessive dependence on this alliance leads to strategic blindness, and the development of alternative security mechanisms becomes an irrevocable necessity. Today we are in a transitional period in which neoliberalism is beginning to unravel, the major ideological and economic theses have collapsed, but the rules of the new order have not yet been written. In this interim period, countries such as Türkiye will either remain a passive figure in the order established by others, or they will rise to the role of playmaker by building their own strategic architecture. The path to this choice is clear: institutionalized state mind, science-technology and human resources investments based on merit and virtue, social consensus and building resilient structures in the secular, democratic nation-state model. While the global legitimacy of neoliberal ideology has collapsed, the struggles for power and wealth have not ended. And it won’t. The scene has changed, the actors have diversified, and the rules are still waiting to be written. Who will be the rule-maker in this uncertain game will shape the future. As the unipolar world comes to an end, the necessity for Türkiye to recover its domestic front, to form an independent strategic mind, to develop multifaceted cooperation and its own defense capability is more pressing than ever. However, Türkiye’s current orientation cannot respond to this need with both the government and the opposition. The current foreign policy line, guided by the US, the UK, the EU and NATO, contradicts our historical principles of independence. In the case of Syria, the approach of being a tool for proxy wars should be abandoned and regional strategies should be created that focus directly on Türkiye’s security. Today, Türkiye is experiencing a new version of the Tanzimatist orientation that began in 1946 with the abandonment of Ataturk’s independent, non-aligned foreign policy line. At that time, the identity of the United States as a war winner and its economic power were the center of attraction. Not today. However, Türkiye is still pursuing this collapsing order and trying to implement the prescriptions written in western capitals. Moreover, this process has dangerous consequences in domestic politics. The vision of Neo-Ottomanism guided by the American Ambassador, weakens the unifying power of Turkish identity with the separation of ummah and nation, and threatens the secular, nation-state structure with new constitution discussions. The PKK’s political legitimacy by ignoring its terror past causes great wounds in the conscience of the people. While the 5% contribution of water and agriculturally rich Southeastern Anatolia to the Turkish economy shows the strategic importance of this region in the future, it is a vital necessity that every constitutional amendment to be made is shaped by the support of the people. Otherwise, this process may turn into a “honey trap” and destabilize Türkiye. Similar weaknesses are observed in foreign policy. Due to the scandalous wrong policies pursued in Syria, we have now become de facto border neighbor with Israel. Drilling and seismic surveys have been suspended in the Blue Homeland since November 2020. Such geopolitical adventures could put our homeland, such as Southeastern Anatolia, at risk. The Republic of Türkiye was founded after a great war of independence. Thousands of martyrs were lost for the sake of these lands and borders. Now, we are expected to be extras in the scenario of a “puppet Kurdish state with access to the sea” drawn by the US and Israel. This is unacceptable. Türkiye, as a medium-sized power, should strengthen its strategic position based on flexible diplomacy, regional leadership and institutional effectiveness. The biggest threat today is being open to foreign interventions due to internal political polarization, lack of strategic vision, and institutional weakness. Instead of blindly trusting the U.S., it is essential for Türkiye to develop independent reflexes. In military policy, it should focus on its own security priorities rather than being a tool of the United States’ interest-oriented wars. Diplomatically, the opportunities offered by alternative structures such as BRICS should be evaluated. Israel should be reacted to not only with words, but also with deeds (such as the closure of the Kürecik base and the cessation of the flow of oil in the BTC Line). Economically, resilient structures should be built that will not be affected by US-centered crises. The strategic mind, on the other hand, should not be rote but realistic, cool-headed and agile. Türkiye’s tactical and strategic air defense should be completed in a short time with national resources. Based on military cooperation with Russia and China, long-range hypersonic ballistic missile technology should be developed as soon as possible. The Kaan Fighter Jet project should be prioritized and our air power should be renewed. Emphasis should be placed on strengthening our submarine fleet, which is Türkiye’s greatest deterrent force, with the MILDEN project, the resources allocated to surface power should be transferred to the strengthening of our submarine fleet, and Türkiye’s full control of the underwater in the Eastern Mediterranean should be guaranteed as a basis. In this context, all kinds of measures should be taken to start mass production of AKYA, the heavy torpedo for our submarines. It should be considered that our electronic warfare and cyber defense infrastructure is established, and that the software, communication and GPS infrastructure, which we are dependent on the West and Israel, are backed up with Chinese and Russian systems while nationalizing. Türkiye is entering a very difficult period with a fragmented domestic front. The geopolitical blindness of the opposition and the government in the Blue Homeland, the TRNC and our Southeast make new geopolitical suicides inevitable. Military hospitals are closed, military high schools are closed, military academies are not affiliated with the Forces. The material and moral dimensions of the damage to our armed forces caused by FETÖ, or rather by the CIA, MI6, BND and Mossad, with the internal collaborators are indescribable. In such a conjuncture, Türkiye is trying to move away from the nation-state, unitary structure and secularism step by step under the guidance of the USA and Britain. While most of the people are overwhelmingly loyal to Atatürk, the republic and its basic principles, it is not possible to understand the minority’s desire for geopolitical and regime changes in good faith. Despite declining American hegemony and collapsing neoliberalism, acting in accordance with the religious and ethnic dividing policies they love so much, is tantamount to heading the iceberg on the Titanic bridge when you know she will sink. Neither the power of the Turkish nation nor its glorious history will agree to this course. There is no other course of salvation than the Kemalist prescription written by Atatürk 100 years ago. I hope that it will be possible for our state and nation to see this fact before it hits the bottom. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin price to hit $917,000 by next cycle from combined institutional predictions

Looking at all institutional Bitcoin predictions being made right now. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Following a new all-time high in dollars, Bitcoin price predictions are flooding in alongside diverging institutional theses, ranging from macro-driven valuations to long-tail adoption models. A wave of bold projections from six to nine figures with disparate assumptions underpinning each outlook. With predictions varying across time frames from this year to 2030, the table below shows a breakdown of the average Bitcoin price targets currently being forecast. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently reiterated her thesis that Bitcoin could reach $2.4 million by the decade’s end. Wood cited growing institutional demand and BTC’s monetary properties as foundational to ARK’s model. While the $2.4 million target represents the upper band, ARK has previously outlined a range starting in the low six figures, with a $1.5 million milestone for 2027. Wood’s forecasts are based partly on modeling Bitcoin as a reserve asset replacing allocations to gold and specific sovereign debt instruments, contingent on accelerating institutional flows. Financial advisor Ric Edelman, whose firm DACFP advocates for crypto education among fiduciaries, offered a comparatively moderate $500,000 target by 2030. Edelman framed the target within a 10-40% portfolio allocation to digital assets, positioning Bitcoin as a long-duration asset in a world of declining fiat confidence. While his range is narrower than Wood’s, it is similarly predicated on rising institutional allocation and constrained supply mechanics. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, a persistent advocate for institutional Bitcoin exposure, reaffirmed his long-held belief that passive capital reallocations alone could drive Bitcoin past $1 million. This month, Saylor emphasized the scale of allocators entering ETF channels, which he characterized as irreversible demand flows. This view treats Bitcoin as an apex monetary asset attracting capital in flight from inflation-hedging instruments. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink provided a looser band, offering a projected price window between $500,000 and $700,000 without anchoring to a specific timeframe. Fink’s comments align with BlackRock’s positioning in the ETF market and reflect confidence in regulatory clarity and institutional integration. Fink’s range assumes gradual accumulation of Bitcoin as a treasury or reserve asset, enabled by frictionless financial products. Bank-led projections have trended toward shorter-term outlooks. Standard Chartered’s head of FX and digital assets, Geoff Kendrick, issued a target of $200,000 by the end of 2025. The thesis is grounded in ETF flow momentum, halving forces, and macro hedge demand. Similarly, Bernstein analysts raised their 2025 target to $200,000, citing robust ETF inflows. Both forecasts anchor to post-ETF regime trends and treat 2024’s halving as a catalyst rather than a lagging event. On the more extreme end, Fidelity last year projected a $1 billion valuation per coin by 2038. This extreme target is grounded in network adoption curve analogies, positioning Bitcoin as a potential base-layer financial system and framing the projection as a function of exponential adoption and monetary network effects. The $1 billion thesis reflects a far-end macro transformation scenario rather than a cyclical valuation. Despite stark differences in scale and timing, the shared denominator across all forecasts is the institutional reframing of Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. Whether as a long-term hedge, macro reserve, or internet-native monetary base, the narrative shaping forward price targets continues to be dominated by capital flow models and network entrenchment rather than retail speculation or hype cycles. Each projection reflects a different hypothesis on monetary reconfiguration, and none are immune to regime shifts in regulation, macro policy, or technology. Still, the volume and intensity of public institutional forecasts reflect an increasingly codified role for Bitcoin within long-term capital frameworks. * Does not include $1 billion Hyperbitcoinization target from Fidelity.

Title: Best International Equity ETFs of 2025

Time Published: 2025-07-21T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
With European markets consistently outperforming their US counterparts, investors are eyeing funds tracking foreign companies. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com ETFs are booming in the US, but that doesn’t mean investors are keeping their investments stateside. International equity ETFs that invest in publicly traded companies have surged this year, posting returns of 20% or more and cementing international funds at the top of the heap of the best performing funds of 2025’s first half. The massive gains were due to overperforming European markets and strong performing sectors in other countries. The outperformance in Europe, relative to both the US and international stocks more broadly, can be attributed to an “increased willingness” for those countries to invest in companies that help drive economic growth, said Zachary Evens, a Morningstar research analyst. “Banks and utilities and industrials and communication service companies, like telecoms, these companies are more boring,” he said. “They don’t typically grow very fast, but they benefit from broad economic growth, so a lot of the outperformance has been concentrated in some of those stocks.” European stocks have outperformed their US counterparts for the past three years, reversing a trend of US dominance that began following the Great Recession, with the MSCI EMU Index outpacing the S&P 500 by more than 35 percentage points since 2022, according to Schwab. International stocks in general have also beaten American stocks, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index. Some of the top-performing international markets ETFs so far this year are: Still, diversification is key to avoiding region-specific downturns. “If Spain grows by a lot, but France falters, then diversification will even that out… That also goes for the sector side,” said Evens. “You would be better suited to be more diversified across sectors and countries to minimize those negative impacts.” All Hail the Sector. Sector performance tends to be the main driver of stock performance, with US markets leaning heavily on tech companies in recent years. Still, outside factors — inflation, political deals, tariffs — have an impact on sectors, which in turn affects markets, according to Evens. “What impacts the performance of those sectors would be more idiosyncratic risks or geopolitical factors, or economic factors,” he said. “Weighing those is how investors can think about potential outperformance or underperformance of the respective markets.” The asset manager has asked the SEC to make QQQ an open-end fund, which would benefit Invesco and its shareholders. The company’s latest spin on protected Bitcoin investing includes Calamos ETFs that diversify their exposure to a range of Bitcoin funds. The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The first spot Solana ETF came to market last week through a filing under the Securities Act of 1940, unlike competitors who filed under the 1933 Act. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: CoinEx Research Releases Landmark Report on the RWA Tokenization Revolution

July 21, 2025 04:40 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research, the research division of global crypto exchange CoinEx, has officially released its latest in-depth two-part report: “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Revolution (Part I & II).” The report systematically examines the RWA landscape—from foundational infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to the practical deployment of tokenized asset classes—and signals the arrival of RWAs as a core pillar of the next wave of financial innovation. Key Insight I: The On-Chain Asset Era Is Accelerating The report highlights that RWA tokenization is fast becoming the critical bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As of June 2025, RWA-related protocols have locked $12.7 billion in total value, up 69% year-to-date. Yield-bearing assets such as tokenized U.S. Treasuries and private credit are growing rapidly under clearer regulatory regimes, led by institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Notably, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund alone commands 44% of the tokenized Treasuries market with $2.5 billion in TVL. CoinEx Research believes RWAs are transitioning from early experimentation to institutional-scale adoption, marking a clear inflection point in the on-chain asset revolution. Key Insight II: Five Core Asset Classes Define the Tokenized Financial Landscape In Part II of the report, CoinEx Research analyzes five of the most impactful RWA asset types, detailing how each class is evolving in design, adoption, and regulatory complexity: CoinEx Research emphasizes that as compliance, yield, and liquidity converge, these asset classes will serve as foundational components of an on-chain financial system. Key Insight III: Regulatory Clarity & Infrastructure Enable Institutional Entry The report outlines two critical enablers for mainstream RWA adoption: Over 59% of non-stablecoin RWA value is currently hosted on Ethereum, underlining its institutional composability and regulatory alignment. CoinEx Research’s Outlook: RWAs as the Foundation of On-Chain Capital Markets CoinEx Research concludes that RWAs are not just symbolic tools—they are the building blocks of real on-chain capital markets. With scalable legal, custodial, and compliance systems in place, RWAs are now enabling institutions to enter Web3 with safety, efficiency, and clarity. More than just the ability to “tokenize assets,” the real competitive edge will lie in delivering stable, composable, and transparent real-world financial instruments on-chain. Read the Full Report Both Part I and Part II of “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the RWA Tokenization Revolution” are now available on the official CoinEx Research portal.

Title: Trump sharpens the axe for the Education Department. Swing away, Mr. President. | Opinion
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/07/21/trump-education-department-layoffs/85257106007/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T08:30:58Z
Full Content:
The largest employer in the United States isn't a Fortune 100 company like Alphabet, Amazon or Apple. It's the federal government − and that's a problem. Thankfully, President Donald Trump continues to slash bureaucratic bloat. On July 11, the administration sent layoff notices to more than 1,300 State Department workers, and three days later, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with plans to gut the Department of Education. That's bad news for government employees, but great for taxpayers, especially given the Education Department's expense − $268 billion in the last fiscal year − and its lack of effectiveness. Despite the department's massive budget, students in the U.S. far too often lag behind peers in other industrialized countries. In 2022, for example, American 15-year-olds scored behind peers from 25 other countries on an international math test. And we're losing ground. Math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress continue to decline. Part of the drop can be attributed to pandemic-related learning loss, but reading scores in the U.S. began to decline in 2019 − before Americans had even heard of COVID-19. But how will pulling the federal government out of K-12 education help? It's important to note that more than 90% of public school funding comes from state and local governments along with foundations and other private sources. Much of the federal education budget is used to feed the bureaucracy, which generates rules and regulations that local administrators and teachers must obey. If all of that bureaucratic oversight consistently produced better results, there might be a case for keeping it. But the data clearly shows it doesn't. Removing federal bureaucrats from our schools should give states and local school districts more flexibility to set education policy, and that should improve choices for parents like me. Returning more control to the states also should improve efficiency and enable schools to better meet students' needs. Trump isn't cutting jobs only at the Education Department, of course. The State Department layoffs follow reductions at other federal agencies this spring. The cuts are driven by necessity: Our national debt is now more than $37 trillion, and the annual budget deficit will top $1 trillion again in 2025. So, I was surprised to see news reports paint the laid off State Department workers as heroic. Cameras caught teary goodbyes and applause for well-liked employees. I don't recall the same concern when President Joe Biden halted construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which cost 1,500 workers their jobs and eliminated plans to create thousands more. While job loss is certainly scary, and I don't wish it on anyone, federal job cuts should be put in the context of the overall jobs market. Microsoft has announced that it would eliminate 9,000 jobs, not because the company is failing but because it's retooling as the market changes. Other companies, including Intel and Meta, have announced plans to restructure this year as the emergence of artificial intelligence and other technology changes how Americans work. The federal government should be as flexible as our top companies in adapting to a changing world. Yet, progressives have criticized the Trump administration's efforts to restructure the federal bureaucracy as cruel. The president's job, however, isn't to employ as many bureaucrats as possible. It's to deliver effective services as efficiently as possible to taxpayers. Dismantling ineffective and inefficient bureaucracies like the Education Department is a long overdue step toward achieving that goal.

Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. agreed to form a reinsurance venture with Allianz SE in India, advancing the billionaire’s quest to broaden his reach in the sector. The 50-50 venture combines Jio’s local digital footprint with Allianz’s global underwriting and reinsurance capabilities, the companies said in a statement late Friday. Jio and Allianz also signed a non-binding agreement to set up equally owned general and life insurance businesses in India. Bloomberg News previously reported the companies’ joint-venture plan, which expands Ambani’s footprint in the insurance sector. His Jio Financial already offers digital banking and has struck a deal with BlackRock Inc. for investment-fund services. The agreement with Jio comes after the German insurer sold its holdings in ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. in India. The new reinsurance project will start operating after the companies have received statutory and regulatory approval. India’s insurance penetration — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is about 3.7%, well below other Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to data from the local insurance regulator.

Stablecoin Strategy: Trumpâs team and BlackRock aim to globalize dollar-pegged stablecoins to sustain U.S. financial dominance, channeling capital into Treasuries and delaying a dollar collapse. Digital Currency Takeover: Like past dollarization in Iraq, stablecoins replace local currencies, enforce Treasury demand, and extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years via tech-driven financial control. Surveillance Risks: Critics warn stablecoins could enable CBDC-like social credit tracking, merging finance with national security while exposing corruption (e.g., Brazil tariff schemes). Broader Financial Looting: Links to Pentagon fund gaps, healthcare plunder (e.g., mRNA shots suppressing life expectancy), and Epstein cover-ups reveal systemic elite exploitation. Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup.

President Donald Trumpâs administration is aggressively pushing stablecoinsâdollar-pegged digital currenciesâas part of a strategy to preserve U.S. financial dominance despite soaring national debt, warns financial analyst Catherine Austin Fitts, founder of The Solari Report. In an exclusive interview on Decentralized TV, Fitts revealed that the Trump administrationâalongside figures like BlackRock chairman Larry Finkâaims to internationalize dollar-backed stablecoins, funneling global capital into U.S. Treasuries and delaying an inevitable dollar collapse. "The New Iraqi Pallets of Cash" Fitts compared the plan to past U.S. financial maneuvers, such as flooding post-invasion Iraq with physical dollars to cement dollar reliance. Now, she argues, stablecoins serve as "digital palettes of cash"âcool, tech-savvy vehicles to: Replace local currencies worldwide with dollar-pegged digital money. Force capital into Treasuries, propping up demand for U.S. debt as interest rates spike. Extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years, avoiding a fiscal reckoning. "This is a hostile takeover of global currencies through tech," Fitts said, referencing legislative efforts like the (GENIES Act) to formalize crypto markets under U.S. control. Critics Fear CBDC Backdoor Despite claims of resisting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Fitts warned that dollarized stablecoins could impose social credit surveillance: Example: Brazil tariff front-runningâwhere insiders profited before policy shiftsâshows corruption risks. Real-world control: Palantir- and DoD-backed systems may enforce compliance, merging finance with national security. "Financial Coup DâEtat" Fitts, who documented $21 trillion in missing Pentagon funds (1998â2015), linked the scheme to broader looting: Healthcare plunder: mRNA shots for sick children may artificially suppress life expectancy ("balancing budgets by killing people"). Epstein files erased: Governments buried evidence while VC-backed crypto elites lobbied Washington. How to Resist? Fitts urged pragmatic defiance: Ditch TVsâpropaganda clouds judgment. Stack precious metalsâhedge against currency collapse. Non-corporate entities: Unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) can shield assets legally. Bottom Line Trumpâs stablecoin gambit may salvage the dollar temporarilyâbut accelerates a centralized financial coup. As Fitts bluntly put it: "If you ignore the great poisoning, you wonât survive."

Title: Why Public Pension Funds Should Still Put Beneficiaries First: A Response to Fisch and Schwartz
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/07/21/why-public-pension-funds-should-still-put-beneficiaries-first-a-response-to-fisch-and-schwartz/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T04:05:48Z
Full Content:
In a recent article, professors Jill Fisch and Jeff Schwartz argue that the beneficiary primacy model – requiring pension fund trustees to maximize economic value solely for beneficiaries – fundamentally misunderstands the nature of public pension funds. They contend that public pension funds differ critically from private funds because beneficiaries receive defined benefits that do not vary with fund performance. Unlike mutual fund investors who are residual claimants, public pension beneficiaries have contractual claims to fixed payments. As the two professors note, if a public pension fund outperforms, beneficiaries have no claim to the surplus; it belongs to the government. Their solution is as innovative as it is radical: Treat public pension funds as principals rather than intermediaries. Under their model, fund managers would owe fiduciary duties to the fund itself, not to beneficiaries. This would free managers to balance the sometimes-competing interests of multiple stakeholders – employees, taxpayers, local communities, and beneficiaries – guided by state constitutions, legislation, and investment policies. As they argue, “the political nature of public pensions is a feature, not a bug. I will provide the English law perspective, but the UK principles also apply to some extent to Fisch and Schwartz’s U.S. law analysis. I will examine the roles and duties of pension fund trustees, because as Fisch and Schwartz recognize, public pension funds in the U.S. are typically organized as trusts. It has been argued that under U.S. law, the beneficiary primacy principle is a problem because, among other reasons, fund managers or pension fund trustees are not permitted to take into account ESG factors but must maximize the economic value of the fund. Fisch and Schwartz go further, arguing that this principle creates litigation risk and “delegitimizes values-based fund management decisions,” forcing fund managers to make disingenuous claims that all ESG decisions maximize returns. But while the beneficiary primacy principle is recognized under English law, it is more nuanced. For pension fund trustees to address ESG issues, it is unnecessary and undesirable to reframe a pension fund as a principal to which trustees solely owe duties. This reframing subverts well-established tenets of trusts law and fiduciary law. In my view, under English law, pension fund trustees are already legally permitted, and under certain circumstances may even be legally required, to consider ESG factors, if one of two conditions exist. First, the trustee’s mandate, as stated in the trust deed or legislation allows or requires them to consider these factors. Or second, these factors materially affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries.[1]For example, trust-based pension funds are statutorily required to take into account climate-related risks.[2] To begin with, under English law, the fiduciary duties of pension fund trustees primarily consist of promoting the purpose for which the trust was created. This has been interpreted to require the trustees to balance returns against risks[3]; this is different from the maximization of risk-adjusted returns as stated by Fisch and Schwartz. English law generally permits fiduciary duties to be shaped or qualified by the terms of the trust deed, applicable contract or applicable legislation, such that the scope of fiduciary duties has to be interpreted to permit, and may even require, the pension fund trustees to address ESG factors.[4] Fisch and Schwartz argue that courts “contort themselves” to uphold values-based investment decisions while nominally applying the beneficiary primacy principle. They discuss cases like State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board[5] (upholding mandatory investment in jail bonds) and Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City[6] (upholding required divestment from South Africa) as examples where courts strain to find economic justifications for politically motivated decisions. However, under English law, if the trust deed or legislation permits or requires the trustees to consider or even prioritize environmental, social, political, or other kinds of factors, or to make certain investments, the beneficiary primacy principle, which is part of fiduciary duties, is no obstacle at all. This is because the fiduciary duty has been molded or qualified by the trust deed or legislation. Thus, should the facts of State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board be decided by a UK court, the decision in that case is justifiable because the legislation has given the mandate to the state pension board to invest in jail bonds. Likewise, the decision in the Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City is similarly justifiable because the state law requires the public pension funds to divest from companies doing business in South Africa during the apartheid era. This is because the duties of the pension fund trustees had been qualified by, or had to be interpreted in light of, state law. A real difficulty arises when there is no clear mandate, that is, when the trust deed or legislation is silent as to whether pension fund trustees can take into account ESG factors. Fisch and Schwartz argue this creates an “irresolvable and disingenuous” debate where fund managers must artificially claim that all decisions maximize returns. Their solution is to abandon the beneficiary primacy principle entirely. One answer provided by the beneficiary primacy principle, as described by Fisch and Schwartz, is that pension fund trustees are not allowed to do so because their sole and overriding duty is to maximize the returns of their beneficiaries. But under English law, while pension funds trustees must act in the exclusive interests of beneficiaries, this does not mean they have to maximize returns. Rather, the beneficiary primacy principle requires trustees to balance returns against risks. As the 2024 UK Financial Markets Law Committee (FMLC) makes clear in its important paper, “Pension Fund Trustees and Fiduciary Duties: Decision-making in the Context of Sustainability and the Subject of Climate Change”, pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at three levels:[7] the specific investment level, the portfolio level, and the level of whole economies material to the pension fund. This framework elegantly addresses many of Fisch and Schwartz’s concerns about economically targeted investments (ETIs). They explain how public pension funds have invested in local infrastructure, affordable housing, and small businesses – investments critics condemn as creating politically motivated conflicts of interest. But under the FMLC approach, these can be justified at the third level of analysis. Thus, trustees are allowed to consider ESG or political factors to the extent they constitute material financial risks or opportunities that can affect the returns of the beneficiaries. Should a UK court decide the case of Withers v. Teachers Retirement System of New York City[8], the court is likely to affirm the decision of the fund manager because, had the pension funds not bought the state bonds, the state, which is a major contributor to and guarantor of the funds’ assets, would have become bankrupt. And this would materially affect the returns of the beneficiaries. I do not find the court’s interpretation to be particularly strained. The ETIs, which are designed to benefit low-income earners, can be justified on this basis, because the creation of affordable housing and employment can spur economic growth, which will in turn improve the returns for the beneficiaries. This reasoning may seem tenuous. But recall that under the UK approach, as pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at the whole economies level that are material to the fund, the ETIs can be justified on this basis. It is within the discretionary judgment of pension fund trustees to conclude that a badly performing economy, caused by unemployment, can affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries. Fisch and Schwartz document extensive public pension fund activism on social issues – from New York City Employees’ Retirement System’s 1992 proposal on sexual orientation discrimination at Cracker Barrel to recent fossil fuel divestments. They argue that putting beneficiaries first forces funds to make disingenuous economic arguments for these values-based decisions. In my opinion, even if the pension fund trustees are motivated by their moral or ideological views when they make ETIs or when they consider ESG factors, they may not breach their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. This is because under English law, taking into account non-financial factors is permissible, if two tests are met: first, trustees should have good reason to think that the beneficiaries would share the concern; and second, the decision should not involve a risk of significant financial detriment to the fund.[9] What if the first test is met but not the second? Can the fiduciary still take into account and give effect to these non-financial considerations such as advancing the net-zero agenda or implementing the Paris Agreement? There may be support for an affirmative answer in a 2022 English High Court decision. In Butler-Sloss v. Charity Commission for England and Wales[10], the trustees of two charitable organizations sought a declaration from the court that they were not in breach of their fiduciary duties by aligning their proposed investment policy with the Paris Agreement and therefore with the wishes of their respective charities, even if doing so would lead to lower returns for their beneficiaries. The goals and objectives of the investment policy were to “protect and enhance the trust’s financial returns and support its charitable objectives” and in doing so, “align its investments with the Paris Climate Agreement.” To implement the policy, the trustees decided on an investment that had the highest percentage of green funds but there would be financial detriment in the short term, the precise amount of which the trustees could not determine. The Attorney General and Charity Commissioner took the view that the potential financial detriment would conflict with the trust’s purposes. But the court disagreed, holding that the trustees had discharged their duties and struck the right balance between giving effect to the goals and objectives of the investment policy, which included aligning investments with the Paris Agreement, and the financial detriment that would ensue. In my view, this case suggests that English courts may defer to a fiduciary’s balance between risk-adjusted returns and non-financial considerations – even if it causes short-term financial detriment – provided that the trust’s purpose permits such investments and specifically includes these non-financial objectives. Where the trust lacks such provisions, the fiduciary must ascertain the beneficiaries’ preferences, which may be challenging. Where regulations or guidelines require or expect asset managers, asset owners, and pension fund trustees to make climate-related disclosures, the fiduciary duties of these entities – here the beneficiary primacy principle – have to be interpreted in that light. For example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority has issued similar disclosure rules or guidelines.[11] This means that asset managers must consider climate-related risks as part of their duty to their beneficiaries to balance returns against risks. This is an example of how the common law fiduciary duties have been molded or qualified by regulation. In my view, under English law, it is unnecessary to overturn the longstanding principle that trustees owe duties only to beneficiaries. Nor is it desirable to assert the controversial claim that public pension fund trustees owes duties only to the public pension fund understood as a principal. It is difficult to defend the claim that the public pension fund is a principal when, unlike a company, it is not conferred a separate legal personality by the law. Fisch and Schwartz’s reconceptualization, while intellectually bold, would require fundamental changes to well-established trust law principles. More concerningly, completely severing the link between fund managers and beneficiaries could reduce accountability and potentially enable the political manipulation they elsewhere acknowledge – such as when Louisiana’s State Treasurer stopped investing with BlackRock to protect the fossil fuel industry. The English law approach achieves most of their legitimate objectives – enabling ESG consideration, supporting local investments, and reflecting public values – while maintaining crucial protections against self-dealing and mismanagement. It recognizes that pension fund trustees operate within a framework shaped by legislation, regulation, and trust documents, but preserves the fundamental principle that they must act in their beneficiaries’ best interests, properly understood.

This buoyed the financial sector, which was the lone major sector with a notable gain of about 1.2%, offsetting losses seen in other sectors. Despite the broader market showing some signs of caution, especially as Reliance Industries saw a 3.2% dip due to concerns over softness in its oil-to-chemicals and retail segments, the financial stocks’ performance helped lift the benchmarks. The Sensex also climbed by about 0.5% to nearly 82,200, supported primarily by the banking rally. The mid-cap and small-cap segments remained largely subdued, indicating selective buying focused on quality blue-chip names.

Equirus Capital * RELIANCE posted a resilient 1QFY26 EBITDA of Rs 429bn (+11% yoy, -2% qoq), slightly below EE, with strong growth in R-Jio (+7% qoq EBITDA) and retail (+11% yoy). O2C was steady qoq but missed EE, while upstream remained soft. PAT surged to Rs 307bn (+37% qoq) aided by Rs 89bn gains on Asian Paints stake and higher interest income. * R-Jio continued to anchor growth with rising ARPU, robust net adds, and digital scale-up (broadband, FWA). We model a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E. Retail stayed in recovery with 8-quarter high store adds and margins steady at 7.2%. We expect a 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR as restructuring eases and SSSg normalises. * O2C margins should gradually improve, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27, with easing feedstock pressures and better spreads amid record-low inventories. * Retail scale-up visibility, O2C margin bottoming, and commissioning of New Energy assets support our FY25-FY27E EBITDA CAGR of 19%. Retain ADD with a Sep’26 TP of Rs 1,546. Near-term triggers: Tariff hikes, retail recovery, value unlocking in R-Jio. Jio Platforms – growth visibility strong: R-Jio reported a solid 1Q with 7% qoq/24% yoy EBITDA growth and margins improving to ~52%. Growth was supported by rising ARPU (Rs 209, +15% yoy), strong net adds (10mn), and leadership across wireless (~51% market share), FWA, and broadband. Jio AirFiber subscribers crossed 7.4mn, making it the largest FWA platform globally. As per TRAI (May’25), Bharti Airtel (31% market share) and Vodafone (13%) had 302mn and 127mn subscribers, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, led by rising fixed broadband penetration, modest tariff hikes, and continued subscriber additions. Retail – recovery in motion : Reliance Retail delivered 11% yoy EBITDA growth, aided by continued store expansion (+252 qoq to 19,592). Margins were stable yoy at 7.2% (down 20bps qoq). Digital commerce scaled up strongly – JioMart daily order volumes jumped 175% yoy, and AJIO Rush sustained its early momentum. We expect 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, as store restructuring and SSSg normalise. O2C – margin normalisation to drive modest upside: Despite throughput pressure from planned M&I, EBITDA grew 11% yoy to Rs 145bn, with stable qoq EBITDA/mt at US$ 98. However, higher feedstock and freight costs weighed on qoq profitability. We expect margins to improve steadily, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27. New Energy – execution phase begins: The business is entering a critical execution phase, with large-scale investments underway across solar PV, storage, green hydrogen, and supply chain. Giga-factory commissioning is expected over the next 4-6 quarters. We value the New Energy vertical at 1.5x invested capital, implying a value of ~Rs.1.2tn (5% of total value).

He was joined on the dais by Sanjay Nayar, President Assocham and Sajjan Jindal, Past President Assocham and Chairman JSW Group. Mr. Goyal also said that the EFTA-India FTA agreement will take effect on October 1, 2025. He urged ASSOCHAM members present at the meeting to focus on scale and quality to remain competitive and take advantage of these FTAs. He also highlighted the need to focus on innovation to stay competitive. The event saw the participation of leading CEOs from Indian Industry including Mr. B K Goenka, Chairman Welspun World, Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, Founder & Chairman, Hiranandani Group, Mr. Vineet Aggarwal, Managing Director, Transport Corporation of India Ltd., Mr. M K Sanghi, Chairman, M K Sanghi Group, Mr. Sunil Kanoria, Trustee, Kanoria Foundation, Ms Falguni Nayar, CEO of Nykaa, Mr. Sanjeev Mehta, Executive Chairman, El Carterton India, Mr. Anant Goenka, Vice Chairman, RPG Group and Mr. Gunit Chadha, Founder and MD, APAC Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. among others. Speaking at the event, the minister said the FDI commitment would also create a million direct jobs in the coming years, and help technology and innovation through Swiss SMEs entering Indian markets “My calculation, or my gut sense is that $100 billion FDI, along with Indian promoter equity, when they come into your companies, it will catalyse to at least $500 billion investment in India into brownfield or greenfield,” said the minister. Citing a game-changing initiative, Mr. Goyal said that the cabinet has sanctioned ₹1 lakh crore towards an innovation fund to drive R&D in the country. “When I tell you that a 1 lakh crore rupees, which is about $12 billion, invest it, it’ll multiply through many rotations. It can be given out to all of you or any company willing to do it in, research and development in the form of a grant, in the form of low-cost loan, interest-free loan, long term loan,” said Mr. Goyal. Recognizing the pivotal role of MSMEs, Mr. Goyal stressed the need for enabling these enterprises with access to global markets, modern technology, and affordable capital. With 2.4 million STEM graduates annually, including 43% women, India is well-positioned to scale up its manufacturing and innovation capabilities. Recognising India’s potential as a global capability hub, he said the country can emerge as a high-quality destination for Global Capability Centers (GCCs), as India now offers, comparable or superior talent at a fifth of global costs, lower-than-expected real estate and energy costs, and a compelling alternative to offshore operations, amid declining H1B dependency. On the social security pact with the UK, Goyal said India has successfully negotiated a social security agreement with the UK, enabling Indian professionals on short-term UK work visas (up to 3 years) to contribute Indian EPF accounts rather than losing 25% of their overseas earnings in UK social security contributions. When asked by a delegate on the government’s Bharat Mart initiative, the union minister highlighted plans to replicate a similar model for Indian MSMEs, particularly leveraging Mumbai’s strategic and financial advantage, with government support and incentives promised. On the upcoming EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which mandates supply chain traceability for seven commodities (like coffee, wood, furniture, etc.), requiring detailed farmer and production data to be uploaded, the minister acknowledged this regulation as a non-tariff barrier. He urged Indian industries to proactively engage and negotiate such barriers and emphasised that quality compliance, not just quantity, must be a national priority.

Title: Morris the main man as 7 Tipp stars on Team of Year

Full Content:
Mikey Stafford RTÉ Online Sport Editor History is written by the victors and, as is customary, the All-Ireland champions make up almost half of The Sunday Game Team of the Year. Tipperary's second half blitzkrieg led them to an All-Ireland title that looked as unlikely at half-time of the All-Ireland final as it did at full-time of their Munster SHC defeat to Cork. But Liam Cahill's men were victorious, thanks to a rabid defence and a lethal attack, which sees seven men from the Premier County represented in the selection. There is room for four Corkmen, two from Kilkenny and one each from Dublin and Galway. Tipperary's Jake Morris is considered the cream of the crop, the half-forward voted Player of the Year by the RTÉ GAA pundits. Rhys Shelly (Tipperary) Despite becoming the first goalkeeper to score from play in an All-Ireland hurling final with his huge 69th-minute effort, the Moycarkey Borris man has made the grade on the strength of his restarts and his defensive solidity. Conceded eight goals in his first three Championship matches after taking the number one jersey from Barry Hogan, but after that conceded just four in Tipp's remaining four Championship matches (thanks to a penalty save late in the final). Not only were his puckouts long and accurate, he was also adept at getting them away very quickly. Robert Doyle (Tipperary) A wonderful debut inter-county season is made all the more remarkable by the fact the Clonoulty-Rossmore man plays corner-forward for his club. That might explain his attacking tendencies, notching a point and a free from right corner-back in an All-Ireland final. His place on this selection was earned thanks to some remarkable man-marking gigs during the year. Dessie Hutchinson, Eoin Cody and Tony Kelly had already been guarded by Doyle before he picked up Alan Connolly earlier today and held the towering Blackrock man to a single point. Huw Lawlor (Kilkenny) The gold standard in terms of inter-county full-backs for a few years now. Following in the proud tradition of no nonsense number threes in stripey jerseys, Brian Cody, Noel Hickey and JJ Delaney would be proud of the O'Loughlin Gaels man's commitment to keeping the game as simple as possible. Low or high, win your ball, secure possession and give it to someone in a better position. Not opposed to the odd jaunt up the field and has been known to raise a white flag or two in his time. Sean O'Donoghue (Cork) Jason Forde's 0-02 tally was by a distance the lowest of Tipp's rampant inside line today and that was thanks to the efforts of the ultra-aggressive O'Donoghue. The former captain from Inniscarra is as honest as they come and holding Aaron Gillane to two points in a Munster final is some going. Eoghan Connolly (Tipperary) Notched his obligatory point from a different timezone against Cork. The Cashel King Cormacs 'full-back' has been a revelation from long distance, both from placed balls and open play, this year, scoring 0-14 in total. Tougher than normal outing from a defensive point of view in the first half as his man Diarmuid Healy scored 0-03 but Connolly, like most of his team-mates, got on top in the second half and Healy made way for Damien Cahalane after the sending off of Eoin Downey. Ronan Maher (Tipperary) What can be said about the towering Thurles Sarsfields man? Goes one better than his revered older brother Pádraic by captaining Tipperary to an All-Ireland title. His peerless ability in the air saw him given the task of shackling Cork's talisman Brian Hayes and he carried out his duty with his usual energy and physicality. With Liam Cahill blooding plenty of young players this year, the experienced Maher was one of the foundation stones around which this Tipp team were built. Ciarán Joyce (Cork) One of Pat Ryan's former Under-20 charges, the Castlemartyr man has now played in and lost two All-Ireland finals at the age of 23. No shame in his performance today however, keeping Tipperary's main man Jake Morris to two points. One-third of Cork's massively influential half-back line, you feel his best is yet to come. Darragh Fitzgibbon (Cork) The modern midfielder that all modern midfielders will be modelled on. Athletic, blessed with boundless energy and ludicrously fast, the Charleville man is too good to have been on successive losing All-Ireland final teams. A massive target for Cork puck-outs and a pest on opposition restarts. Cathal Mannion (Galway) This was a better year for Galway hurling than 2024 (that wouldn't be hard) but where would Micheal Donoghue's team be without Mannion? His 0-17 against Wexford in the Leinster SHC was the display of a hurler in the form of his life. He notched 0-11 of Galway's 1-20 as another Leinster final against Kilkenny came and went. Jake Morris (Tipperary) The Nenagh Éire Óg man has been the leader of Tipperary's lethal attack all year. Like his long-time underage team-mate Ormonde, he is fast and loves to elude opponents with his movement. Economical in possession, will be irked by fact his wides (three) outnumbered his points (two) against Cork... only joking, I'm sure he couldn't give a damn. Andrew Ormond (Tipperary) Pacey, hard-working and blessed with sublime wrists, the JK Brackens man has been one of the finds of the season (despite being around for a few years since winning an Under-20 All-Ireland in 2019). His two points in as many minutes at the start of the second half were vital in Tipp's bewilderment of Cork. One of several Tipp forwards who revels in turning over possession. Cian O’Sullivan (Dublin) In a bright year for Dublin hurling, no one shone brighter than the St Brigid's man. On the inter-county scene since 2018 he looks invigorated by the Niall Ó Ceallacháin project and the talented sharpshooter adds a touch of flair around the middle for a physical Dublin side. He was off the charts in the shock win over Limerick. Martin Keoghan (Kilkenny) 'Mossy' has become the totem around which Kilkenny's talented posse of forwards circulate. The Tullaroan man, after a few years of being part of the support cast, has started to rack up the numbers of a true Cats matinee idol. Managed six points in defeat as Kilkenny's season was ended by All-Ireland champions Tipperary at the penultimate stage. John McGrath (Tipperary) John McGrath scores a third goal for Tipperary. We may never have seen the likes of this.... 📺 https://t.co/ZfZ9mA9XTY 📱 https://t.co/1S2tbTA3PH 📻 https://t.co/2SRRKdgjzu pic.twitter.com/kNFBkiv2yT Noel's fourth All-Ireland medal owes much to the goalscoring prowess of his little brother who has been a man reborn this season. His two goals today bringing him to seven in the Championship in 2025. A wily, smart and skilled hurler. A joy to watch. Brian Hayes (Cork) A shoo-in for Hurler of the Year had the Rebels got the job done today, but still a season to remember for the towering St Finbarrs forward. Against Tipperary he managed a single point from play, bringing him to 5-09 in seven championship matches, but he is more than just a scorer - a playmaker, a free-winner and a bringer of chaos. The Cork attack will be built around him for years to come. ALL-IRELAND HURLING FINAL MAN OF THE MATCH Ronan Maher (Tipperary) The captain played a captain's role. Tipperary's 3-14 in the second half may grab the headlines, but what about the 0-02 recorded at the other end? The Tipperary defence, in that second half, were playing on a different level. And the tone for that ravenous, relentless performance was set by full-back Maher, who completely shut down Cork's main man Brian Hayes. Superb in the air, a hard-hitting tackler and pragmatic when he needs to be, the Thurles man makes defending an art form. SUNDAY GAME HURLER OF THE YEAR Jake Morris (Tipperary) "It was a sobering winter for us all [after] being knocked out of the championship early again. Lads had to go away and have a hard, long look in the mirror, really. It's a hard thing to do but it had to be done. "Pride was swallowed and really it was about coming back in and giving this one hell of a rattle. "We worked extremely hard as a group to give ourselves a chance of being in an All-Ireland final and it shows what you can do with a bit of hard work and determination." Jake Morris bore the brickbats of the Tipp hurling public in 2024 when things did not go well for the Premier County, so how sweet will it feel to be a two-time All-Ireland winner and be credited with being the key man for Liam Cahill's team's unlikely triumph? The Tipperary attack can be an irresistible force at its best and Morris is the man who makes it tick. His tactical awareness, his movement, his pace, his skills, his eye for a pass and his shooting ability from range, are all the qualities that make him Tipperary's main man.

Full Content:
The photographer who believes their education ended with their last workshop or tutorial is already obsolete. They just don't know it yet. In an industry where technological shifts can render entire skill sets worthless within months and where client expectations evolve faster than most professionals can adapt, the notion of "learning photography" as a one-time achievement has become not just naive, but a good way to kill your career. This harsh reality contradicts the romantic ideal many photographers hold about their craft. We often envision photography as a timeless art form where mastering composition, light, and storytelling creates a foundation of enduring value. While these fundamentals remain important, they represent merely the entry fee to professional relevance. The photographers thriving today are those who have embraced learning as their primary professional skill—not their secondary consideration. The accelerating pace of change in professional photography has created what amounts to a learning arms race. Those who fail to participate don't gradually fall behind; they experience sudden, catastrophic obsolescence. The wedding photographer who dismisses drone footage as a fad discovers many clients now expect aerial shots. The portrait photographer who considers smartphone cameras inferior watches as clients use phones for headshots. The commercial photographer who views AI as a distant threat finds their retouching workflows automated away by algorithms. This article examines why continuous learning has evolved from professional advantage to survival necessity and provides frameworks for building sustainable learning systems that can keep pace with industry evolution. Consider the transformation of low-light photography over the past decade. Professional cameras that produced unusable noise at ISO 3200 in 2014 now deliver clean images at ISO 25,600 and beyond. This advancement didn't simply improve image quality—it eliminated entire lighting setups, changed location requirements, and redefined client expectations for available-light photography. Autofocus systems have undergone similarly disruptive evolution. Eye-detection autofocus has transformed portrait and wedding photography by eliminating major technical barriers. The wedding photographer who built their reputation on consistently sharp focus during challenging ceremonies now competes with photographers who achieve the same results through computational assistance. Video capabilities represent perhaps the most dramatic technological disruption. Professional photographers who dismissed video as "not their domain" discovered that hybrid shooting became the industry standard almost overnight. Clients began expecting photographers to deliver both stills and motion content from single shoots, fundamentally altering project scope and pricing structures. The mirrorless revolution exemplifies how technological change creates cascading learning requirements. Beyond the obvious operational differences, mirrorless systems introduced entirely new capabilities like silent shooting modes, in-body image stabilization, and computational photography features. Photographers who delayed transitioning to mirrorless systems didn't just miss incremental improvements; they fell behind on features that became client expectations. Photography software development has accelerated to a pace that challenges even dedicated professionals' ability to maintain current knowledge. Adobe's transition to subscription-based Creative Cloud enabled rapid feature rollouts that arrive monthly rather than annually, creating a continuous learning requirement just to utilize existing tools effectively. Lightroom's AI-powered masking tools exemplify this challenge. The selection methods that photographers spent years mastering—careful brush work, precise luminosity masks, complex channel operations—became obsolete within single software updates. The photographer who built efficiency through manual masking techniques suddenly found AI selections completing the same work in seconds. Color grading has experienced similar disruption. Traditional color correction workflows based on curves and split-toning gave way to professional color grading tools that require entirely different conceptual frameworks. The photographer familiar with basic color adjustment now needs to understand color wheels and LUT applications to meet contemporary post-processing expectations. Digital delivery has evolved beyond simple JPEG files to encompass formats and platforms that require specialized knowledge. High-resolution displays demand understanding of color space management, viewing environment considerations, and output optimization techniques that didn't exist in the film era. Social media platforms have created format-specific requirements that change constantly. Facebook's algorithm preferences, Instagram's image display specifications, and TikTok's vertical video requirements each demand platform-specific optimization knowledge. The photographer who masters one platform's requirements faces immediate obsolescence when algorithm changes or new platforms emerge. Print delivery has simultaneously become more complex and more specialized. Wide-gamut displays, HDR monitors, and high-end printing technologies require color management expertise that extends far beyond basic calibration. The photographer who learned to "trust their monitor" now needs understanding of ICC profiles, soft proofing, gamut mapping, and more to deliver consistent results. Virtual and augmented reality applications represent emerging delivery formats that will likely become standard within the next decade, and their capture techniques require entirely new skill sets that combine traditional photography knowledge with 3D modeling and spatial computing concepts. Modern photography clients arrive with visual sophistication developed through constant exposure to professional imagery across digital platforms. This exposure has created expectations that extend far beyond simple technical competency to encompass aesthetic trends, storytelling approaches, and production values that evolve rapidly. Corporate clients now expect photographers to understand brand positioning, target demographic analysis, and marketing campaign integration. The commercial photographer who once focused purely on creating compelling images now needs fluency in brand strategy, customer journey mapping, and conversion optimization principles. Clients assume photographers understand how images function within broader marketing ecosystems, not as isolated creative deliverables. Real estate photography has transformed from simple room documentation to lifestyle marketing that requires understanding of target buyer psychology, staging principles, and virtual tour technologies. The photographer who learned to capture accurate room representations now needs skills in HDR processing, virtual staging, drone operations, and 3D modeling to meet market expectations. Social media platforms have fundamentally altered how clients discover, evaluate, and engage with photographers. This shift extends beyond marketing to influence aesthetic preferences, project scope, and delivery expectations in ways that require ongoing adaptation. The Instagram aesthetic has created demand for highly stylized, immediately recognizable imagery that favors dramatic processing over natural representation. Photographers who built careers on subtle, sophisticated work now compete with heavily stylized content that performs better on social platforms, regardless of technical or artistic merit. TikTok's influence has introduced motion-based thinking to traditionally still-image clients. Wedding clients request "TikTok moments," corporate clients want "behind-the-scenes content," and portrait clients expect "process videos" that document their photo sessions. These requests require video production skills, storytelling techniques, and platform-specific content creation knowledge. Real-time sharing expectations have compressed delivery timelines to hours rather than days or weeks. Clients expect preview images during shoots, same-day sneak peeks, and rapid turnaround on final deliverables that require streamlined workflows and efficient processing systems. The digital marketplace has created competing pressures for both faster delivery and higher quality that challenge traditional photography business models. Clients simultaneously demand immediate access to preview content and increasingly sophisticated final deliverables. Event photography now often operates under expectations for real-time gallery updates, social media sneak peeks, and next-day full gallery delivery. The event photographer who once had weeks to carefully process and deliver images now needs workflows that enable rapid processing without sacrificing quality standards. E-commerce photography faces particular pressure for volume and speed. Online retailers need hundreds of product images processed and delivered within tight timelines while maintaining pixel-perfect consistency across product lines. This demand requires automation skills, batch processing expertise, and quality control systems that ensure consistency at scale. Content marketing has created demand for regular, ongoing photography services rather than project-based work. Brands need fresh visual content weekly or daily, requiring photographers to develop sustainable production systems that can deliver consistent quality over extended periods. The photography industry has experienced significant consolidation that concentrates market power among fewer, larger players while simultaneously lowering barriers to entry for individual practitioners. This paradox creates complex competitive dynamics that require strategic adaptation. The photographer who once relied on stock licensing for steady income now competes with AI-generated imagery and subscription-based stock services that offer unlimited downloads at prices that undercut traditional licensing models. Wedding photography has seen the emergence of large-scale companies that standardize services, pricing, and delivery while promising consistent quality across multiple markets. These companies compete with individual photographers by offering reduced client risk, standardized packages, and corporate reliability that appeals to certain client segments. Professional photography now faces competition from sources that didn't exist a decade ago, requiring traditional photographers to differentiate their services in increasingly sophisticated ways. Smartphone photography has reached quality levels that satisfy many clients' basic documentation needs. Corporate headshots, social media content, and casual event photography can now be executed with phone cameras and basic editing apps, eliminating the technical barriers that once protected professional photographers from amateur competition. AI-generated imagery represents an emerging threat that will likely eliminate certain types of commercial photography entirely. Stock photography, basic product visualization, and conceptual illustration work can now be created algorithmically at costs and speeds that traditional photography cannot match. Content creators and influencers have developed photography skills that enable them to produce professional-quality imagery for their own needs, reducing demand for traditional commercial photography services while creating new opportunities for education and collaborative work. Market expansion and increased competition have created downward pricing pressures that force photographers to improve efficiency, expand service offerings, or accept reduced margins to maintain profitability. Global competition through remote work capabilities has exposed local photography markets to international pricing pressure. Clients can now access high-quality editing services, virtual assistance, and specialized skills from global talent pools that often undercut local pricing. Professional photography has a brutal history of rendering specialized skills completely worthless through technological advancement. Understanding which skills face obsolescence risk helps photographers prioritize learning investments more effectively. Film processing expertise represents the most obvious example of skill obsolescence. Photographers who spent decades mastering darkroom techniques found their specialized knowledge had no digital equivalent. Manual focusing skills became largely obsolete with advanced autofocus systems. Traditional color correction techniques using physical filters and film stocks have been replaced by digital color grading workflows that require entirely different conceptual frameworks. The photographer who mastered tungsten-balanced film with color correction filters needs completely different skills for digital color grading. Large format technical camera operations have become niche requirements as digital cameras achieve resolution and image quality that previously required view cameras. The commercial photographer who specializes in architectural photography using large format systems now needs digital capture skills for most projects. Professional knowledge in photography decays at different rates depending on its technological dependence and market relevance. Understanding these decay rates helps prioritize learning investments and skill maintenance efforts. Software-specific knowledge has the fastest decay rate, often becoming obsolete within months of major updates. Photoshop techniques, Lightroom workflows, and specialized software skills require constant updating to maintain relevance. Equipment-specific knowledge decays as manufacturers discontinue products and introduce new systems. The photographer who becomes expert with specific camera systems faces knowledge obsolescence when those systems become discontinued or superseded by fundamentally different technologies. Industry standard practices decay more slowly but still require regular updates. File delivery formats, color space standards, and workflow conventions evolve over years rather than months, but still require periodic learning updates to maintain professional relevance. Aesthetic trends and style preferences decay at variable rates depending on market segments. Wedding photography styles might remain popular for several years, while social media aesthetics can become outdated within months. The competitive disadvantage of obsolete skills extends beyond simple irrelevance to create active detriments in client relationships and market positioning. Photographers using outdated techniques often deliver results that clients perceive as inferior, even when technically proficient. The portrait photographer using traditional lighting setups might produce excellent images that clients reject because they don't match contemporary aesthetic preferences. Inefficient workflows create cost disadvantages that compound over time. The photographer who manually performs tasks that could be automated spends more time on each project, reducing profitability and limiting capacity for additional work. Outdated delivery methods can eliminate photographers from consideration entirely. Clients who expect online galleries, digital downloads, and mobile-optimized viewing won't work with photographers using traditional print-based delivery systems, regardless of image quality. Communication barriers emerge when photographers can't discuss contemporary techniques, trends, or technologies with clients who have educated themselves through online resources and social media exposure. Professional photographers can choose between anticipatory learning that prepares for future changes and reactive learning that responds to current market demands. Each approach offers distinct advantages and risks that require strategic consideration. Anticipatory learning involves identifying emerging technologies, market trends, and client expectations before they become mainstream requirements. This approach enables photographers to establish competitive advantages by mastering new capabilities before competitors recognize their importance. Virtual reality photography represents an anticipatory learning opportunity. While VR applications remain relatively niche, photographers who develop 360-degree capture skills, spatial audio recording capabilities, and VR content creation workflows position themselves for possible future market expansion in immersive media. Drone photography exemplified successful anticipatory learning for photographers who recognized the potential before client demand matured. Early adopters who obtained licenses and developed aerial photography skills captured market opportunities as demand expanded. AI integration in photography workflows presents current anticipatory learning opportunities. Photographers who understand automated processing capabilities and AI-assisted editing tools will likely have competitive advantages as these technologies mature. Reactive learning responds to established market demands and proven client requirements. This approach reduces investment risk by focusing on validated market needs but sacrifices first-mover advantages and may result in commoditized competition. Social media content creation became a reactive learning necessity for most photographers after client demand was established. Photographers who delayed developing Instagram skills, TikTok content creation, and platform-specific optimization knowledge found themselves excluded from client opportunities. Video capabilities represent reactive learning for photographers who initially focused exclusively on still imagery. As hybrid shooting became the standard expectation, photographers needed to develop video skills to maintain competitive relevance. Professional learning requires significant investments of time and money that must be allocated strategically to maximize return on investment while maintaining current business operations. The 70-20-10 learning allocation model provides a framework for balancing current skill maintenance, incremental improvement, and experimental learning. Seventy percent of learning time focuses on refining current capabilities, twenty percent develops adjacent skills that complement existing expertise, and ten percent explores emerging technologies or completely new domains. Financial learning budgets should account for both direct costs, like courses and equipment, and indirect costs, including lost income during learning periods and opportunity costs of time allocation. Many photographers underestimate the total investment required for meaningful skill development. Time allocation strategies must balance intensive learning periods with gradual skill development. Some skills benefit from concentrated learning efforts that enable rapid competency development, while others require extended practice and gradual improvement over months or years. Sustainable learning requires systematic approaches that integrate continuous skill development into regular business operations rather than treating learning as separate from professional practice. Curated sources and expert recommendations enable efficient identification of valuable learning resources while avoiding information overload. Practice scheduling ensures regular application of new skills in low-risk environments before deploying them in client work. Personal projects, volunteer opportunities, and experimental shoots provide learning laboratories for testing new techniques and technologies. Modern photography careers require diversification strategies that reduce dependence on any single skill set, client type, or market segment while enabling strategic responses to industry changes. Consider developing complementary capabilities that appeal to existing clients while opening new market opportunities. The wedding photographer who adds engagement sessions, family portraits, and branding photography creates multiple revenue streams that share similar skill requirements. Skill stacking involves combining photography expertise with complementary capabilities that create unique value propositions and competitive differentiation. Marketing and business development skills enable photographers to control their own client acquisition and brand development rather than depending on referrals or third-party marketing services. Understanding SEO, social media marketing, and client relationship management provides sustainable competitive advantages. Technology integration skills can help photographers leverage automation, AI tools, and workflow optimization to improve efficiency and quality while reducing operational costs. These capabilities become increasingly valuable as technology continues to advance. Creative direction and project management skills enable photographers to take on larger, more complex projects that command higher rates and provide greater client value. The photographer who can manage entire creative campaigns rather than just executing individual shoots has expanded market opportunities. Professional learning competes with income-generating activities for photographers' limited time, requiring strategic allocation decisions that balance immediate revenue needs with long-term career development. Daily learning habits integrate skill development into regular routines without requiring major schedule disruptions. Fifteen to thirty minutes of focused learning each day accumulates significant knowledge over time while remaining manageable within busy schedules. Weekly or monthly learning blocks provide concentrated time for more intensive skill development that requires sustained focus. Three to four hour learning sessions enable meaningful progress on complex topics like new software mastery or technical skill development. Seasonal learning intensives take advantage of slower business periods to pursue major skill development projects. Wedding photographers might use winter months for extensive education, while commercial photographers might leverage holiday periods for learning investments. These concentrated learning periods require careful financial planning but can accelerate career development dramatically. Learning investments require both direct financial outlays and opportunity cost considerations that must be planned and budgeted like other business expenses. Equipment learning costs include not only purchase prices but also the time required to master new tools effectively. Camera system changes might require lens replacements, software updates, and extensive practice time that collectively represent substantial investments. Education expenses encompass formal courses, workshops, and online training that provide structured learning experiences. These costs should be evaluated based on learning outcomes and career impact rather than simple expense minimization. Experimental project budgets enable risk-free learning through personal work that doesn't depend on client satisfaction or immediate revenue generation. These projects provide learning laboratories for testing new techniques and technologies. Lost opportunity costs during learning periods must be factored into learning investment calculations. Time spent learning represents income not earned from client work, making learning investments more expensive than direct costs alone. Learning investments should be evaluated using measurable outcomes that justify the time and money invested while guiding future learning decisions. Client acquisition improvements provide clear ROI measurements when new skills enable access to higher-paying clients or previously unavailable market segments. The commercial photographer who learns 3D rendering might command significantly higher rates for product visualization work. Efficiency improvements can be measured through reduced time requirements for similar work, enabling higher hourly rates or increased project capacity. Workflow automation skills that reduce editing time directly impact profitability. Rate increases enabled by new capabilities provide straightforward ROI calculations. The portrait photographer who develops high-end retouching skills might justify 50% rate increases that quickly recover learning investments. Market positioning improvements create long-term value that might be difficult to measure immediately but provide sustainable competitive advantages. Brand development through specialized skills creates client loyalty and referral opportunities that compound over time. The photographer who views learning as optional has fundamentally misunderstood the nature of modern professional practice. In an industry where technological change accelerates annually and client expectations evolve continuously, learning has become one of the primary professional skills that determines career success or failure. This reality challenges traditional notions of photographic mastery that emphasize one-time skill acquisition and artistic development. While creative vision and technical fundamentals remain important, they now serve as entry-level requirements rather than career-defining capabilities. The photographers who thrive in contemporary markets are those who have mastered the meta-skill of continuous adaptation. The choice facing every professional photographer is not whether to embrace continuous learning, but how to implement learning systems that enable sustainable adaptation to accelerating change. The photographers who develop these systems now will dominate markets in the coming decade. Those who delay will find themselves competing not for premium opportunities, but for survival in an industry that shows no mercy to the unprepared. The future belongs to photographers who have learned how to learn. Alex Cooke is a Cleveland-based photographer and meteorologist. He teaches music and enjoys time with horses and his rescue dogs. Thanks for another excellently thought out and written article! I agree wholeheartedly with what you have written here. I myself dislike learning how to use technology, so I just don't even try. And that has most certainly caused me to be left behind inasmuch as earning potential goes. When I look at all of the job postings on LinkedIn for photographers, I see that all of these things are required - familiarity with sundry software applications, the ability to use remotely triggered cameras, artificial lighting, drones, etc., etc., etc. It fries my brain just thinking about all of that stuff. There is honestly no way I could ever get any of those photographer jobs, even though I have been a prolific photographer for 18 years. Why? Because I am not willing to learn how to use technology. I am eager to learn more and more and more about my subjects - I mean I will often spend 4 to 6 hours online researching a new-to-me animal species that I want to find and photograph. Or I will spend days and days researching where to find certain species throughout remote areas of the US. This kind of learning fascinates me and I can not get enough of it! But nobody hiring photographers cares at all about those things. They only want people who are learning about technical things - gear and software. And if you aren't really up to speed with those things then you are NOT going to get a job as a photographer in a fast-paced office environment at a publisher or advertising agency or public relations firm. Tom, your passion for researching wildlife and locations is exactly the kind of specialized knowledge that creates lasting value! Subject matter expertise is incredibly valuable. Photographers like you who deeply understand their subjects often create the most compelling work. Your skills ARE a competitive advantage, even if they're not what's listed in job postings. That's a very frustrating thing to deal with. Wow, Alex ... thanks so much for thinking that what I do is valuable. It is the #1 passion in my life so your kind words mean a lot. Its easier to measure know-how in photography technical skills than the depth of your knowledge. Sometimes those who hire you do not even have the specialized knowledge that you have and that is the cruel reality in today's photography landscape. Excellent article and a lot to take in. The photography landscape has certainly become a complex and demanding endeavor. Perhaps that’s why so many of us remain hobbyists, specially the older we get. But I would add that a youthful attitude and really wanting to be part of an emerging generation of creatives is necessary. You're absolutely right about the youthful attitude being key. I think the willingness to embrace change and stay curious matters more than age itself. Some of the most adaptable photographers I know are older professionals who've maintained that mindset throughout their careers. The number one skill photographers need is business related skills. Anyone can learn new technologies and master all of the technical skills but if they have no ability to actually operate a business and sell themselves, no matter how great their photography is, that is why they will fail. Too many great photographers fail because they don't know how to market themselves and run as a business. Same goes for the video market too. People can get jobs using older camera gear and many jobs don't require the latest and greatest gear, product photography is one good example. Totally agree. Business acumen is often the deciding factor between success and failure. You can have all the latest technical skills but without the ability to market yourself and manage client relationships, it's all moot. You might very well be right, Alex, in your assessment of the skill sets necessary to function in the business world of photography. But, honestly, your article was about as depressing as anything I've read lately. By the time I got to "The Learning Investment Framework" I was ready to drive a stake through my head. Seriously though, I think everyone needs to examine themselves for what they are realistically capable of achieving. Staying totally current on everything from SEO to AI seems like it would be a Herculean task. My 30 year-old self might embrace the challenge. In fact, I was doing that when the Apple Macintosh computer, Pagemaker and Photoshop first arrived on the scene. My 70 year-old self currently has had enough of all the expectations which follow the next so-called improvement. There gets to be a point where we become totally obsessed with updates, and lose sight of the reason we fell in love with photography in the first place.... and it wasn't so that I could integrate my workflow with Creative Cloud systems and my work partner on the other side of the planet. True, there are companies which demand those skills, but as an independent artist delivering no more than a photographic print to a person who bought it, I can be about as antiquated as I want to be. Not a single customer has ever asked me if I had a calibrated monitor. My thought is to know yourself and what you are capable of, what you have a passion for, and find a place that fits; otherwise we're just turning into heartless machines, riddled with anxiety, and constantly fearful of being left behind. Life should be better than that, and I believe the art of seeing a picture from out of all the noise and clutter which surrounds us will always provide the fundamental basis for a photographer's joy and success. . I love your comment, Ed! The most important thing in life is to enjoy ourselves, and to do what we love doing, NOT to "stay relevant" or make money or expand our client list or market ourselves successfully. I can continue to enjoy the photography that I do without learning new skills and without adapting to new technologies. However ..... I must admit that I enjoy my images more now than I did a few years ago, thanks to me now using Topaz for sharpening and noise removal. And I will enjoy photography even more when I learn how to use mirrorless cameras and the automatic subject-detect autofocus capabilities. So there certainly is a place for learning new things and adopting new technologies. But we should learn new things so that we can enjoy photography more and derive more personal fulfillment from it, not so that we can make more money from it. . Don't let it get you down! Remember, I'm solely talking about finding business success in photography here. The beauty of it as a hobby is that you can do it however makes you happy. That being said, your perspective about finding your niche and serving it well is valuable wisdom. There's definitely room for photographers who excel at their craft without chasing every trend. The key is being intentional about which changes to embrace and which to ignore, which is something that comes with experience like yours. Great Article, However when do you realize that no matter how hard you learn technology, You will always be behind? I was a computer tech for 30yrs, It wasn't until I stopped trying to be master of all and just focused on being a great tech, that I realized you can chase knowledge, but will have no understanding. You have to figure out what you want to be a master craftsman of and do that. Over time it won't matter about the chase, because what you chase will now chase you! Just learn how to take the best photographs you can and the rest will come in alignment. People go to school all their lives, and never realize, that maybe if they had just focused on one thing, eventually they would became the master they wanted to be. Be true to yourself and you will learn more than anyone who spends wasted hrs, days and most of their lives trying to keep up with what everyone else says is the standard. When you are unique, having wisdom and understanding, People will see that and you won't ever become outdated. What a wonderfully uplifting and valuable perspective. While simply a schlub amatuer, I did spend 30 years in technology sales and responded to dozens if not hundreds of RFPs and frankly nearly all were boilerplate requirements that had nothing to do with the actual job or equipment needs. I strongly suspect that what you see in requests and Linkedin ads is similar boilerplate. You need to understand the project scope and the expected outcome, then tailor your response to that. If the do need some esoteric photo tech that you don't use, then pass, but most likely showing that you understand what they want and can demonstrate that you have done similar work, will most likely hand you the job. My companies succeeded because of three things, our reputation, the reputation of the products we represented and our relationship with the consultant and/or decision makers. Fantastic point. Many, many (many, many) job postings and the like really are just boilerplate, and it comes down to the ability to read between the lines. There's an interesting parallel with the printing industry. While digital equipment has taken the spotlight in the last decade or so, there's a niche printing business that uses old (sometimes 100 year-old or more) vintage letterpress equipment for producing small quantities of specialty print jobs such as wedding invitations and retail hang tags.... something with tactile benefits not found in high-speed offset or digital printing. If you're familiar with 19th century printing presses, you're aware of how labor intensive setting up a press with individual blocks of type was for those people tasked with the job. Back then they had no better way. Now people do it for the love of traditional methods, and there's a market for the products. "Made-By-Hand" is no exaggeration. While it may not be a script for everyone, there are businesses looking to the past rather than the future for their strategic plan. That's super interesting, and I think you're right. I've noticed a big uptick in businesses going that route as a way to distinguish themselves in the last decade or so. Terrific in-depth article!

Full Content:
At fault for Tipperary’s crucial first goal when mis-controlling a shot that was going over the crossbar. Should have been more decisive under a long ball for Tipp’s second goal. Rating: 4 On a lot of ball in the first half when Cork were mostly comfortable at the back. Scored and made a point on his forays into attack. Ultimately couldn’t handle Darragh McCarthy. Rating: 5 Coped reasonably well under the dropping ball in the first half but was losing his battle with John McGrath when he picked up a second yellow for conceding a penalty. Rating: 4 Tipp were happy for O’Donoghue to be the first receiver on short puck-outs and his distribution was patchy. His least impressive game of an otherwise excellent season. Rating: 5 Fought hard as usual and kept going to the end. Held Jake Morris to a couple of points from play without negating his influence. Morris must now be favourite for Hurler of the Year. Rating: 5 Absolutely commanding in the first half, dominating in the air and on the ground, but the centre didn’t hold in the second half when Tipp started playing the ball in front of him. Rating: 6 Made a blistering start, sweeping up around the Cork half-back line and starting attacks, but couldn’t maintain that influence and faded as the game wore on. Rating: 6 After a terrific season this was his least effective performance. Made an early assist and had a couple of score involvements late in the first half but otherwise offered little in attack. Rating: 4 Was the most influential of the four centre fielders in the first half, but Cork lost a grip in the middle third in the second half. Fought hard against the tide. Finished with three points from play. Rating: 6 For a young player starting just his third championship match he had a brilliant first half, scoring three points and assisting two. Couldn’t get going after half-time and was eventually replaced. Rating: 6 Superb in the opening half, rifling three points from play, including what seemed at the time like a vital goal in first-half stoppage time. Finished with 1-4 but couldn’t influence the second half. Rating: 7 Just like last year, he followed a terrific semi-final with an ineffective performance in the final. Landed a trademark long free in the first half, but faded badly before being replaced. Rating: 4 The most effective of Cork’s inside forwards in the first half, scoring one from play and making another. Missed a free just after half-time and was replaced before the hour mark. Rating: 5 Got his only point shortly before half-time but had struggled to get his hands on the ball before that. Ironically, fluffed the only goal chance he created by making a poor handpass instead of shooting. Rating: 4 Was smothered in the air by Ronan Maher. One of his flicks from a long puck-out resulted in a first half score, and was fouled for two frees, but was essentially neutralised by Tipp. Rating: 5 Seamus Harnedy was lively as always, hitting the crossbar with a rasping shot for goal and scoring a late point. Damien Cahalane coped well as an emergency full back, apart from one ridiculous foul for charging. Rating: 5 Cork coped well with Tipp’s extra defender in the first half but when the momentum of the game shifted violently after the break they didn’t have any solutions. Too many players failed.

Title: Tech spending remains persistently uncertain

UPDATED 11:55 EDT / JULY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante While the Nasdaq seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued market uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news, but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to over-rotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes that could potentially be achieved much more cost-effectively with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise information technology spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending, and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during era of the cloud, mobile, software-as-a-service, social and big data. Each wave is different, but two common themes remain: 1) strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2) fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision-making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. In this Breaking Analysis, we take a look at the quarterly spending data from Enterprise Technology Research and give you our take on what’s happening in the market at the macro and how the spending climate has changed. We’ll quantify the stubborn weight of uncertainty, both technological and policy-driven, and convey how enterprises are responding. Let’s start with a look at tech spending sentiment going back to the boom times in 2021. This data from ETR shows the quarterly expectations of annual IT spending growth from around 1,800 IT decision-makers. As we’ve discussed in the past, we’re well off the halcyon high single digits from the isolation economy. Calling your attention to 2025 in the above chart, we entered this year with ITDMs expecting a healthy 5.3% increase in annual spending, which declined to 3.4% this spring and has slightly upticked in the July 2025 survey to 3.6%, still well off the January highs. Of greater concern is that large spenders, reflected by the G2000 data, expect a 2.9% increase, with SMBs more optimistic at 4.5%. The reason for the concern is small and midsized firms are more susceptible to policy shifts such as tariffs, and their ability to shield the hit is lower than large global firms. It’s interesting to plot the change in tech spending against the two-year treasury as we show here. The blue line is the price of the two-year, which is basically inversely proportional to the tech spend sentiment. In 2022 we still had the exuberance hangover from COVID, and as interest rates spiked, tech spending expectations slowly waned (from roughly 7% to 6%). But as reality set in, you can see the July 2023 spending trajectory tanked to under 3% and has remained in the mid-3% range since. In addition to the factors we mentioned at the beginning, cyber risks have escalated along with all the geopolitical gymnastics, leading to this persistent caution that we’ve cited. An interesting data point from a previous ETR Macro Survey is shown here – gauging the degree to which geopolitical and other concerns have affected organizations’ posture toward operational resilience. We can look at this data as a large percentage of customers are making resilience a high priority. Are the ones on the right more exposed or are they more resilient already? We don’t know from this data other than it conveys resilience has become a top concern, which we’ve already known for quite some time. A main reason for this sentiment is with all the changes organizations are facing – geopolitical, the pace of AI, policy uncertainty and the like – cyber risks are cited by ITDMs as their No. 1 concern. And perhaps the most difficult to address. The urgency is shown below in this graphic from a recent study by theCUBE Research, led by Christophe Bertrand, quantifying the time it takes to recover from a cyberattack. The leftmost data asks 600 organizations to estimate how long it would take to recover from an attack and the rightmost chart asks those who actually experienced a cyberattack how long recovery took. On the right – those who have experienced an attack – only 2% can recover in a matter of hours and only 12% less than a day. The majority of respondents in both data sets face multiple days to recover. Christophe’s research quantifies the cost of such disruptions and there are many studies that do so as well. But the key points are: 1) the productivity hit of an attack is many days or weeks of lost productivity; and 2) organizations are beginning to understand the realities and are generally realistic about their capabilities. The other factor to call out is that budgets aren’t unlimited . In addition to keeping the lights on and running the business, organizations have to grow and transform the business. So they have to fund new line-of-business initiatives, fund AI and keep iterating on cyber. All of these factors weigh into the macro spending data we shared earlier. For those organizations feeling the budget pressures and decreasing spend, how are they doing that? The following data depicts the approaches used. On balance, only 20% of organizations in this study are reducing their IT spending. That’s down from 24% two years ago, which is a positive. And they’re doing it by cutting staff as you see on the left most set of bars. That approach is back to the highs of last fall. And you can see new projects getting delayed. While this is the second most common technique, it is declining in popularity. Further to the right, you can see reducing cloud expenses is picking up steam. Let’s dig into this a little more deeply and look at how organizations approach increasing their IT spending shown below. New project acceleration remains the top appraoch. Expansion of cloud resources, while still number two is in decline. So based on this and the previous data, you may surmise that the cloud is under pressure. The data below shows spending by category – Cloud, Hardware, Outsourcing and SaaS. Though the previous data could be interpreted as negative, the cloud still far outpaces the other broad areas shown, with 8.1% annual growth, more than double the macro average, and far above hardware, outsourcing and SaaS, which are all in the low or lower single digits. Remember, cloud revenue for just the big three hyperscalers plus Alibaba will surpass $250 billion this year, growing revenue in the mid 20s for the group – so still very strong and outpacing other sectors. Cloud is being propelled by AI, a strong base of existing workloads that continue to grow and a flywheel of ecosystem vendors the like of which doesn’t exist on-premises. Let’s close with a view on what the outcomes are that organizations are seeing from their AI spend. The vendor narrative at conferences is that we’ve exited the experimentation phase for AI and we’re entering deployment at scale. We don’t quite see it that way. Most customers continue to tell us that their AI is nascent and largely experimental, with uncertain return on investment. This in many ways is good news in that the potential for increased value is enormous – if you believe (as we do) that AI is a durable trend. The data above shows that AI is most typically being used to enhance productivity and augment mundane human tasks. Supporting better analytics is sort of a no-brainer. When you have good analytic data – for example in Snowflake or Databricks or a cloud warehouse/lakehouse – bringing AI into the mix makes a lot of sense, is less risky and represents low-hanging fruit. The third bar above – transformation with new revenue streams – will take more time in our view, but the net present values will be much larger than we’re seeing today with early AI experiments. The drop off to No. 4 is notable – headcount avoidance or reductions – but it’s real and tangible that AI will affect jobs. And surprisingly, or not, 10% still are really not going after AI in these stated areas. Our interpretation is they’re waiting for the pioneers to take the arrows. Let’s come back to the point on productivity. As we’ve shared in previous Breaking Analysis segments, there have really only been two sustained decade-long productivity booms since Word War II. The first was in the post-war era with a massive increase in manufacturing in the United States. This spurred a consumer buyer flywheel that drove productivity in the late ’50s into the ’60s. The second major uptick was due to the personal computer productivity boom in the 1990s. Many – us included – believe that we are on the cusp of another sustained period of productivity growth, globally. Let’s think about this for a moment. VC investments in AI were around $50 billion in 2023, more than doubled last year and are on pace to increase this year. The big three hyperscalers plus Meta Platforms will spend well north of $300 billion this year on capital spending. So let’s round way up and say $500 billion is being spent on AI, with – as we said – limited return on capital at the moment. Sounds like a lot, right? Half a trillion dollars for a marginal return? But let’s step back. The annual global economy is north of $100 trillion. People are talking about 10%, 20%, 30% improvements in productivity. Let’s take 10%, which by the way would be a massive positive to the economy. That’s a $10 trillion annual increase in productivity. So taken in that context, $500 billion maybe isn’t that outrageous and perhaps is even conservative. The question for you is should you dive in or wait? There are many examples of where fast followers have thrived in these new waves. Facebook wasn’t the first social media company. Dell wasn’t the first PC maker. Google wasn’t the first search engine. So over rotating on capital allocation early in a cycle can be dangerous. At the same time, not participating will almost certainly leave you behind. So our advice is: Those your organization will know where to deploy the agents. Your job as an executive is to provide the North Star direction, a foundation of a solid data strategy and the tools and resources so they can make it happen. We’re very excited about the future, as I’m sure you are too. The macro uncertainties are always there – even when things are booming, there are blind spots around every corner. So hopefully our data and your knowledge of the market can help you navigate the unknown. We’re looking forward to being on the journey with you.

Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The AI boom is more overhyped than the 1990s dot-com bubble, says top economist

The big picture: As tech giants pour more money into AI, some warn that a bubble may be forming. Drawing comparisons to the dot-com crash that wiped out trillions at the turn of the millennium, analysts caution that today's market has become too reliant on still-unproven AI investments. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, recently argued that the stock market currently overvalues a handful of tech giants – including Nvidia and Microsoft – even more than it overvalued early internet companies on the eve of the 2000 dot-com crash. The warning suggests history could soon repeat itself, with the buzzword "dot-com" replaced by "AI." In the late 1990s, numerous companies attracted venture capital in hopes of profiting from the internet's growing popularity, and the stock market vastly overvalued the sector before solid revenue could materialize. When returns failed to meet expectations, the bubble burst, wiping out countless startups. Slok says the stock market's expectations are even more unrealistic today, with 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios now exceeding the peak of the dot-com bubble.

Comparing S&P 500 ratios at five-year intervals from 1990 to 2025 clearly shows the dot-com spike in 2000. Similar spikes in 2020 and 2025 suggest the AI bubble may be even more pronounced. What's more concerning is that in each spike, the top 10 companies' ratios far exceed the rest of the index. Such disparity suggests investments in those firms – mostly tech giants heavily betting on AI – have detached from reality before their newest technology can generate real profits. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla account for most of the S&P 500's recent growth. Slok's warning echoes concerns from other industry leaders about the risks facing AI companies. Robin Li, CEO of Chinese internet giant Baidu, predicted that only about one percent of AI firms will survive if and when the bubble bursts. He said this will eventually lead to a more stable market with more realistic AI applications. Tech giants continue to make massive investments as AI's popularity grows, underscoring the high stakes in this rapidly evolving field. OpenAI is developing an AI-powered web browser to challenge Google Chrome's dominance. Meta is spending over $60 billion to build new AI data centers. Microsoft recently cut 9,000 jobs to offset costs from its new AI infrastructure, estimated at $80 billion. Amazon has unveiled plans for agentic AI, signaling that the race for AI leadership shows no signs of slowing.

Title: Sea of blue and gold floods Talbot Street as Tipperary fans honour Seán Treacy ahead of All-Ireland final

There were smiles, laughter and fists held high among the Tipperary supporters following the county’s All-Ireland hurling final in Dublin’s Croke Park on Sunday. Anthony Nagle, from Clonmel but now living in Dublin, said he had “not a single complaint left” following the definitive win by the Tipperary team. “Cork didn’t expect it. They are known to be a little bit arrogant. But their game didn’t turn up today,” he said. John O’Dwyer, a brother of Ryan O’Dwyer the former player for Tipperary and Dublin, said he was delighted. “Lots of heart” was his explanation for the Tipperary win. “The team had lots of heart.” Joe Bourke, enjoying a celebratory post-match drink in the noted Tipperary people’s pub Chaplin’s on Hawkins Street, said he put the Tipperary team’s performance down to the number of young people in the squad who had “energised the whole team”. However, the Cork supporters were not so cheerful, as might be expected. “Gutted” was the response from Togher man Gavin Barrett when The Irish Times stopped him on the street. He said he felt the initially successful performance by the Cork team had little substance to it. “I felt it was nothing. Then the second half – complete collapse.” Taylor Keating, who was with him, said she too felt the Cork performance was lacking. [ Cork v Tipperary live updates: Tipperary win All-Ireland after amazing second half performanceOpens in new window ] Dermot Crowley from Douglas said of course he was “disappointed”. He said he had not bought into the pre-match “talk” that Cork would win fairly easily. “I felt everyone was a little frightened of Tipp in the background.” Earlier, Dublin’s Talbot Street had been a sea of blue and gold on Sunday morning as Tipp fans gathered for the annual commemoration of War of Independence veteran Seán Treacy in advance of the final. Hundreds gathered at the memorial for the Soloheadbeg republican who was killed in a shoot-out with Crown forces in October 1920. [ Tipperary are better than they get credit for, but Cork go into All-Ireland final as the finished articleOpens in new window ] The sea of Tipp colours was not matched elsewhere, however, as from midday, the rest of the city teemed with one colour: red. John and Mark Swann from Doneraile were with a large group of Cork supporters outside Mulligan’s pub on Poolbeg Street, and said it was clear the Rebels had come to town. They travelled to Dublin on Saturday and were not going home until Monday. The father and son team and the wider group had no doubt whatsoever that Cork would prevail in the final. “Ten points. Cork will win by 10 points,” said Mark. Also relaxed about the supremacy of the Cork team were Donal Murphy, Freddie Sweeney, Ian O’Brien, Conor Curran, Jack Hannon, Steven Davern and Gary Sweeney, as they posed for photographs and enjoyed a prematch drink before walking to Croke Park. Some 50 yards away outside Chaplin’s bar, a group of supporters were equally happy, if not as confident. Jack Keating noted the county was on the “back foot” when it came to winning the All-Ireland. “We are so far back I don’t even know what is forward any more,” he joked. Around the corner on D’Olier Street and up O’Connell Street, the scale of the number of Cork fans became apparent as a tide of red swept along. By rough estimate, the crowds of Cork supporters outnumbered the Tipperary supporters by at least 20 to one. Tourists wheeling bags looked on as fans waited, five and six deep, at traffic lights. Street vendors selling “flags, hats and ponchos” mingled with those holding signs aloft calling for “tickets needed”. Music blared from Cassidy’s and the Belvedere hotels as the sea of red – with occasional dots of blue and gold – swept by to the beat of a bodhrán and chants of “Re-bels, Re-bels”. On the corner of North Circular Road, Shay and Chloe Butler were dressed in the blue and gold Tipperary colours but were downbeat about the county’s chances. Shay, originally from Gortnahoe and now living in Dublin, said Tipperary fans seemed to accept that their team faced a difficult task in beating Cork. “It is more exciting when Dublin are playing,” said Chloe, who added that she was “always a Dub”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That’s double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech.

Here's How All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there’s growth in electricity use and there’s a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it’s likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Update: Banks Beat

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Banks provided a strong start to the second quarter earnings season. During this busy earnings week, ... More the crucial technology companies begin to report, including Google's parent, Alphabet. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) The second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear this week. 110 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report, with more banks but also expanding to other industries. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Coca-Cola (KO), ServiceNow (NOW), United Rentals (URI), and Intel (INTC) As forecasted in last week’s earnings preview, the banks got the earnings season off to a strong start. According to FactSet, a robust 83% of S&P 500 companies are reporting earnings above the consensus estimates. S&P 500 Earnings Season Summary Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 5.6% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.3%, and for 2026, the expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary The S&P 500 rose modestly last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed. Market Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 should experience 14.1% year-over-year earnings growth for the quarter, compared to 3.4% for the other stocks in the S&P 500. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results this week, with Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) after the close on Wednesday. Tesla enters the week with low expectations, but Alphabet is expected to report robust earnings growth. The details for Alphabet will be necessary, as the stock has been held back by worries that artificial intelligence (AI) will disrupt their search business. While this disruption seems inevitable, the ability of Google to monetize AI-driven search will be crucial. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth Positive earnings surprises from the financial sector were the most significant contributor to the improved earnings picture. Better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Goldman Sachs (GS) were the most significant contributors last week, according to FactSet. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 4.4% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be further upside to sales growth. Better sales results in the financial and healthcare sectors were the most significant driver of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Sales Growth Estimates By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter in the previous year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. Goldman Sachs estimates that a 10% depreciation in the US dollar increases S&P 500 earnings per share by 2-3%. Furthermore, companies tend to have an easier time outperforming consensus sales growth estimates during periods of US dollar weakness. Notably, the technology sector has the highest international sales exposure of all the S&P 500 sectors. US Dollar Weakness Earnings should be the main event next week. There are some economic releases scheduled, but all are likely second-tier barring a considerable surprise. The better-than-expected retail sales report last Thursday provided more evidence that the US economy remains resilient despite the tariff increases, which drove the betting odds of a 2025 recession even lower. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession Despite noting that he is unlikely to fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell, President Trump continues to pressure him and refuses to rule out the possibility if fraud is involved. This conflict has the potential to add market volatility, with betting markets indicating a 21% chance of Powell’s removal. Betting Odds Of Fed Chair Powell's Removal News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will continue to be a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. The Financial Times reported that President Trump was considering tariffs of 15-20% on imports from the European Union, an increase from the current 10% baseline tariff.

At a minimum you would be talking about a team of chefs, groundskeepers, maintenance staff, serving staff, cleaners, etc. So I am thinking maybe a few dozen all told with some living on site. At least the interior is done in warm colours where some mansions featured on NC have interiors that can be at best described as tacky, cold and jolting to the eye. 1) It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live. 2) If I can pay $250M for such a mansion, why would on earth would I bother with a “non-functional helicopter” blocking the helipad, instead of a working one? 3) It is supposedly full of art — I could not find anything looking like it (but what do I know about the recent trends and tastes of the high gentry). The huge camera sculpture is supremely tacky. 4) A bowling alley? A screening room with seats that become beds?? A wall of candy??? 5) No books. Anywhere. 6) Why all the giant displays everywhere — including outside the house? 7) Why were the bathrooms not shown? All of it gives me a slight impression that it was generated by AI. “It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live.” Maybe somebody will buy it and make the most expensive Airbnb property. Cleaning fees or requirements could address Rev’s questions about the maintenance expenses. The most likely customers/clients could be young professionals doing their “micro-retirement”. Turns out a lot was unexplained here. The “non-functional helicopter” was a collectible from a TV show. The house was indeed listed for $250 million, maybe as a publicity stunt, but then sold for a mere $94 million (chump change by comparison) way back in 2019. It’s been noted here about the muted colors in movies now, with technical explanations about post-production predominating. But comparing automobile colors from the ’70’s to now, what was day-glo has become dark-green being a bold individualistic statement. There’s more shine, but not more saturation. A main axis of the World Values Survey is ‘survival / self-expression’. Is it consumer preference driving the wash-out? Or is it, you’ll eat what you’re served? Images of traffic jams in Brazil (a high self-expression country) look as washed-out as here, so that indicates the latter. A brief walkthrough of a Kardashian mansion I saw had no color, only glass and white, and no individual signification. No family pictures on the wall, just corporate art. Lifeless. With respect to cars, in my experience, the cars that are black or white are the least expensive. The red, blue or sparkly paint cars also have more expensive equipment packages. The sparkly paint is also more expensive to repair as I learned when someone bonked into my car with black sparkly paint as I was putting kids and groceries in the car and then drove off The last car I have had that wasn’t black or white was in high school when I got my mother’s tan jeep as a hand me down. It includes a car collection so that’s pretty cool I suppose. Probably none that should be driven in public of course. I get the bowling alley portion of the video clip, and I’m immediately reminded of the brutal and ultimate ending scene from what I call an epic film, There Will Be Blood. “I’m finished!” I’m most interested in the non functioning helicopter, and if I have to buy the rest of the mansion to get it, so be it. There Will Be Blood is based on Edward Doheny, a ruthless oil man. To make amends later in life he paid for the building of a large Catholic church on Figueroa St in LA, wags at the time called it ‘Doheny’s Fire Escape’ as it was pretty certain he was going to hell~ His mansion is now owned by something like the actor’s guild. I was there for a screening way back when. Then there is the story of his family yacht. Back in the 60’s I rubbed some shoulders with some nichiren shoshu crazies that cooked up a scheme to start a revolution in Mexico. For the first step (don’t ask me why) they hijacked the Doheny yacht. They were hunted down by the coast guard and prosecuted for piracy and attempted murder and half s dozen other crimes. Had to look… https://youtu.be/aKYCa56tDSw?si=nQI_VGx1N-3UmclP “I’m finished!” You must admit, he really didn’t have anything left to do after that. That’s why they’re called job creators Rev! Bring those Chinese kids in and save some money. It’s on the news. It was Clark Gable’s house. Beverly Hills. His widow refurbished it to sell it. This is on the news. re: US media How Public Media Lost The Federal Funding Battle, And What Happens Next To Stations, NPR And PBS https://deadline.com/2025/07/pbs-npr-funding-cut-explained-whats-next-1236461136/ Last time I looked every PBS program was preceded by a long list of oligarchs both living and dead who participated in its individual funding. Shouldn’t be too difficult to round up a few more to fill the funding gap. Look for the pinched reactionaries to next attack the NPR and PBS 501(c)3 status. What’s Ken Burns gonna do? I saw NPR manipulate a story to fit their agenda. They ignored facts and tried to inject uncertainty and doubt into an issue with which I was very familiar through work. That was years ago and they only got less objective and more obvious in their biases. Advice: Go to that permanent brunch and have another cocktail on their own nickel. Yesterday, while going to get our Muddy Fork croissants, the NPR man spoke of people who rode that plane, including Bill Clinton, who had ‘never been accused of any crimes.’ I’ve been used to the rhetorical twists. But to listen to him flat lie was the Timberlok in the coffin. Dan Schorr dies yet again. Stephen Colbert getting the axe. It’s unfortunate for the staff and apparently it was well staffed. I shed no tears, crocodile or other, for this individual. He turned into a political hack at best, far from his time at Comedy Central initially working for / with Stewart, then launching his own branded report show. Someone at that level and in a signficant role and time slot, well perhaps he and also the show writers, really could’ve done better than opening on a recurring “Two Minute hate speech” during the first Trump administration. Last year he did give a poignant, even heartfelt it seemed brief recap and memorial to country star Toby Keith. It started with an appearance by the Big Dog on the aforementioned CC show. Obviously the politics of these two entertainers varied quite much. And hey this proves the axiom, unless you own the company you can become expendable. Start a podcast…. everyone else has one. C’mon, man. Think of all the good things that Stephen Colbert has done that we can remember him by- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq76QSlRiPo (1:27 mins) I watched Colbert for a bit on Youtube back in 2016, when I followed American politics with interest. Soon came to the conclusion that it wasn’t for me. However, I did have a favourable impression of his immediate post-election performance. It had the air of someone talking shocked and anguished people off the ledge, which I do think is a good thing to do, even if the people in question and their tragedy are a little hard to take seriously. That said he also seemed to be the sort of entertainer who’s squarely oriented towards cheering up a particular political grouping, in his case the Democratic faithful, and not doing anything more interesting or complicated. Good for them (or perhaps bad now, but I doubt he’ll just disappear – he has talent for this specific thing he does). People like him are the part of the problem, doing brainwashing of the populace for the benefit of the “elite”, and hence the Guillotine Watch material. They deserve real axe. Staff too, because the “I was just following orders” talk works only in the minds of those saying it. I remember being astonished at public outlets going along with the dissing of Sanders, outright misleading of listeners, who went out and backed Clinton and Biden as ‘more electable’. How’s that working for ya, PBS? The high point of Colbert’s career IMO…His performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner 2006. He ultimately became the person he used to mock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-a2KeyCAY His brilliant best, relentlessly oblivious as his audience stopped laughing and viewers at home couldn’t stop. Turned out his advantage was playing a character, rather than being himself. I won’t miss him either but I’ll always miss his smug, glib blinkered alter ego. Re: How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Dream on. I have to admit that the first thought that popped into my mind in reading that headline was ‘How can cannibals stop being cannibals? By not eating people.’ Yeah, not going to happen. So, ‘How can Democrats win back working-class voters?’ By offering immediate material benefits to their lives. Also not going to happen. One concern I have is that Trump’s policies will make the status quo ante more appealing to voters. There are no cannibals in our village any more. We ate the last one yesterday. and then there’s this take-down of AOC by Caitlin Johnstone this morning – AOC is definitely honing her political chops and duplicity – https://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2025/07/20/aoc-is-a-genocidal-con-artist/ reached out to share the AZ billboard of tRump from yesterday’s links with an acquaintance – her first response to me was, “I haven’t forgiven you yet for this past election. I’m sorry, but that’s how I feel” my transgression was not voting for Ms Giggles – my mistake was sharing for whom i did vote – and it wasn’t tRump – for some there is no hope and no rational debate – my daughter told me to just forget about political conversations with folks – shaking my head, she may be correct – Fetterman in disguise? https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/03/30/cort-m30.html Never thought I would see the day where I was disappointed that AOC would vote against MTG. But here we are noticed in the MTG clip that she was disturbed by the fact that Israelis have Universal Healthcare and Subsidized College – would be interesting if she followed up on those too – does MTG not have an AIPAC handler? Re: AOC- I’m thinking AOC has dreams of becoming the future Nancy Pelosi with all the attached grift. So disappointing, along with Sanders. AOC’s concern that the Israelis need the money to buy more “defensive” weapons so they can protect themselves just helps Israel to fulfill the “Plan” to destroy Gaza and wage destruction across the Mideast. In the words of Mike Tyson ” Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face”. AOC’s “eat the rich” dress during the early stages of an ongoing Pandemic worn during a high end who’s who social event was by that point all anyone needed to know about how shallow and duplicitous she is. Leftists shouldn’t hate AOC less than the politicians to her right, they should hate her much more. It isn’t Mike Johnson’s responsibility to move the US government to the left, and it’s not Nancy Pelosi’s job. It’s hers. That’s what she was elected to do. That’s what she framed the goals of her entire political career as being. And she’s taking her stand firmly bracing against any leftward movement from America’s genocidal, warmongering, unjust, exploitative, tyrannical status quo. And this is why I particularly despise liberal Democrats. Republicans are at least honest about what they’re about. Democrats are “working tirelessly for a ceasefire” lol. Although when it comes to the Pandemic, an ongoing threat to the working class and humanity, most Leftists are missing in action as well. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. That is the Left as defined by the Right, and the “two” right-wing “parties” are in cahoots here: the right-wing left is very useful to the ruling caste, as the article posted by Jabura Basadai illustrates well. The Left that considers itself not to be liberal Democrats also abdicated any responsibility towards protecting the working class from an ongoing Pandemic. Find me any not-liberal-Democrat leftist blogger or podcaster that acknowledges the ongoing Pandemic. I’ll wait. UK reduces voting age to 16, aims to boost electoral participation – Scripps News Time for Semper to post the movie “Wild In The Streets”? :) Every satire and cautionary tale is becoming non-fiction/documentaries. If you become an adult at 16, then you can be enlisted and sent to fight and die at 16. Zelensky liked that. In the UK, you can sign the papers at 15 and join at 16! So your comment is sadly true enough. When people called for them to be aligned, they were thinking of the higher number…. At the same time, we are seeing the long infantilisation of the WEIRD adults. People do not form independent lives, households etc until 30+, instead living an extended adolescence through university. Indeed university itself is now being required to act in loco parentis of ostensible adults (there is a long and very sad campaign by parents of student suicides to force UK universities to do more bit the fundamental problem is 18 year olds are adults and if they want to fuck up, neither their parents nor an institution can or should babysit them; NB: this campaign is not about fixing negligent mental health care but about extending pastoral supervision). As a result, we should probably be *raising* the UK voting age to 25 or 30! What are the demographics for the 16 and under cohort in the UK? From the sad crime stories in big cities and economic distress everywhere, what are the risks of a surprising, non-Britishy result or two from the Council level on up the ladder? How soon will there be a Polymarket or similar betting pool on issues? Recently I’ve become of the opinion that voting age should be in fact raised to 40 to be honest. At 25 I was a veteran of three wars, two coup-de-tats, and several covert actions. I lacked educational experience but obtained my bachelors by 30. At 25, I had something to say based upon real-world experience, and believe me I would have said it if I could only articulate it well. All I had was my vote. Decades later I come across people far older than I– in their 60s, 70s, 80s– who have a child-like, simplified view of the world without the nuance and understanding that I had obtained by the age of 25, and you’re telling me that the voting age matters? Good point. Voters should be 25-65. We have had 16+ voting age in Scotland for about a decade, for the devolved Edinburgh but not Westminster government. I was fortunate enough to teach Modern Studies, aka Civics, at secondary level and even my cohort of 13 year olds were more thoughtful about voting than many adults. Age is not the most useful metric for being sensible enough to be trusted to vote. The youngsters all took their democratic privileges very seriously. Media disinformation and bias, plus the lying scum in the political class are the biggest drawback to sensible exercise of the vote, with 47 the porkiest pie teller I have ever encountered Re Did Trump Play a Role in Colbert–not only does the article not answer its own question but it also ignores the fact that Colbert was a government promoting outlet for his good friend Biden until last January. Additionally any broadcast outlet is by definition a government partner since their license grants them what was once a triopoly status and the ability to print money. That’s not nearly as true as it once was and for sure it was the Republicans who tossed the Fairness Doctrine. But one should certainly not judge the opportunist Colbert to be some kind of noble figure. For people like him it’s easy to be smug when you are preaching to the converted. Indeed your rice bowl depends on it. We do need the media to keep the elites honest but in that increasingly ownership restricted space there is little to keep them honest. One might even argue that’s the bigger problem. I read somewhere the show has been losing money for a long time. He was cancelled, not due to the losses of money, but because Trump wanted him gone. The same will happen to all the others that speak out against the Nazi regime. Losing money is just an excuse and not true. He should have never been canceled because he has the highest viewership of any of them, and is one of the greatest late night comedians ever. So I am told. Yea, and proof that propaganda works. From this side of the Atlantic, he seems as grindingly predictable in his gags and idées reçues as the “alternative” comedians were in the UK during the Thatcher years. Some of these were very funny and insightful people (Alexei Sayle) but not when they were on primetime. He is no loss. Amusingly, Trump seems to be the first President to generate the bent-out-of-shape media hatred that Thatcher did in the UK. She too was an arriviste vulgarian. So we can’t have an equal and opposite to Fox’s Hannity or so many other fox celebs beating the GOP drum? I don’t recall Colbert ever being successfully sued for falsehoods or various improprieties like Fox. I stopped watching Colbert when it got less satire and more cheer leading but as it is not fraudulent it should be taken as part of the political discourse however blinkered. I started to go down the rabbit hole to test the waters, primarily suits filed by X against channel this that and the other. Omg and SMH, it’s a list of law suits alright and likely one I can’t summarize well or with precision. I will likewise suggest, certain media channels proved their loyalty when they disquieted the notion of say for one example, the Hunter Biden laptop. Trump is a narcissist, this is a given. Fox news can spew a ton on information at the core audience and just on the other aisle, I’d argue that CNN or MSNBC have done and will continue as well. By the way, what is Don Lemon up to these days anyway? Oh, and Jake Tapper wrote a book to help assuage his hand in the ” Biden is mentally healthy and fully aware. “. Ugh, much of it requires a double take on most days. Other countries most likely have their news, the US has a large contingent of stenographers. Pick your favorite flavor of Kool Aid. And to add, the likes of a Sean Hannity, a Rachel Maddow, and until next May at least Stephen Colbert are paid quite well. My point is, as Mencken said, don’t underestimate the stupidity of the American electorate. So there are plenty supplying the koolaid. They are paid. Money is now speech. Just be glad there are still two major sides vying. When one side can shut down the other and instill loyalty oaths for law enforcement then we might be in trouble. Oh wait! I will concede you make a good counter point. We’re not yet at the level of say, Carnegie and his massive steel plants hiring Pinkerton’s to fire on the unruly mob of non union workers….not quite yet at any rate. To borrow a classic phrase generally attributed to financier Jay Gould, ” I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half…”. As someone else in comments often puts it, this timeline is lit. I agree, I shed no tears for Colbert himself. As soon as he hit the big time he was just another boot licker For the establisment elites. Quit watching him and the others a long time ago. Late night show comedians have not been funny or entertaining for years. A coupla years ago they had these American late night show comedians on late TV here in Oz as cheap fill. It was just garbage from end to end and I would rather watch an ancient rerun of Red Skelton and Jack Benny instead. At least they were funny. Benny Hill in 2028! Sure, he’s British and dead, but those things don’t seem to matter anymore in American politics. Absolutely Benny Hill and the only reason I did not mention him was because he was British. He was rude, crude, vulgar and sexist – and absolutely hilarious- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1FBqFOTLQ (4:34 mins) His life’s work reminds me of a tombstone I read about upon which the following words were carved- ‘R.I.P Here lies my Husband, he was Dishonest, erratic, Erotic, irresistable, Wanton, untrustworthy And a liar. Sadly missed by his Everloving wife.’ I had a feeling you and he got along. I’m a bit young to have followed him in real time, but I eventually caught up. Peace. Stephen Colbert was actually very, very funny in Strangers With Candy, a sitcom starring Amy Sedaris as a 40-something former addict and prostitute who returns to high school (Colbert plays a neurotic [and gay] teacher having a long running affair with a colleague). He did a great job as a “reporter” on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, way back when it was still funny, and invented a twisted conservative talk host persona for The Colbert Report – that show was likely the height of his talent expression. I still don’t understand what happened to his edge. There’s a clip of Amy Sedaris on The Late Show getting interviewed by him, both of them reminiscing about their débuts in the business, living in relative poverty, and you can see some of the real man revealed for a moment. And then it evaporates. Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner was when he peaked in my view. Actually making light of the sitting, war mongering, USA president (Bush II) and toady journalists, who were in attendance. Courageous stuff, given the potential for revenge from the targets of his humor. This version of Colbert may have simply been a product of his writers, and not evidence of a critical, independent, thinker one could respect. But one can be sure he banked a lot of coin in his career. I think it is not really such a wonder that a strongly Democratic-aligned comic would courageously assail some Republicans. Nor is it in any way incompatible with his career since then. Stewart was funny back in the day. Carolinian Colbert played a parody rightwinger on that show and later on his own Comedy Central show. Perhaps it’s an indication of his true lack of bite that the latter was surprisingly popular among conservatives. I’ve always thought his comedy was more pandering than satire but that’s just me. Lenny Bruce he is not. The pandering got worse when he made the big time at CBS. And to say he’s better than his lame late night competition is not much of a boost. The funniest thing from Jon Stewart is when he presented a medal to a Nazi at the Disney World. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFpHtufCIZ4 Re; People Are Becoming Obsessed with ChatGPT and Spiraling Into Severe Delusions “…Vasan agrees that OpenAI has a perverse incentive to keep users hooked on the product even if it’s actively destroying their lives.” “The incentive is to keep you online,” she said. The AI “is not thinking about what is best for you, what’s best for your well-being or longevity… It’s thinking ‘right now, how do I keep this person as engaged as possible?'” We’ve seen this before, and many of us here likely have experienced lost or ruined relationships in our lives because of it: Facebook’s ethical failures are not accidental; they are part of the business model Facebook’s stated mission is “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” But a deeper look at their business model suggests that it is far more profitable to drive us apart.

The process is an A/B testing group which measures how long the user stays at the site and there is only one measure anybody cares about and that is to keep them online.

As for The New Republic up in Links, Max Blumenthal on a podcast asked why the Dems hadn’t used Epstein against Trump long before and that’s an interesting question. I probably follow the news more than your average MAGA but didn’t know that Trump and Epstein were15 year bosom buddies. This weekend’s NYT story even cites an incident where Epstein brought one of his girls up to Trump Tower for a visit. It’s impossible that Trump didn’t know what was going on and suspicions that he participated need only the slightest verification. Hubris meets nemesis. On the plus side Mrs. Vance will make a nice first lady. Sooner than we think? Well Max Blumenthal should know that the reason why the Dems could never use Epstein against Trump and the Repubs as doing so would burn a lot of their own donors. And it would certainly drag down Bill Clinton as he used to take flights on the Lolita Express which would also mean that Hillary Clinton would get dragged down as well. In wrecking the Repubs, the Dems would wreck themselves so we have a MAD situation here. Dems are as involved with Epstein, etc as the RINOs. When does US stop suffering pedophiles? How do we become a sane nation? When do we insist our weapons not be used for genocide? Probably, at least 10 or 20 years after we stop rewarding calculating, ruthless, back-stabing, greed driven psychopaths to promotions on the ladder towards CEO. We bemoan the ethical and wisdom lapses up at the top of the pyramid, and ignore that the entire base of the pyramid is infested by equally poor barely human specimens. The rot goes all the way down. It’s as if the proverbial small town used car salesman or crooked sheriff broke out of their niche and infected the rest of the population. Time for society to have a hard look in the mirror. This is what ‘we’ want, apparently, since it’s what ‘we’ reward. Thank you for writing this, cfraenkel. In my opinion, the role of the US population in US decline warrants far more discussion. I believe the US population is not just a passive victim, but in many cases an active participant, e.g. by continuing to refuse to hold the people that have been wrecking the country for decades now accountable in any meaningful way. At the very least, more people could stop legitimizing the current system by refusing to vote, but even that is apparently too much to ask. So we get the “leaders” we deserve, I guess. Leaders in Washington and State capitals who ignore their constituents and grovel for money by selling their souls to high bidders, and the occasional blackmailer! Make the processes transparent and auditable. Maybe one of the brewing scandals will help clean out Washington for a new crew. In my opinion, that’s wishful thinking at this point. I suggest we use our power over our own actions to withhold our consent to be governed. Votes can still be manufactured of course, but at least our conscience will be clean. Re: Human Programmer beats OpenAI (op cit) Gimme a break. Tom’s Hardware doesn’t give details about the challenge’s challenges, but it seems I first encountered this kind of problem (“dynamic programming”) back ca. 1980, matching speech signals to targets, and it was already an old problem, a variant of the “traveling salesman problem” in which a self-driving car has to cross Manhattan.

The idea seems to be to make those kids self sufficient from an early age and develop their hand-eye coordination. It’s almost a meme how guys right out of high school have no idea about cooking and will just go for Door Dash instead or get their moms to make them something. Of course the comments for that video clip are mixed and some are really experiencing sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/gunsnrosesgirl3/status/1935044059506295111 In USA they skip the manufacturing, and sent kids directly to sales and other services. Seems like a Chinese reinvention of Montessori…my kids did a lot of similar stuff, though definitely not at such a high throughput rate! I immediately thought the same thing: Montessori school with Chinese characteristics. Which is definitely cool. I’m sure there are reasons (maybe some cynical), but I’ve never understood why no country has ever tried just mainlining Montessori education into most of their schools. Hope there is a good Emergency Room nearby. Wonder how liability law works in China? I became a “latch-key kid” around that age, long before ambulance-chasers and St. Reagan’s intrusive nanny-state/authoritarian police state started sucking the life out of… well, pretty much everything. We’ve become a society of pussies where any risk is unacceptable to many– even calculated ones: pain, real pain, can be a valuable teacher, and I’m not talking about hurt feelings here (although those can have value too). Those kids are starting much earlier in life than ours, learning self-suffiency and skills necessary for “adulting,” things that many of our man-childs and 40-50 y.o. “girls” have never, and won’t ever, learn. I am impressed by what I see in the video, and am saddened by what I see being done to our youth as they are encouraged to distance themselves even further from life’s realities than even their parents likely are.

The Verge Acceleration is not only about power-to-weight ratio, but also rubber meeting the road. In addition to that, going fast is not only about accelerating, but also slowing down. Small wheels (and small brakes) are inherently bad at that, because they are small. A team of ex-Formula One engineers knows that, which means they are just talking the talk for publicity. Also, the smaller the diameter of the wheel the higher the rpm, so going fast on these would probably require Formula One level maintenece.

Just out of curiosity, are there many people here with enough money to spare that they need to find something to do with it, who don’t invest in something unethical? Starting a new job, and at a stage where the basics in life are sorted, and have the nice problem of not knowing what I will do with the money (which of course I will need to in-part use for retirement some day) – but after years of reading NC and the ills of ‘money making money’ in general etc. – am kind of paralyzed as to what to actually do with it, which isn’t going to be investing in something unethical one way or the other. So am curious if there are people who have successfully navigated this, and are doing well, without selling their soul and ‘buying in’ to one variety of evil or other, with their investments. Whether it is actually practically doable. I’m becoming more convinced that this is one of the ways – maybe even one of the primary ways – that economic conservatives and exploitative capitalists, achieve ‘buy in’ and votes among so much of the population: Corrupting their ethics/morals, through gains from unethical investments (that many people are not even initially aware they are investing in, e.g. hidden/obscured in pension portfolio company lists). Plenty of people turned off by the financial markets have sought to invest money in real estate; local rentals, AirBnBs, or flips, or land speculation. Which, perversely, has turned questionably ethical over the last 20 years, because these little real estate empires, along with the corporate ones, have jacked up prices and rents, and made affordable housing scarcer. Yet if you don’t want to invest in stocks and bonds, it would still certainly be wise to secure paid-off housing in an area you won’t mind living in if society ever goes seriously off the rails. I have long held a certain interest in local or state run credit unions, many of which have a local or regional tie to a former corporation or industry affiliation. Many of these succeeded as a basic truly co-operative, the largest are known by their TV ads or a sponsorship of a local arena perhaps. Navy Federal is a real big one. But as I’ve found before you just need to check around for one that suits your needs for competitive money market rates or even CD offerings. Making a key assumption here, this is a US focused inquiry. One minor note, free advice is often worth the price (!) In addition to local credit unions, there is a new category of socially and/or environmentally oriented financial service companies that are certified by the federal government if they invest primarily in local low-income markets. There are 1500 of them that specialize in lending to entities the banks either can not or choose not to reach….due to lower loan size or somewhat greater risk. The field is attracted talent and you can lend to them or deposit (if they are regulated. Most are non profit but some are small banks or credit unions. Meant to say, they are called “Community Development Financial Institutions” or CDFIs. There are project-specific municipal bonds. You’d be basically lending a city money for a project which you’d be able to get information about, at interest. If you don’t want to pay police salaries, for example, you could buy bonds for a park project. They have the added benefit of being one of the safer places to keep your money; cities rarely default. I’m glad you bring this up. The old standby, ‘no ethical consumption under capitalism’ comes to mind, though here we’re talking investing, not consumption. My own thinking for small-time retail investors is similar to my thinking on boycotts: individual choice in the market is not how social change happens, and the ownership of the stock market is so highly concentrated that the little guys making money adding their small savings to finance ugly business makes little difference, except in that it makes life easier for them. Interesting theory about the compromises we make for more money inculcating cynical, self-serving and immoral behavior. I wish you well, and hope that if you find another route, you’ll share! – ‘The CIA Initiated an Intelligence and Terrorist War on Russia Based on a Lie’ – Larry Johnson I somehow missed the original article by Tim Weiner in Foreign Policy that is the subject of this piece. I had just read it this morning (it was linked at MofA) and saw Johnson’s rejoinder here. I’m not sure if it was linked in NC earlier, but everyone should read it. It is quite extraordinary for all the reasons Larry points out and more. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen such an unintentionally revealing article about an important subject (the CIA’s Russia House and its role in Ukraine) and also its author. If there were any doubts that Weiner is a complete “toady” for the CIA (to use Weiner’s own term), this article should dispel them. Unfortunately, because of all the despicable current actions by the Trump administration from Gaza to Ukraine to Epstein to DOGE to etc,.etc., it will be hard to take seriously any real “revelations” about Russiagate made by any of them. They will simply be seen as partisan rhetoric to deflect attention from Trump’s own evil actions (all of the sudden Gabbard has reappeared from oblivion to carry out this task for the MAGA faithful). And this will probably be correct. A curse on all their houses. Small ray of hope: Trump disses neo-con killapalooza: https://thehill.com/homenews/5410319-trump-administration-turns-hostile-on-aspen-security-forum/ LOL! Trump probably didn’t realize that he would be praised at the conference by Condi Rice for his recent “aggressive stance on Putin,” according to the article from The Hill posted above. A “bipartisan” conference of leading foreign policy elites. At the “Aspen Security Forum.” A panel “moderated by NBC’s Andrea Mitchell.” How could the Trump administration resist such an opportunity to share their views with the “foreign policy community”? >Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943 “Both [Poland and Ukraine] are modern European democracies that can handle an objective investigation of past atrocities in ways that a country like Russia unfortunately can not,” he said. Any article about Ukraine’s dark past must conclude with a condemnation of modern-day Russia. Ya gotta love how they take every possible opportunity to promote the bald-faced lie that Ukraine is a democracy, a modern, functional country. Before the SMO, it was “Europe’s most corrupt country” and “plagued by Neo-nazi nationalist movements”. Of course that’s all down the memory hole. Britain faces a test of identity: Will Britons become a minority in their homeland? – opinion Jerusalem Post https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-861437 The Jerusalem Post is concerned that young British Muslims are going on camps where some form of indoctrination apparently takes place. I remember going on a boy scout camp when I was 12 and we were fed tales of the Empire and the need to maintain our right control our our colonies as a Christian mission, forced to wear funny caps, scarves and toggles at all times, and listening to lots of Methodist guff around the campfire every evening. I buggered off home on the third day thumbing lifts all the way to my house and told my parents I had no intention of ever having anything to do with the scouts after that. I left the scouts and a couple of lads followed my lead because we saw the camp for what it was – a primer for the our right to defend the imperial system agin’ the dirty rat-fink commie coloureds in the colonies who wanted rid of our lovely Monarchy and Parliament. The Jews have their own indoctrination systems for young people which have had a much more serious negative impact on British, European and Amercan politics since the 1930s and which intensified after the war with the legitimisation of the settler colony. I find the idea that we will be outnumbered by Muslims in our own home less than likely purely on the basis of the demographics. I’m much more worried by the example set by Jewish and Christian Zionists in their wholehearted support for the Palestinian genocides than I am about Muslim girls’ fashion choices when camping, and the perspective that many Muslims and non-Muslims have on the political élite of the West given their open support for the deliberate murder and maiming of children who are inconveniently Palestinian by bombs, bullets and starvation – and it’s resulting power as a new iteration of the blood libel. The Zionists are attempting to extend their landholding by soaking it in the blood of the children they have sacrificed, and the blood they continue to sacrifice until they are stopped by military force as they continue to overreach, along with the Collective West by deploying the rundown Anglo-Saxon and European armouries. There was an interesting article featured in the links yesterday and one section really disturbed me. ” In response to a question in The Brothers Karamazov about whether Jews steal and kill Christian children at Easter, Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know”. That is quite the glib treatment of blood libel.” https://unherd.com/2025/07/why-gen-z-goes-mad-for-dostoyevsky/?us=1 On the contrary, it was a profound treatment of the extent of one’s knowledge and the nature of truth which gave me great pause and resulted in many discussions with my fellows when I was a nineteen year old student. “…Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know””. How can he know? What other answer can an honest man give? A convenient yes or no, expressing belief without authority, or “well I’m rather a bit of a sceptic about that, actually, old boy”, depending on the audience, or just speak the bare unvarnished truth. My reading and re-reading of Dostoevsky in many different translations over the years have merely reinforced my belief that the position taken by Alyosha is morally and intellectually correct. For the honest, it must always be the bare unvarnished truth – and that is something which seems to have got lost somewhere in my lifetime. I agree on that last part, and I think the author’s idea there was that one is supposed to always express the prescribed morally correct opinion on such things. Never mind that this prescribed morally correct opinion was not widely accepted at the time, and at any rate would indeed not have been honest (even moreso in the drastically different informational environment of 19th century Russia). Alyosha’s answer is not merely a morally correct one, but also a scientifically correct one–and one thst dovetails nicely with the Grand Inquisitor’s line (from the samd novel, obviously): all too often, we are too sure that everythingbwe think we know is “two times two,” just a matter of “mathematics” and selff evident truth. The situation is so bad in the West that even George Orwell fell into this mental trap. Something else was wrong with this Jerusalem Post article about the UK other then the jncongruity (seriously, Israeli commentary on UK social conditions? There’s no interest in Israel in Blighty’s crumbs. If they need a surveillance overflight from Cyprus, they can order it via Uncle Sam!) and that was the claim that Andrew Bridgend gave a speech in Parliament that 80% of thrle 250,000 rapes have been by Muslims. If he had said that, it would have been front-page news and I don’t remember it. Have I I just missed a memo? Does anybody else remember this? Or is this just more hasbara against muslims…? “Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943” Yeah, the Poles are not going to forget the Volyn massacre – nor should they. There are about 100,000 Poles buried in mass unmarked graves and the Poles want their remains exhumed. Needless to say the Ukrainians are not thrilled at this idea. Polish President Andrzej Duda got stuck into Zelensky about this massacre so of course Zelelnsky played dumb saying- ‘Andrzej, I’ve never heard of the murders, the killing of Poles in western Ukraine, in Volhynia. They didn’t teach us about it in school.’ https://www.rt.com/news/621319-zelensky-never-heard-nazi-crimes/ But the Poles will not let this go and it was only several years ago that they made a film about what happened back then- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0POxClxb8cM (1:00 min) Climate change as existential threat– However you want to define it, climate change constitutes a threat of catastrophe for humans and other life on Earth of almost inconceivable dimensions. Recent estimates for impacts on humans and their economy may not be existential, but they project a Mad Max world with billions of dead, billions more desperately seeking to migrate, drastic reductions in GDP far beyond that experienced in the Great Depression and unpredictable and deadly geopolitical and sociopolitical conflicts. Driving this disaster is a grotesque misallocation of wealth, income and consumption. Fifty per cent of carbon emissions are attributable to the world’s richest 10%. Moreover, in the USA, 50% of consumption comes from the richest 10%. This distorts the production of goods and services so that we have too little housing, health care, food and education for the poor, both in the Global North and Global South, and way too much in the way of affluent consumption like McMansions, SUVs, non-essential travel and boob jobs. Put succinctly, we’re burning up the planet to cater to the spoiled rich and affluent while billions go without basics worldwide. Thanks, capitalism. Economic anthropologist Jason Hickel and Australian Dylan Sullivan published a paper in World Development Perspectives last September that laid out a plan for change that would avoid a catastrophic breaching of Earth’s boundaries while eliminating global poverty: Strategies for development should not pursue capitalist growth and increased aggregate production as such, but should rather increase the specific forms of production that are necessary to improve capabilities and meet human needs at a high standard, while ensuring universal access to key goods and services through public provisioning and decommodification. At the same time, in high-income countries, less-necessary production should be scaled down to enable faster decarbonization and to help bring resource use back within planetary boundaries. With this approach, good lives can be achieved for all without requiring large increases in total global throughput and output. Provisioning decent living standards (DLS) for 8.5 billion people would require only 30% of current global resource and energy use, leaving a substantial surplus for additional consumption, public luxury, scientific advancement, and other social investments. No, it will not put a Ford Expedition in every McMansion garage nor a porterhouse on every grill, but it will meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for everyone (as adopted by Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics) as it solves our society-disrupting inequality. I encourage readers to check out Hickel’s and Sullivan’s paper while suspending questions of political feasibility. Does it seem plausible otherwise that the move toward eco-socialism could end the charge over the cliff while providing a decent life for everyone on the planet? Is there anything truly necessary or essential that would be lost? If the plan strikes you as reasonable, what, or more accurately who, blocks its adoption? i’m, of course, all for it. but literally everyone i know in real life would be absolutely terrified and/or enraged….the 100 year Mindf^ck about what socialism, etc actually is…or could be…has been very effective. True enough. But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them. One of the big problems is the array of forces that have expended great effort and huge sums of money aimed at planting just enough doubt in people’s minds to give them cover to roll with Business As Usual. The people behind that will have those billions who die on their karma. And before long, that sharp down slope is coming anyway. This just keeps the party going for 10% of the world’s population a little longer. “But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them.” But do they really care enough? Most I know bury their head in the sand, outright deny the issues, or brand them a liberal hoax. The “aware” parents are mainly focused on setting their kids up to be the fortunate ones who will have the resources to rise above the rabble in hard times. That said, even if they really do care enough I don’t know what they can really do about it. Are they gonna raise their kid to be a survivalist? Raise them in a eco commune? We all feel powerless to change anything systemic so why not raise kids to be successful capitalists so that they will hopefully be on top when the pyramid scheme of modern society collapses. Better odds that way. As was said above, our best hope is to somehow radically reform incentive structures but in a society where public grocery stores in NYC is branded a communist takeover, feeding the homeless can be a crime, and healthcare for sick children is controversial, I highly doubt we are capable of anything remotely resembling a system that rewards those who do work benefitting others. Even if we could we’d need to get people like Jamie Dimon to accept he is in fact not doing God’s work. A while back a younger friend asked me if I thought we could ever make the changes needed to become a better society. I said, “Sure. We’ve done it before. All it took was two world wars and a Great Depression for western society to make some positive lasting systemic changes.” Or, as the quote often misattributed to Churchill goes, “We always do the right thing after we’ve exhausted every other possibility.” “20-Million-Year-Old Rhino Fossil Rewrites Evolutionary History” Wouldn’t it be fascinating if they found the body of a frozen North American Indian in the permafrost from 30,000 years ago when the first of them were arriving in this empty double continent. Think about what could be revealed by an analysis if their teeth and what it would tell us of who these first people were. There were a few findings along those lines, eg the Kennewick Man. People took them and their implications badly and the inconvenient findings were literally buried with claims that they were inconclusive, using the laws originally created to prevent grave robbing of old Native American burial grounds. Yes, when fossil evidence goes against dogma, it takes a long time for it to be considered evenhandedly. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/jacques-cinq-mars-bluefish-caves-scientific-progress-180962410/ I see what you mean- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man re: WWII interview German blog NACHDENKSEITEN has a long interview with WWII historian Paul Chamberlain. If interested use google to translate (archive.is wouldn´t work today) Interview with Paul Chamberlin: The Second World War as a war of racist empires – on both sides Paul Thomas Chamberlin is a professor of history at Columbia University and a renowned expert on 20th century international history. His writing has appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post , among others . He is the author of the highly acclaimed book “The Cold War’s Killing Fields,” in which he reveals the bloody global dimension of the Cold War. In his new work, “Scorched Earth: A Global History of World War II,” Chamberlin takes a radically different look at the Second World War: not as a battle between good and evil, but as a brutal conflict between imperial powers – on all sides. He shows that the Allies and the Axis powers were often frighteningly similar in their colonial ideology, their war crimes, and their treatment of the civilian population. In this interview, he talks about repressed chapters of war history – and why the Second World War must be retold. The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 More like that’s a new idea for some European historians and students… I think the myth that WW2 was a moral crusade against fascism, rather than a struggle between self-interested states, is not going to die any time soon. After all, people have been refuting it since the event itself, and any serious examination of it would point towards a more critical view as well. (A more critical view that, it ought to go without saying, does not mean it would’ve been better or even just as bad if the Axis powers had won.) An even worse version I see from time to time (though notably always in English, not Russian) is that WW2 was fought to save the Jews from the Nazis – judged by that standard, though, it was not very successful. Not to mention that back during WW2 that was the line of the Nazis and their sympathisers (I remember Mosley writing to that effect, for example), not of their opponents. Pardon my cynicism, but it seems to me that a lot of people throughout the Western world and (with some tweaks) in the former USSR want to believe in the Good War in which the Good Guys beat the Bad Guys, without any ambiguities or complications. It is both genuinely reassuring to the people and very useful to the powers that be and their intellectual support, who keep finding new Hitlers to oppose. The Allies’ actions such as air bombings and ethnic cleansing are very useful in that regard too: if it was okay for Good Guys to do it then, it is this much harder to complain about them doing it to someone else now. I suppose it still does some good to keep restating it and providing further proof, even if the basic thesis here seems so obvious that its rejection must be rooted in psychological and political factors that aren’t susceptible to arguments or evidence. I think this linecof thinking goes back ultimately to the notion of so called “just war” itself, as that implies that there are some wars, if the cause is just enough, that you ought to be proud of. Since wars invariably turn “evil” in its conduct on all sides (atrocities against civilians, hypocrisy, etc), this gives justification to the excuses that these evils are justified because they were doing greater good, the other side deserved them, etc., feeding even more hypocrisy. It would be far more honest if we could just fess up that, no matter what, to war is to sin and to sin gravely, and that we should try to minimize the evil that we do nevertheless and hope that God, if there is one, will forgive us, with the recognition that such forgiveness is not guaranteed. The trouble with the modern Christianity, at least the way it has developed in the West, is that we have lost the idea of sinning, at least when it is we who sin. Instead, we think of ourselves as instruments of divine justice, and so doing, mistake ourselves for God. Excellent diagnosis. re: WWIII RU – Pascal Lottaz from Neutrality Studies interviews Dmitri Trenin. Martyanov used to not regard Trenin as a real expert in military affairs. Which he probably is not as far as real professionals are concerned. I already wrote that it is odd if one particular individual is always being inquired on a variety of highly special subjects when it comes to a certain larger power regarded as hotile. 35 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giN29jR7VRc I always thought that was funny because, iirc, Trenin was a GRU colonel and presumably, a graduate of the General Staff Academy, too. Martyanov is a bit too full of hinself more often than not. RE: Barack Obama Now Squarely in Russiagate Crosshairs Matt Taibbi I have no clue where this will go, but I’m guessing nowhere, like most other things I wish would actually go somewhere. These people don’t care about laws – they don’t apply to them. I would be nice to see St. Obama get what is due, but I won’t hold my breath. What will be interesting is the spin and lies. I have been gone so I have not talked to my PMC friends, but I’m guessing they won’t/don’t believe one bit of it. After all, Tulsi is a Russian asset according to Hillary and most of blue MAGA believe that. Russia is also controlling Trump so this is all lies and nothing could be true. They have too much invested in Russiagate and of course they can never admit they were wrong. But it would be nice, in this case, the Epstein case, or many other cases, these slimeballs would actually get what they deserved. But they won’t. They will continue to laugh in our face and get away with whatever they want. That’s one of the perks of being in the Big Club. I think it has already been decided by the highest court that Obama can’t be prosecuted for official acts but it is exciting to think that if associated persons can be prosecuted at this late date for said same then just maybe we can prosecute the war crimes of the Bush era. Arguably the bigger slimeballs than mere election meddlers. Agreed. Would love to see this heat brought upon the clan behind the biggest crimes of my lifetime. Can’t stand Obama and his “high priest of brunch” status but I’m old enough to remember Trump’s team of investigators who were going to expose the fake birth certificate. Not exactly a guy with a reputable track record on this and an odd one for Taibbi to be hitching his hopes to. https://www.civilbeat.org/2011/04/10184-trump-sends-birther-investigators-to-hawaii/ Christine Hunsicker, CEO of a Bankrupt Fashion Tech Startup, Charged for Alleged $300M Fraud Scheme -People Of course, I had to check to see if she had ever been a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum.

And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can.” How many hospitals for Uyghurs have the Chinese bombed? What is her opinion on using British taxpayers’ money to support Israel? When I read ” Sub-Saharan Africa can’t afford to eat on a carbon diet”, I noticed that the article carefully zero-mentioned legume and non-legume bio-fixaton of nitrogen and also carefully zero-mentioned other soil-borne bio-fixation of nitrogen. It very carefully only mentioned the straw-man technology of electrolysis to produce “green” nitrogen. Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer and others ( so few that they can all be individually named) are getting yields comparable to the Haber-Bosch inputters without Haber-Bosch nitrogen OR strawman “green” nitrogen. African agriculturists could study Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer if they want to and see whether such methods can be used in SSA agriculture to fix all the crop-growing nitrogen which SSA agriculture would need to keep SSA fed. +1 Even their discussion of urea carefully mentioned only manufactured sources. In today’s Clown World, why Putin should fear Britain’s next fighter jet. 🤡 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/19/britains-new-giant-jet-fighter-prepare-marathon-russia-raid/ If Nato ever ended up at war against Putin’s Russia, experts say this means the aircraft would take off from a British airfield, fly to Russia undetected, destroy hostile air defences and then fly all the way back again. What this article leaves out is that there would not be a Britain to return to for this Wunderwaffe if it somehow fulfilled its fantastical mission. The fact that such tripe gets published shows us that the mainstream media have nothing except pure contempt for the rubes who read them. At this stage, anyone still believing anything they tell us is an imbecile who needs minding. Given that the RAF Tempest is supposed to enter service in 2035, there may not be much of a Britain to even take off from by then. We’ll probably see a flying prototype of the Su-75 before a one for Tempest. Even if it looks like Rostec has frozen the Su-75 development for now – Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov did promise a flying prototype by the end of this year, but so far only crickets from Sukhoi. Perhaps the Brits will be using a design similar to this for those covert raids. H/T Chas Freeman, who mentioned this during his latest interview with Nima, which also featured Lawrence Wilkerson. When I see the things happening all around me in my own medical world, in other words, the frank incompetence that just was not present as recently as 10 years ago, I often wonder how things are going in other parts of the world and economy that are just as complicated as medicine. https://x.com/aviationbrk/status/1946596722496491582 It just happened yesterday. Accidents and issues like this in aviation seem to be happening at an extremely high rate compared to just a few years ago. I am not even sure this is a Boeing issue or a Delta maintenance issue? I am not even remotely expert to make that decision. But these kinds of things are seemingly happening at an alarming frequency. I honestly do not remember this level of accident happening just a few years ago. It seems to be happening weekly and that has been true for the past several years. I know in my world of medicine that this incompetence is actually happening. In aviation, is this type of thing becoming more common or is it that we are just seeing more of it because of iphone cameras and social media? I believe a major contributor to increased errors with airplanes, significant uptick in auto accidents, etc., is our old friend, SARS CoV 2 and The Long-Term Sequelae. ‘Gone from the charts (only because we stopped collecting data) but not from our hearts! Or brains . . . It might be the wonderful gift of private equity at work again: https://truthout.org/articles/as-us-airlines-outsource-plane-repairs-private-equity-is-moving-in/ That’s a 24 year old 767-400ER so it’s all about good maintenance. I had thought Delta was still doing it’s own maintenance: Delta TechOps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_TechOps But I think even the majors are having a hard time getting good experienced people to do the work. PE owned, or flying out of the country for heavy maintenance, let’s hope these do not become common practices. You would think our ruling elites would have figured out that off shoring, out sourcing is not always a smart thing to do by now, but greed seems to over rule all else with these people. Anybody who is anybody is flying private these days. The thrust of history now read out digitally. Compelling. Thank you! We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. If you follow airplanes and I do, there are many sites from around the world that keep track of issues that might require return to the airport. This is much more common than you think, while still being a small %. One issue with US carriers is that they have some of the oldest planes in the world. Older planes will have more issues as there is just more time on the airframe and engine. Yes they meet all the maintenance standards but well shit happens. It is definitely not a boeing issue, boeing doesn’t make engines. As to a delta issue, once the NTSB issues its report we will find out if it was a part failure, or maintenance issue or something else. For example we don’t know if this was a new or old engine, was it recently rebuilt or near needing overhaul, did it ingest a bird causing damage? Every single airliner issue is investigated and a conclusion arrived at. if it’s something new, then it might cause a new check or requirement for an updated check protocol. We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. This reminded me of Russians dashcam videos of accidents. Lots of those around, because there are lots of dashcams in Russia. Just to note, the synchronized dives were two sisters; Lia Yatzil Cueva Lobato Mia Zazil Cueva Lobato . . . and not the names shared in the tweet. Credit where due. They looked so remarkably similar that I wondered. I kinda thought that they looked like twins myself. I note that a piece from the “The Ecomodernist” is included in today’s links. Have a large load of salt handy before entering; this substack is just a rebranding of the old “Breakthrough Institute” which provided a platform for technocracy fanboys (Nordhaus et al.)

Opinions can vary! https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow Additionally, Islamic finance has its own rules, much-eroded by oil wealth and greed, but within Islam, interest is haram (there are ways around this), as is profiting from things like alcohol or pornography. There are some funds set up for the purpose of easing the consciences of Muslims, while providing them with passive income; you might look into those. How they deal with oil investing and the issues that faces us with, we’d have to check. But there’s another avenue to explore. Really, we’re dealing with our desire to gain without adding value by working. Poverty is probably purest (monks have long thought so), but everything costs money, and we can’t help others without standing on solid ground ourselves. How solid is solid enough? That’s personal preference, past a certain point. The other day, there was a piece hosted here by someone who had lived for years as a nomad. Others ‘need’ a certain quality in their food or shelter. Taking the extreme, if we were rapacious, and invested in everything ‘evil’ now, and it freed our comfortable retirements for volunteering our labor-time, would that justify having a portfolio of oil, weapons, tech, and drugs? No one wants their excess, if we have it, gnawed away by inflation. I really do look forward to hearing any thoughts you have on the subject. When we’re talking economic matters, it’s a shitty world, which we navigate but cannot, except in miniature, change. I’ve seen it said that the reason Trump is going after Brazil with tariffs is to put pressure on Lula, due to Bolsonaro’s ongoing Supreme Court case. Both are eyeball deep in the fundie evang crowd, discussed on NC years ago e.g. the actions of Bolsonaro’s mob in trying to keep power through violence. A new film on the Brazilian fundie Right has just become available via Netflix for those who subscribe. The director, Petra Costa, is interviewed here (go to 45:14). RE: 100 MPH Scooter: Where I live these scooters are being sold to unsuspecting users out of former rental company stock’s. Fortunately, these scooters are now categorized as transportation devices and regulated in the same category as ebikes: no riding on sidewalks; bike lane speed of 20 MPH; max electric motor power of 750 W; battery must conform to specific safety standards; rider/driver must follow existing vehicle code (citations start at $100 and increase in multiples—confiscation is allowed). The municipal code specifically disallows claims of poor infrastructure repair (potholes/crevices in roadway) for accident/damage. Ride at your Risk! The article about poor infrastructure in the US is interesting in that maintenance of infrastructure has puzzling qualities about it. A group of people get together and fund the construction of something that likely will outlast the builders. Their kids or grandkids then have to fix it or maintain it. They may have quite different interests or economics. Also, the technology used to build in the first place may be difficult to repair. I sometimes think that when something gets built it should be given an endowment. If you put a million dollars into a fund for a bridge then in 100 years that may become about a billion dollars and that would be enough to make substantial repairs if not replace it. The flaw in this idea is that if you set aside that much money in a public fund some grifter will come along and steal it. Something a little similar exists for certajn bridges in the UK. A college contemporary is a trustee of one of these foundations. Rochester (Kent) and Southwark (London) bridges also have them. The trustees were granted powers by Parliament like sui generis corporations, usually including the power of tolling. They also owned land, either adjacent or further away. And they had powers of investment. A well run bridge can cover its repair and maintenance costs and generate quite a surplus. Some of these foundations give out substantial charitable sums from their surplus. https://www.citybridgefoundation.org.uk/what-we-do/bridges https://rbt.org.uk re: the war on cash via German HINTERGRUND magazine The gradual abolition of cash The following text is an excerpt from the Spiegel bestseller “War on Cash” by Hakon von Holst.

Title: Inside the 'Gen Z stare' and why it's dividing generations

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Dell employees are not OK. Every year, the company conducts an engagement survey for its workers, called "Tell Dell." One metric of employee satisfaction has dropped by 50% in two years amid layoffs and its push to get workers back in the office. On the agenda today: But first: Unpacking the new generational debate. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Millennials gave us skinny jeans and avocado toast. Gen Z? They've mastered the stare. Yes, that stare — the blank, expressionless look from the younger generation that's been lighting up the internet lately. Is it real? A post-pandemic side effect? A silent cry for help? Or is it just how Gen Z vibes? At Business Insider, we dove headfirst into the phenomenon, decoding the psychology, exploring what it means for careers, and examining how it plays out in the workplace. What is it? As more of Gen Z enters the workforce, some millennials say younger workers greet customers and colleagues with wide eyes, blank expressions, and pregnant pauses. Most of the debate hinges on Gen Zers working customer service roles, like hostessing at restaurants or taking orders at coffee shops. While this could be a sign of workplace awkwardness or underdeveloped soft skills, others are pushing back and saying the trend's blame is misplaced. Is it real? Our resident Gen Zer Amanda Yen says, "It's ironic that millennials are diagnosing their Gen Z counterparts in much the same way boomers diagnosed and pathologized them. Millennials, are you sure you're not just becoming your parents?" The value of silence. BI's Katie Notopoulos, an older millennial, said if you're on the receiving end of the "Gen-Z stare," maybe you're the problem. "One thing I learned is that sometimes silence is the best way to handle a situation. In other words, you might say: Give 'em the 'Gen Z stare.' If someone keeps pushing, eventually you have to leave some silence hanging in the air — no more room for them to negotiate." Just don't get Katie started on how Gen Zers answer the phone! Is screen time to blame? Psychologists and generational experts are weighing in, saying the phenomenon could have more to do with natural growing pains on a first job. There are also factors unique to Gen Z's upbringing, including how the generation has grown up in front of screens. One professor told BI that it's naive to underestimate the impact that COVID-19 shutdowns and online learning could have had on young people's development. What do Gen Zers think? We asked several young people between the ages of 17 and 27 what they thought about the debate. A 21-year-old from Boston thinks the whole thing is overblown. A 20-year-old from the Bay Area said she sees it all the time. A 17-year-old heard from her parents that she had been inadvertently doing it. We asked our readers if they had experienced the "Gen Z stare." The results are in, and spoiler — a majority of you have! It's been six months since Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency slashed the federal workforce in an effort to "streamline the Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency." After months of being in limbo, a recent Supreme Court ruling allowed the stalled firings to proceed. In a series of conversations with BI, six former government employees spoke about their career shifts, what life is like outside government work, and more. "I'll always be known as that." Also read: The ability to return a purchased item has become a core part of the shopping experience. Retailers say consumers are taking advantage of returns — and a recent report from Appriss Retail and Deloitte found it's costing businesses $103 billion a year. Some consumers are committing outright fraud by shipping back empty boxes or claiming a package never arrived. Others are sending back items after months of use. The culprits are often everyday consumers, and they don't feel bad. A nation of retail fraudsters. Also read: Elite millennials like Dan Schweber are quitting corporate America in favor of search funds: the practice of buying and running small businesses, also known as "mini private equity." Plenty of these unglamorous small businesses — like carwashes, plumbing, or snowplowing — are owned by boomers looking to retire. That makes them prime for millennial MBAs like Schweber, who can, in some cases, turn them into multimillion-dollar companies. Here's how they do it. You've probably heard of the viral concert "kiss cam" video that appeared to show Astronomer CEO Andy Byron embracing the company's head of HR Kristin Cabot, then springing apart once they realize they're on camera. The reaction prompted Coldplay's Chris Martin to comment, "Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy." A potential office affair is good gossip, but BI's Katie Notopoulos thinks there's something more troubling here: the knee-jerk reaction to identify the people in the video. Why she regrets seeing that video. This week's quote: "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder." — A millennial who was paid to catch people secretly working multiple jobs but ended up joining them.

Title: Starbucks corporate workers protest the latest RTO mandate: 'This is the wrong direction. Please stop.'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-workers-protest-rto-mandate-company-culture-brian-niccol-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-20T10:27:01Z
Full Content:
Employees at Starbucks' corporate headquarters who are unhappy about CEO Brian Niccol's strict return-to-office mandate are making their displeasure known. On Friday, a flyer created by "Partners for the Preservation of Starbucks Culture, Mission, and Values" was taped inside an elevator at the corporate offices in Seattle. Featuring two photos of Niccol and a list of grievances, the flyer calls out Niccol's leadership, recent cost-cutting bonuses for executives, the RTO order, and broader changes in the work environment, a photo shows. "Getting 'Back to Starbucks' isn't just about comfy chairs. It's about our Culture, Values, Mission, and how we treat people and the environment," it reads. "This is the wrong direction. Please stop." It appeared several days after Niccol sent a firm message to the company's corporate workers on Monday: Come back to the office four days a week or leave. Some "people leaders" who manage teams had their remote status eliminated, requiring them to relocate to Seattle or Toronto. According to internal communications viewed by Business Insider, Starbucks offered voluntary buyout packages of between $20,000 and $100,000, depending on title, for those who would rather leave the company. Four Starbucks corporate employees told BI they were worried the strict return-to-office mandate contributed to an erosion of the company's "partner first" culture. A Starbucks spokesperson told BI the return-to-office mandate was about enhancing the company's culture, not further reducing head count. Starbucks formally laid off 1,100 corporate workers in February. "I think for those of us who have been around for a while, we see a culture shift happening in the organization where our public face doesn't necessarily match our private face anymore," one Starbucks veteran, who has worked for the company for nearly 20 years, told BI. The latest RTO notices surprised the corporate Starbucks workers who spoke with BI and prompted others to immediately begin looking for new roles and sharing their concerns on social media. "As Starbucks chooses to require all people-leaders to relocate to Seattle, I am placed in a position where I must consider exploring other opportunities and would appreciate your support," Kristina Lawson, a Starbucks program manager who has been with the company for more than 18 years, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. Lawson didn't respond to a request for comment. Corporate America is in the middle of a return-to-office showdown. BI has reported that major companies, from Amazon to Zoom, have implemented various RTO mandates. Each company's approach has been different, with some incentivizing employees to work in-office with perks such as raises, and others threatening to fire workers if they don't comply. BI's Aki Ito reported in May that some suspected strict RTO mandates were actually a way to get employees to quit — and they may be right, because voluntary resignations remove the company's need to pay severance or health insurance, resulting in a less expensive reduction in force than traditional layoffs. "We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together," Niccol said in a statement to BI. "We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster." Niccol's statement continued: "We're driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values. We know we're asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone." Niccol, who joined the company from Chipotle last September, has been leading the coffee giant through a "Back to Starbucks" revitalization initiative. He's attempting to reverse slumping sales, improve the customer experience, and address problems with its mobile ordering system and long wait times. A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Starbucks is offering top executives up to $6 million in stock bonuses if the company meets its cost-reduction goals by the end of fiscal 2027. One Starbucks employee in Seattle who has worked in corporate operations for the company for more than seven years told BI that several other anonymous flyers had been posted around the building with complaints about changes Niccol was promoting and that some employees had voiced concern in open Slack channels. While they won't be personally affected by the RTO order, the employee said they were worried about how the company would operate if some of the most passionate partners decide to leave. "There are some remote partners that have niche knowledge and skills that will leave massive Kool-Aid Man-sized holes in the wall if they decide to take the exit payment," the employee said.

Title: As Newsom Campaigns, California Has Highest Unemployment Rate in U.S.
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/07/20/as-newsom-campaigns-california-has-highest-unemployment-rate-in-u-s/
Time Published: 2025-07-20T09:36:12Z

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already started his 2028 presidential campaign — but his state has the highest unemployment rate in the United States. As Breitbart News reported earlier this month, Newsom left California in the midst of over a dozen wildfires to travel to rural South Carolina, testing the waters for a presidential run in the state Democrats have promoted to the first in the list of primary contests. However, while Newsom has led Democrats in criticizing President Donald Trump and other Republicans, his performance in office is a drag on his prospects. Last month, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation: California’s unemployment rate rose slightly, by 0.1 percentage point, to 5.4% in June, tying Nevada for the highest rate in the U.S., according to new federal data released Friday. The state lost a net 6,100 jobs, including 9,900 layoffs in business and professional services. Health care and government saw job gains, but other sectors all shrunk. … California’s May jobs gains were also revised downwards to a 11,700 increase, down 6,000 jobs compared to a preliminary estimate of 17,700. 5.4% is not historically high; it is below the 5.5% that economists once believed was the “Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment” (NAIRU), the lowest rate possible before inflation would begin to rise. Still, it points to the fact that the Golden State is underperforming relative to the rest of the country, which — even in deep-blue jurisdictions — has tended to avoid some of California’s more extreme left-wing policies.

Title: What Analysts Think of Intel Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-intel-stock-ahead-of-earnings-11775079
Time Published: 2025-07-20T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Intel is scheduled to report second-quarter results after Thursday's close, with analysts parked in neutral amid questions surrounding what's next for the chip maker's foundry. All 11 analysts covering Intel (INTC) tracked by Visible Alpha have "hold" ratings for the stock. Their consensus price target near $22 implies a slight pullback from Tuesday's intraday level just over $23. Intel's foundry division is a focus of investor attention. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan reportedly is considering a shift in the manufacturer's contract chipmaking business that could lead to Intel writing off hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars' worth of chipmaking technology as a loss. A change could move the division to change its manufacturing process in a bid to win big customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). UBS analysts said recently that the move "may represent the first step in a hard pivot away from foundry and towards the product business, which we think may prove strategically sound but operationally challenging." "We have indicated 'light' at the end of the tunnel, but it is a long tunnel and we remain on the sidelines," UBS said. UBS raised its price target to $25 from $21. Wedbush, meanwhile, maintained a price target of $19, while HSBC kept a target of $22. All three analysts have neutral ratings for Intel stock.Wall Street on average expects Intel to report quarterly revenue of $11.93 billion, down 7% year-over-year, and adjusted net income of $76.3 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with $83 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from the foundry division is expected to have fallen 7% to $3.98 billion. Intel has reportedly started laying off thousands of workers in Oregon as part of previously announced cuts under its restructuring plan. UPDATE—July 22, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Daily Tech News 20 July 2025 Top Story If you gaze long into an LLM, the LLM also gazes into you: Geoff Lewis is managing partner and co-founder of Bedrock Capital (no, you're thinking of Blackrock) and guided his firm to be an early investor in OpenAI. He used ChatGPT to help him in his work on a daily basis. He went stark raving mad. (Futurism) There is a website called the SCP Foundation that documents the work of a secretive organisation that finds, catalogues, and if possible imprisons various kinds of cosmic horror and more innocuous but equally strange entities. It's a work of collaborative fiction organised as a wiki, and has been running for more than 15 years. It's all online where tools like ChatGPT can scan it and incorporate it into their hallucinations, which is exactly what it fed to Geoff Lewis, providing the perfect reinforcement loop to drive him into psychosis. Which in a strange form of recursion, layering reality upon fiction, makes ChatGPT into precisely the kind of psychic terror that the SCP Foundation pretends to investigate. (Hat tip to commenter Blonde Morticia.) Tech News Are you looking to spend $900 on a replica of the Data General Dasher terminal keyboard from 1977, used as the basis for prop design in the Apple TV sci-fi series Severance? (Tom's Hardware) Nope, me neither. Are you looking to spend $1299 on a 32" 6K (6016x3384) monitor covering 98% of the DCI-P3 colour space? (Hot Hardware) If you are, the Asus ProArt PA32QCV is exactly that and costs exactly that much, or will do when it launches next month. It has two Thunderbolt 4 ports with 96W power delivery, DisplayPort, HDMI, two 2W speakers with a headphone jack, and a built-in USB hub with KVM support. It only offers a 60Hz refresh rate, so definitely more suitable to professional artists than competitive gamers. I want one. But since I run a triple-monitor setup, that could get kind of expensive. Speaking of expensive, TSMC has leased land in Central Taiwan Science Park to construct four new 1.4nm fabs. (Taipei Times) No numbers attached, but expect it to cost more than three 6K monitors. The company also plans to build eleven wafer manufacturing plants (creating silicon wafers to turn into chips) and four packaging facilities (where the bare slivers of silicon are packaged into the products that other companies package into the boards that still other companies package into consumer products). Intel is laying off 5500 employees in Oregon, California, and Arizona. (WCCFTech) Assuming these are new layoffs, this brings the total job losses at the company to over 20,000 in the past year. OEM laptop maker Sixunited has announced a burger with the lot. (Notebook Check) The company's new XN77-160M-CS - forgive them, this is not a retail brand - uses AMD's Strix Halo CPU, which has integrated graphics on par with Nvidia's laptop 4070 model, paired with up to 128GB of RAM. The RAM is soldered due to timing constraints of the 256-bit bus - Framework tried modular RAM on this processor but couldn't make it work reliably at the required speeds - but it does have two M.2 slots. Plus a 2560x1600 165Hz display covering 100% of sRGB, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two regular USB ports, wired Ethernet (though only gigabit), HDMI, what looks like a full-size SD card slot, a headphone jack, a barrel jack power connector, and the Four Essential Keys all in their rightful place. No pricing specified since this will be sold to other companies who will then market it to the public. Musical Interlude Disclaimer: Ask the children. The children have many dollars.

Get those skeeters both in the water and on the fly. And they don't bother humans. Posted by: RickZ at July 20, 2025 *** We used to have those in the patio of our French Quarter apartment when I was a kid, along with not a few mosquitoes. Mom called the dragonflies "mosquito hawks." People don't believe me when I say we used to have fireflies too. My brother and I would trap them in a Tang jar of an evening with holes poked in the lid, and watch them flick their lights on and off. Then we'd open the jar and let them go. Posted by: Wolfus Aurelius, Dreaming of Elsewhere at July 20, 2025 06:27 AM (omVj0) 47 So family and I went to a lovely art museum in New Castle, Delaware - called "Delaware Art Museum"" not overwhelmingly large and with a terrific collection of of beautiful Pre- Raphaelite painting. There was some modern arts and prints but I didn't see those, and some great illustrations by Howard Pyle. Unfortunately, there was the usual left wing bias in some of the commentary. There was a picture by Howard Pyle with a strong tall, man challenging a robber or criminal who was trying to assault or rob a woman. Because it's from the early 1900's we need to be told that the white man is seen as courageous and strong and the woman is in a subservient position. Oh, gee, because white men shouldn't be courageous and she should have whipped Led out her karate moves and defeated the robber. They got me on tape I'm sure saying that and rolling my eyes But I enjoyed it anyway and I liked that one of the pre-Raphaelites was a very devout Christian who had wanted to illustrate all of the scenes in the Bible. New Castle DEi has an old section Which dates from the late 1600s with lovely homes from the 1700's and 1800's with some cobblestone streets.

If the cam position sensor gets wet, it kills the vehicle until it is replaced. It is on the underside of the engine compartment and the enclosure that is supposed to keep it dry is very easy for a mechanic to get wrong. I was twice stranded on a rainy. One of these times was on an offramp from the 210 Freeway in Pasadena just in time for rush hour. I later did a search and found many forum entries discussing the problem, with several posters saying they always kept a spare as part of an emergency kit in the Explorer.

The American information space is not merely changing; it is undergoing a hostile takeover. It is a deliberate, coordinated campaign by a new class of oligarchs out of Silicon Valley that includes Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg acting in concert with a Trump-led authoritarian political project. Their goal is singular: to systematically dismantle the free press and rebuild it as a network of propaganda organs designed to protect and uphold the regime and the oligarchs. The gutting of The Washington Post is not a separate event from the algorithmic manipulation of X. The defunding of PBS is not disconnected from the weaponization of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These are interconnected fronts in a single, undeclared war on the very concept of an informed public. To understand the nature of this war you must turn to Hannah Arendt and her concept of “a fool’s freedom.”[1] The modern deprivation of rights comes not from the overt censorship of opinion, but from the construction of an ecosystem where that opinion is rendered impotent. It is the freedom to speak into the abyss. What good is the right to an opinion if that opinion can never gain traction, never reach a critical mass, and therefore never matter? The oligarchs’ total control over the means of distribution (the algorithms of Google, Tiktok, Meta, and X) is the silent, brutally effective mechanism for enforcing this new, more insidious form of authoritarianism. The first front in this war is the capture and neutering of the legacy press from within. The billionaire owners of media, acting more as a political ideologue than a business custodian, have seized direct control of the nation’s most storied newsrooms. The narrative of financial necessity has become the perfect camouflage for an ideological purge. The language of “reinvention” and “transformation” is a smokescreen, obscuring a systematic effort to install loyalists, enforce regime-friendly editorial lines, and drive out any journalist who dares to uphold the quaint notion of holding power to account. This is a coordinated purge executed by a new class of authoritarian oligarchs who see a free press not as a pillar of democracy, but as an obstacle to their regime. The Press Has Been Systematically Dismantled by the Highest Bidder The Washington Post’s famous slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” now reads like a grim epitaph carved on its own tombstone. Democracy died and Jeff Bezos helped take it out back to shoot it and bury it for good measure. When Jeff Bezos bought the paper, many in the media hoped for a savior. Instead, it got an executioner and undertaker. The veneer of benevolent, hands-off ownership fell away as the prospect of a second Trump administration loomed, and the Amazon kingpin began his work: systematically gutting the institution and bending it to his will. The purge that followed was brutal. Under the watch of CEO Will Lewis, a political hatchet man brought over from the Murdoch empire, a wave of talent was driven out. Veterans with decades of experience were shown the door. A Pulitzer-winning cartoonist was silenced for satirizing the new power structure. Those who weren't fired were encouraged to take buyouts, fleeing a newsroom consumed by a crisis of purpose. What remains is a hollowed-out shell, a once-great institution forced into dutiful submission. On the West Coast, the same playbook is running its course at the Los Angeles Times. Billionaire owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has presided over a slow-motion demolition, using the cudgel of financial crisis to carry out a political hit. Under the cover of staggering financial losses that have only mounted under his ownership, Soon-Shiong has unleashed a relentless series of layoffs, gutting over 20% of the newsroom and leaving it, in the words of its own union, “a shadow of its former self.”[2] But the carnage isn’t just about the bottom line. It’s about silencing a powerful, critical voice. Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong personally intervened to kill a presidential endorsement that would have angered Trump. He has since been explicit about his goal of imposing a “more balanced ideological approach,” and to do so, he has brought in Republican operatives, including the former head of a pro-Trump PAC, to help reshape the paper’s editorial board. The strategy is clear: starve the newsroom, then restaff it with loyalists. The capture of individual newspapers is only phase one. The next is to weaken any remaining progressive outposts, leaving them vulnerable. MSNBC, long a bastion of liberal politics under its headline star, Rachel Maddow, is being led to the slaughter. Parent company Comcast is spinning the network off, severing it from the newsroom of NBC News and the broader protection of NBCUniversal. This isn't a business decision; it’s an abandonment. MSNBC is being left on the side of the road, an isolated and weakened target ripe for a takeover. The "jokes" by Elon Musk about buying the network and firing its stars are not jokes at all. They are the vultures circling, a public declaration of intent from the oligarch class. And their ambition doesn’t stop at the news. It extends to the very fabric of culture. The persistent rumors that Jeff Bezos plans to acquire Condé Nast (Vogue, Wired, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair) as a wedding gift for his wife, Lauren Sanchez, reveals the endgame.[3] This is the terminal stage of oligarchic conquest where the power to shape global culture is reduced to a personal trinket. It is the ultimate expression of contempt for the public sphere, a world where the means of mass communication become just another luxury good, molded to the whims of our new feudal lords. The Algorithmic Coup: Seizing the Means of Reality Production While the oligarchs have been conducting a hostile takeover of legacy media, they have also been slowly amping up their control of the algorithms that curate reality itself to the vast majority of the population. It’s a hostile takeover of the digital public square by a handful of oligarchs acting in service to an authoritarian regime. The "For You" page and the News Feed have been weaponized, turned from sorting tools into active instruments of political power, used to manufacture consent and crush dissent on a scale that makes old-world propaganda look primitive. Elon Musk’s seizure of Twitter and its rebranding as X is the playbook’s most brazen chapter. Under the fraudulent banner of “free speech absolutism,” he gutted the platform and began the real work: transforming a global communication tool into his personal propaganda megaphone. His philosophy of “Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom of Reach” was a lie from the start, a pretext for a system where his allies are amplified and his critics are shadow banned into oblivion. After his endorsement of Donald Trump, the political agenda became undeniable. Researchers identified a "structural break" in the algorithm, a point where the code was rewritten to systematically favor Republican accounts.[4] The system is now so blatantly biased that it has triggered investigations by the European Commission. The final piece of this ideological propaganda project is Grok, his AI chatbot that called itself “MechaHitler” just last week is being aligned to avoid being "woke," creating a model that reflects his own paranoid worldview back at him.[5] While Musk’s takeover was a frontal assault, Mark Zuckerberg’s at Meta is a strategic surrender. Facing the threat of a vengeful Trump administration, Zuckerberg has preemptively neutered his platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to appease the ascendant right. This is not principle; it is appeasement from a man who was seemingly birthed without a spine or personality of his own. In a sweeping act of capitulation dressed in gaudy chains and baggy t-shirts, Zuckerberg dismantled Meta's third-party fact-checking program, a system long despised by conservatives, and replacing it with a manipulated "Community Notes" model imported from Musk's X. He has opened the floodgates for inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and gender, especially transgender people, ensuring the regime's talking points will flow freely. Zuckerberg has seen which way the wind is blowing and is ensuring his platforms will serve as a hospitable environment for the new power. The final and biggest prize in this digital war is TikTok, the dominant cultural artery for an entire generation. The forced sale of the platform from its Chinese parent company, justified under the pretext of "national security," is a blatant lie. The true objective is not to protect American data, which could be done by passing meaningful data protections, but rather, to seize control of the world's most powerful algorithm for influencing youth culture.[6] The leading proposed buyer is a consortium led by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of Donald Trump's most powerful and loyal allies in Silicon Valley and whose son, David Ellison, is currently finalizing his own takeover of Paramount and plans on repurposing CBS News into a propaganda organ by placing Bari Weiss in charge.[7] Placing TikTok in the hands of a regime loyalist is the strategic masterstroke. It would give them direct control over the primary information channel for a generation that has been historically resistant to their message. It is the power to decide what trends, what is cool, and what is thinkable. The forced sale of TikTok is nothing less than a state-orchestrated hostile takeover of the youth's collective consciousness. The State’s Assault on Truth The oligarchs' private capture of the media is but one arm of a pincer movement. The other is a direct, state led assault by the Trump administration and its allies on any remaining sources of independent information. This demonstrates a core tenet of modern authoritarianism: there is no distinction between the state and the party. All levers of government, from regulatory agencies to the justice system and the federal budget are seen not as instruments of public service, but rather as legitimate weapons to be used to reward allies and punish enemies. From this perspective, these actions are not an abuse of the system; they are the system's intended purpose. The campaign to destroy public broadcasting in America is a long-term, strategic priority for the Trump movement, laid bare in the pages of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's comprehensive playbook for a second Trump term. The plan is not merely to reform public media but to annihilate it. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the complete defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides essential funding for NPR and PBS stations across the country. The blueprint goes further, advocating for stripping these outlets of their non-commercial educational status and even moving them off their desirable FM radio frequencies to make way for religious and Christian nationalist broadcasting. The justification is that public media is a "liberal disinformation machine" that must be dismantled.[8] The rescission package expected to pass Congress this week will zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and claw back $1.1 billion in funding already allocated to the CPB.[9] This effort to starve public media would be devastating, particularly for rural and underserved communities that rely on these stations as their primary source of local news and emergency information, effectively creating vast "news deserts" across the country. That’s entirely the point. They need to ensure that those living in rural areas become hopelessly dependent on propaganda in order to access even basic information about the world around them. The final weapon in the state's arsenal is the legal and regulatory system itself, which is being wielded to intimidate, extort, and co-opt media organizations into submission. The Trump administration is increasingly using every aspect of government to intimidate and coerce media organizations into yielding to its narrative. The most chilling precedent is the $16 million settlement paid by Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, to end a frivolous lawsuit brought by Donald Trump.[10] Paramount has an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media pending before the Trump-controlled FCC. The FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, had already reopened a dubious "news distortion" investigation into the very same interview, placing the merger in jeopardy. Facing this immense pressure, Paramount capitulated. This case is part of a broader pattern of using various federal agencies as a sword of Damocles. Trump and his appointees have repeatedly threatened to use the power of the FCC and FTC to punish their perceived enemies. This includes threats to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like NBC and ABC for "Country Threatening Treason," launching politically motivated investigations into news outlets, and promising to bring these supposedly independent agencies under direct presidential authority. This strategy of direct state coercion creates a pervasive climate of fear, encouraging self-censorship and ensuring that media owners think twice before publishing anything that might anger the regime. The Fool's Freedom The sum total of these actions by the oligarchs to capture legacy media, manipulate the algorithmic control of digital platforms, and use the state to assault any remaining independent voices has created a terrifyingly effective new model of information control. It is a system that maintains the outward appearance of a free and diverse media landscape. We still have websites to browse, podcasts to download, and newsletters to subscribe to. Many will even be harshly critical of the oligarchs and the Trump administration. We still possess, in the narrowest legal sense, the right to an opinion. But this is a fool’s freedom. As Hannah Arendt noted, the most profound deprivation of rights occurs not when you are forbidden to have an opinion, but when your opinion is rendered meaningless. The oligarchs’ control over the critical infrastructure of information distribution is the ultimate choke point. They are the gatekeepers of relevance, the silent arbiters of what is seen and what is buried, what is amplified and what is ignored. This new reality destroys the very possibility of public accountability. An independent journalist can break a world-changing story, a citizen can voice powerful dissent, but if these are algorithmically suppressed, they cannot reach a critical mass. They cannot generate public outrage. They cannot hold power to account. This is speech without consequence, opinion without impact. Arendt’s concept of “action,” meaning the speech and deeds through which we appear to one another and create a shared public world, is rendered impossible. We are witnessing the construction of a sophisticated, 21st-century propaganda state. It is a state that doesn’t need to burn books when it can simply change the algorithm. It maintains the illusion of choice while ensuring, through a seamless integration of private ownership, state intimidation, and algorithmic control, that only one narrative prevails. The choice we are left with is not between different news sources, but between different flavors of state and oligarch approved information. This is the grim reality of the fool’s freedom in which we now live. Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (Expanded edition. ed. 2025) at p. 315. (“The same is true even to an ironical extent with regard to the right of freedom which is sometimes considered to be the very essence of human rights. There is no question that those outside the pale of the law may have more freedom of movement than a lawfully imprisoned criminal or that they enjoy more freedom of opinion in the internment camps of democratic countries than they would in any ordinary despotism, not to mention in a totalitarian country. But neither physical safety—being fed by some state or private welfare agency—nor freedom of opinion changes in the least their fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the nations to feed them; their freedom of movement, if they have it at all, gives them no right to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys as a matter of course; and their freedom of opinion is a fool’s freedom, for nothing they think matters anyhow. These last points are crucial. The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. Something much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are rights of citizens, is at stake when belonging to the community into which one is born is no longer a matter of course and not belonging no longer a matter of choice, or when one is placed in a situation where, unless he commits a crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not do. This extremity, and nothing else, is the situation of people deprived of human rights. They are deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not of the right to think whatever they please, but of the right to opinion.”) ↩︎ Farley Elliott, ‘Devastated’: New Layoffs Hit California’s Biggest Newspaper, SFGATE (May 2, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/la-times-layoffs-latest-20307200.php. ↩︎ Jeff Bezos Rumored To Buy Vogue as Wedding Gift to Lauren Sanchez, ‘Source’ Claims, Yahoo Entertainment (Jul. 7, 2025), https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/jeff-bezos-rumored-buy-vogue-120000915.html. ↩︎ Wes Davis, A Study Found That X’s Algorithm Now Loves Two Things: Republicans and Elon Musk, The Verge (Nov. 17, 2024), https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change. ↩︎ Alejandra Caraballo, The Algorithmic Unmasking: How Grok’s “MechaHitler” Turn Revealed the Inevitable Collapse of “Anti-Woke” AI, The Dissident (Jul. 9, 2025), https://www.thedissident.news/the-algorithmic-unmasking-how-groks-mechahitler-turn-revealed-the-inevitable-collapse-of-anti-woke-ai/. ↩︎ Mike Masnick, Once More With Feeling: Banning TikTok Is Unconstitutional & Won’t Do Shit To Deal With Any Actual Threats, Techdirt (Mar. 14, 2024), https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/14/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-is-unconstitutional-wont-do-shit-to-deal-with-any-actual-threats/. ↩︎ Brian Stelter, CBS’ Likely New Owner Is in Talks with Bari Weiss to Buy The Free Press | CNN Business, CNN (Jul. 11, 2025), https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/media/free-press-bari-weiss-cbs-paramount. ↩︎ Project 2025: What a Second Trump Term Could Mean for Media and Technology Policies, Brookings, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/ (last visited Jul. 17, 2025). ↩︎ Scott Neuman, Senate Approves Cuts to NPR, PBS and Foreign Aid Programs, NPR, Jul. 17, 2025, https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469904/npr-pbs-cuts-rescission-senate-vote. ↩︎ Benjamin Mullin Michael M.

Title: Trump considers changes to H-1B visa program

By WND Staff July 19, 2025 The often-controversial H-1B visa foreign-worker program may be getting updated under President Trump’s Homeland Security Department. The program was meant to provide American firms more options to hire qualified workers, including those from foreign countries. However, as WND has covered extensively, the H-1B system has been used countless times to replace Americans with less expensive immigrants. For example, while U.S.-based Microsoft workers have faced multiple waves of layoffs, including a recent round targeting the Xbox division, the company has already cut more than 10,000 employees across various divisions, including 6,000 in May alone, and hundreds more in June. Between May and June, Microsoft laid off 2,300 employees in Washington alone, including 817 software engineers, according to official WARN Act filings. But during the same period, Microsoft submitted 6,327 H-1B visa requests for software engineer roles matching the same job titles and location as those affected by the layoffs. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! As reported at the National Pulse, Thursday DHS filed a notice of a possible change in H-1B requirements with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. According to the report, the proposal includes a “weighted selection process” for applicants under the capped portion of the program. The filing, however, provides no further details as to how the new system would function. The statutory cap for H-1B visas is set at 85,000 per year. During the 2024 presidential campaign, prominent supporters of Donald Trump publicly disagreed about the value of the H-1B program, with both Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy expressing support. Opinion polls on the program, however, have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the visa program. Trump had previously argued that H-1B visas are “unfair” to American workers, saying in 2016, “I know the H-1B very well. And it’s something that I frankly use, and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it. We shouldn’t have it.” As the National Pulse points out, critics of the program argue that the current lottery system disproportionately benefits larger companies such as Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and leaves American workers at a disadvantage, having to compete with cheap foreign labor. A weighted system could potentially replace the random lottery system as a means to prioritize better qualified visa applicants.

NEW YORK, July 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Merck on February 12, 2025 with a Class Period from February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Merck have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

Title: Mike Rowe warns of massive trade-job vacancies: 'AI is coming for the coders'

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/19/2025 10:19:32 AM PDT by Twotone Blue-collar hero and former host of "Dirty Jobs" Mike Rowe says claims of a massive deficit of trades workers in the United States are not hyperbole. Rowe spoke at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where he sounded the alarm on a serious lack of young people going into the trades. Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized.

To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new.

He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new.

Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

"These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

"They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

I guess that makes him an early millennial. I told him that so long as he was willing to work he would probably never have to worry about having a job for the rest of his life. So far I have been right. There was no way the sparse generations since X would ever replace the Boomers. I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own.

"The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems.

Those employers can hire woke Didn't Earn It (DEI) employees and send them through regular DEI training to remind them of how bad white males are. Get women to do it. They're boss babes. They don't need no man. They can smash the "patriarchy". Mike went to school for a white-collar Communications degree and works in television. It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized. They're asking themselves, "What's in it for me?

Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. Mike Rowe’s Mother Had an Important Warning for Him Before He Met Trump Glad he’s out there. I sometimes wonder if it’s too late for good guys like him. The skills gap does not get closed with a 1-2 year certificate. Too many unfunctionals out there. The power grid is a mess and huge demand is on the horizon from AI. I think AI will be held back by inability to build out the grid fast enough to serve AI consumption. My son was born in ‘82. I guess that makes him an early millennial. I told him that so long as he was willing to work he would probably never have to worry about having a job for the rest of his life. So far I have been right. There was no way the sparse generations since X would ever replace the Boomers. I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own. This is long but at least some of it is worth the watch if you don’t know the story of the demographics and how seriously deficient the numbers of replacements are. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w05QgHwq8Ig&t=590s It seems to me that a lot of people would like these jobs - not everyone is suited to sitting at a desk all day. The real problem is the false stigma that’s been created around them, as though those who do them aren’t ‘smart’ enough to do other types of work. Many of the trades involve high skill levels and require a lot of brain power. The numbers have probably changed since I heard Mike mention them a couple of years ago .... trades people are retiring & for every 5 that retire, there is only one to replace them. If people want to WORK, there are good jobs & good money out there. Our HVAC guy was making 80-90k a year with experience. Many of the trades have programs where you go to school (usually a community college) & get your certificate - they pay for it & you work for them for 2 years (or whatever their terms are).

Title: These 5 S&P 500 Stocks Show New Highs On Declining Relative Strength

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. S&P 500, Blackrock The S&P 500 on Friday hit another new high – it was brief as sellers showed up and the index closed lower by .01%. July has been a month of new highs. It’s also been a month of a declining relative strength indicator. This negative divergence between price and a key indicator might be a problem. The RSI, as it’s known to price chart analysts, is a momentum oscillator. Developed by technical analyst J. Welles Wilder, Junior in the 70s, his work on the subject was first published in the book “New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems.” Forbes in 1980 called him “the premier technical trader publishing his work today.” The issue is not just with the S&P 500. Big, well-known names within the index are also showing weakening relative strength per Wilder’s oscillator. S&P 500: S&P 500 daily price chart, 7 19 25. The red-dotted lines show the negative divergence between the direction of price and the direction of the RSI momentum oscillator. Blackrock: Blackrock daily price chart, 7 19 25. The big asset management firm hit a new high Friday and the relative strength indicator failed to confirm the move by coming in lower than it’s earlier July reading. The stock retreated from the higher price high during the session and closed lower by .16%. Blackrock is market capitalized at $170.97 billion. Genius Sports Limited: Genius Sports Limited daily price chart, 7 19 25. The price just hit a new high. The relative strength indicator peaked in November 2024 and did not accompany the stock on to a higher high on Friday. You can see how the 50-day moving average no longer trends upward. Genius Sports Limited has a market cap of $2.89 billion and it’s a member of the Russell 2000 small caps ETF. MMM: MMM daily price chart, 7 19 25. The relative strength indicator peaked in January and is now lower even as the stock’s price is hitting a new high. Friday’s volume is extraordinary. The candlestick is a bearish engulfing: the high is higher than the previous session and the low is lower than the previous session. MMM has a market cap of $82.47 billion. Raytheon Technologies: Raytheon Technologies daily price chart, 7 19 25. The aerospace and defense company with a market cap of $202 billion has a negative divergence on its daily price chart. The stock just hit a new high and, at the same time, the relative strength indicator could not make it above its mid-June reading. Note that July volume levels are subdued compared to earlier months. Charles Schwab: Charles Schwab daily price chart, 7 19 25. The RSI peak came in mid-May and the measure is now lower as the stock itself makes a new high on decent buying volume. Schwab remains in an uptrend as indicated by the direction of the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. Market cap for the capital markets firm is $174 billion. The RSI is only one indicator of momentum and should be seen in the context of other price indicators. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com. Charts courtesy of Stockcharts.com.

Title: For-Profit Hospital Chain Reportedly Left Patient Lying in Pool of His Own Blood
URL: https://futurism.com/neoscope/for-profit-hospital-negligence
Time Published: 2025-07-19T14:30:41Z
Full Content:
For-profit rehabilitation hospitals are booming in the United States, but their rapid growth is leaving patient safety far behind. The US post-acute care industry, which deals with rehab and long-term care facilities, was worth an estimated $483 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow to over $785 billion by 2034. On paper, it's easy to assume all that business potential would translate to quality care. Unfortunately, for thousands of patients across the country, that couldn’t be further from the truth, as Encompass Health Corporation — the McDonald's of post-acute care, basically — makes clear. Bombshell reporting by the New York Times this week uncovered a horrifying track record by Encompass and other for-profit rehab outfits. Though negligence in rehab facilities might not seem as overtly dangerous as it is in generic hospital settings, it often leads to injuries, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals, and even death. At the Encompass facility in Jackson, Tennessee, for example, a 68-year-old patient was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Per the NYT, a pressure- and motion-triggered alarm meant to alert nurses if he left his bed had been turned off prior to the gruesome discovery. A patient in Morgantown, West Virginia, died a similarly preventable death, after a fall off the bed gave her a "huge gash" on her forehead. There, too, the hospital chain's alarms failed to notify staff in time. "We are having a lot of problems with the bed alarms," a nurse technician told police inspectors after the woman's death, according to an inspection report obtained by the NYT. Another incident in South Dakota led to the death of a 73-year-old man when a nurse administered the wrong drug. That was just one of 26 adverse drug events the Encompass site was responsible for over the span of just six months. Per the NYT, Encompass owns 168 hospitals, and was responsible for nearly 250,000 patients in 2024. In 2023, Encompass helped flip the rehabilitation sector from a mostly non-profit space to a predominantly profit-seeking one. Though non-profit rehab is its own kind of nightmare, particularly for low-income or "charity care" patients, this pivot to for-profit models has come with a notable increase in unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Unlike nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), these types of errors in post-acute care aren't explicitly disclosed to Medicare recipients, elderly and disabled patients who are at heightened risk for medical neglect. Nor are ownership details, such as the involvement of private equity firms or real estate investment trusts — profit-seeking groups whose participation in the medical field leads to worse outcomes in patient care. That's not to say Medicare doesn't keep tabs on rehab facilities, however. As the NYT notes, out of the 41 inpatient rehab sites Medicare judged to have "statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions," 34 were owned and operated by Encompass. Though Encompass has toyed around with private equity spinoffs in the past, its main overlords are institutional investors — professional investment fund managers — such as Vanguard Group, whose fund Vanguard Health was ordered to pay $18 million in claims related to "grossly substandard nursing home services," and Blackrock, whose healthcare dealings have been mired in controversy. Speaking to the NYT, executive vice president and general counsel for Encompass, Patrick Darby, called Medicare's readmission ratings a "crude scoring measure." He added that health inspection violations are "rare occurrences" that "do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns." Whether this is empirically true or not remains to be seen, as the rapidly changing corporate rehab landscape demands further study. Still, it's hard to imagine the families of patients who died under Encompass's care share the executive's attitude.

Further, amid tariff wars while there is broad uncertainty including for India, on a relative basis India is being looked upon favourably, as global corporations look for alternative supply chains. One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the June quarter earnings season just about gathering momentum, we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans during this earnings season in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings last week. Abbott Laboratories (ABT, $209.7 billion) The American multinational medical devices and healthcare company noted India to be among the top 15 priority markets for branded generics: “…India, China and other markets… represent the most attractive areas of growth for branded generic medicines… driven by expanding middle class and growing demand for high-quality health care.” BlackRock Inc (BLK, $167.5 billion) One of world’s largest asset management firm highlighted its transformative wealth platform for Indian savers: “…Jio BlackRock recently launched its first funds… over $2 billion raised… 67,000+ customers… building a large-scale asset management platform in India.” SFS Group AG (SFSN, CHF4.2 billion) The Swiss-based global supplier of precision components and assemblies is strengthening its regional presence with local manufacturing: “…building up local fastener production capabilities… advancing core automotive technologies… developing brake and restraint system businesses in India.” EQT AB (publ) (EQT, Skr398.0 billion) The Swedish global investment organisation described India as its largest market in their Asia strategy: “…India represents the largest part, approximately 1/3rd of invested capital… healthcare, tech services, industrial tech… buyout market expected to triple by 2030.” Firan Technology Group Corp (FTG, C$282.7 million) The Canadian manufacturer of aerospace and defence electronics highlighted India’s aerospace momentum with the opening of a new facility: “…finalized lease for aerospace facility in Hyderabad… Make in India policy + defence spending make it ideal… targeting completion by late 2025.” Published on July 19, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Bitcoin Is Lost In Washington, and Nobody Is Looking for It

Bitcoin may be the most famous cryptocurrency on the planet, but in Washington, itâs suddenly the ghost at the party. This week, lawmakers passed the GENIUS Act, the first-ever U.S. law focused entirely on cryptocurrency. It sets clear federal rules for stablecoins, the digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar and used for instant payments. For the first time, crypto has a legal foundation in America. But hereâs the twist: the bill doesnât mention Bitcoin. And that silence speaks volumes. From Spotlight to Sideline For more than a decade, Bitcoin dominated every conversation about crypto. It was the revolution, the protest, the gold 2.0. Politicians warned about it, billionaires backed it, and banks feared it. Now? The U.S. government just passed the most important crypto law in history, and it didnât include Bitcoin at all. Why? Because Bitcoin doesnât fit the Washington agenda anymore. Stablecoins are the hot new thing in the halls of Congress. Theyâre pegged to the dollar, designed for payments, and (at least now) tightly regulated. Theyâre the kind of crypto lawmakers can get behind: useful, tame, and trackable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is messy. Itâs volatile, anonymous, and built to operate outside the financial system. It doesnât want approval. It doesnât ask for permission. And that makes it a problem for lawmakers trying to modernize finance without surrendering control. Even as Wall Street piles into Bitcoin ETFs and companies like BlackRock embrace it as a long-term asset, D.C. remains silent. Bitcoin is being treated like a relic of cryptoâs rebellious past, not part of its regulated future. A Shift in Crypto Power The passage of the GENIUS Act is a political pivot. Stablecoins now have rules, protections, and the federal governmentâs blessing. Theyâre being embraced by banks, fintech firms, and maybe soon by everyday consumers sending money across borders or paying rent digitally. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is on the outside looking in. Still popular. Still powerful. But politically orphaned. If this trend continues, cryptoâs future may belong to the regulated, dollar-linked digital tokens, and not the decentralized dream that Bitcoin represents. The big question: can Bitcoin stay relevant in a post-GENIUS world? For now, Bitcoin remains king on Wall Street. But in Washington, itâs rapidly becoming an afterthought. In a town where the rules are now being written, thatâs a dangerous place to be. Bitcoincongressregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 19 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market.

Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout.

But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 19 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions.

Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 19 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand.

Title: ₹1 crore savings and life is set? It is high time to relook at your age old middle class dream

“Ek crore ho gaya toh life set hai” -- This sentence has echoed across drawing rooms, chai stalls, the LIC agent brochures for decades and not to mention Amitabh Bachchan’s deep voice emphasising the importance of “ek crore” in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) in early 2000s. It was the ultimate middle-class milestone — the surefire way of making it big in life. But in 2025, that one-crore dream does not hold much water? It’s more of a mirage than a milestone. Because by the time you say “I’ve made it”, inflation, EMIs, and real-life curveballs have already gatecrashed the party. Let’s unmask the myth that ₹1 crore is enough and see why financial “settling down” has become a moving goalpost. 1. Inflation is eating your money faster than you think: In the early 2000s, ₹1 crore could buy you a house, a car, and still leave enough for FD interest to run your household. But not today. In a city like Bangalore or Mumbai, this won’t even get you a decent 2BHK house. Add to that 4-6% inflation, and your one crore will feel like ₹30–40 lakh in no time. Reality: The same ₹30 dosa is now ₹120, and that’s just breakfast. 2. One medical emergency can wipe out your savings: Middle-class families are just one health scare away from financial turmoil. A decent cancer treatment, bypass surgery, or organ transplant costs ₹15–30 lakh. If your health cover is the standard ₹5 lakh from years ago, your savings become collateral damage. One ICU bill = Goodbye one crore. 3. Lifestyle inflation is real: Your lifestyle has levelled up, but have your savings kept pace? From iPhones to impulse Zomato orders, your crore can vanish without warning. 4. Job security is an illusion: And sadly, no private sector job is permanent anymore, not even in MNCs, IT, or startups. One recession, one restructuring, or one AI tool and boom – layoffs, pay cuts, or upskilling pressure. Ask any techie in their 40s — they’ve seen the axe fall. So if your plan was: “Retire early, start a homestay in Goa” with that crore, it is better to rework the spreadsheet. 5. Children’s education costs a fortune: Think ₹1 crore will help you chill post-retirement? Think again. A decent Indian private university will cost you ₹30–40 lakh. Foreign education? ₹1–1.5 crore easily. And this doesn’t even include coaching fees, laptops, or hostel charges. So basically: one child = one crore. Why do we still worship this ₹1 crore figure? Because it feels big. It’s a round, shiny number. But feelings don’t beat facts. And in today’s India, facts are brutal. Financial stability is no longer a destination. It’s a continuous journey and ₹1 crore is just the petrol pump, not the finish line. Multiple income sources: Don’t just rely on one job. Freelance, invest, rent out property — hustle smart, not just hard. Large emergency reserve: It is recommended to keep 6 to 12 months of expenses ready. One job loss shouldn’t lead to moving into your parents’ house. Health and life insurance: Get real coverage ₹25–50 lakh minimum for health. And no, your office insurance doesn’t count when you’re between the jobs. Smart investing: FDs won’t save you. SIPs in mutual funds, index funds, NPS — that’s where your money should be working overtime. Financial literacy: You don’t need a full-fledged chartered accountancy qualification but you definitely must understand inflation, taxation, and compounding. Your financial future relies on it. Most middle-class Indians aren’t financially stable, they’re just financially suspended. One layoff, one surgery, one market crash and the whole “life set hai" illusion collapses like a pack of cards. Ask yourself:If your income had stopped today, for how long would you live your current lifestyle?If your answer is less than 10–12 years — you’re not “settled.” You’re playing financial Jenga, hoping the next brick doesn’t topple everything. “Life is stable only when money works for you in your sleep and your survival doesn’t depend on active income.” So, the ₹one crore dream isn’t dead, it just needs an upgrade – perhaps to a bigger number. Add hustle, protection, awareness, and growth to it and then you’re getting close to “settled.” Catch all the Instant Personal Loan, Business Loan, Business News, Money news, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Treasury Yields Slide After Waller's July Rate Cut Call: Markets Wrap

Bond yields fell as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reiterated his case for a July rate cut, while data showed consumer expectations for inflation improved. Stocks wavered amid earnings. President Donald Trump signed the stablecoins bill in a win for the crypto industry. Short-dated Treasuries led gains as Waller hinted he would dissent if his colleagues vote to hold rates steady in July. Bonds also rose as University of Michigan data showed consumers expect prices to increase at an annual rate of 4.4% over the next year, down from 5% in the prior month. The S&P 500 was little changed. The dollar edged lower, but notched an advance for the week. “Investors have something to cheer about with signs of improved inflation expectations,” said Jeff Roach at LPL Financial. “According to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging.” Meantime, Waller said he sees no sign that inflation expectations are on the rise, which allows the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. He also restated the case the Fed should cut when policymakers gather later this month, given data suggesting the US labor market is “on the edge.” “We think he is correct. The Fed’s role is to think ahead, not look behind, which is what Waller is doing concerning the slowing employment situation,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “Nonetheless a July cut won’t happen.” Money markets still assign near-zero odds of a cut on July 30. They price in about 45 basis points of easing by year-end, down from more than 65 basis points at the start of the month. US consumer sentiment rose to a five-month high in early July as expectations about the economy continued to improve. The preliminary July sentiment index rose to 61.8 from 60.7 a month earlier, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. The report offered further relief after data this week showed US retail sales rebounded in June in a broad advance, tempering some concerns about a retrenchment in consumer spending. To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, macroeconomic data remains broadly supportive, and the recent strength in markets has been impressive, though perhaps even more noteworthy is the prevailing sense of calm amid a busy and often volatile news cycle. “Investors have responded positively to robust economic indicators and earnings reports that highlight continued resilience in US consumer spending,” he said. “The rest of earnings season will be a key test given elevated valuations and expectations, though with current momentum and sentiment, the path of least resistance is higher.” At Wolfe Research, Chris Senyek says economic data releases this week have been consistent with his view that the US economy is coming in better than consensus expects. “However, we continue to be worried about the risk of inflation remaining stickier than expected in the back half of 2025,” Senyek noted. The stock market’s relatively modest gains this week despite mostly solid economic data and earnings could be a preview for much of the rest of the year, according to Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team. “While tariff uncertainty continues, the markets may be learning to live with it, to a certain extent,” he said. “But with a decisive resolution unlikely in the near term and the Fed holding the line on rate cuts, price action at the index level could remain congested.” Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the US’s standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad. Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any deal with the European Union, the Financial Times reported. Meantime, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the two nations could reach a “good” trade deal while signaling the process may take more time. “The lack of any clear damage from the tariffs, solid earnings results, a firm job market, and consumers who keep spending are supporting the high valuations,” said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. The Food and Drug Administration plans to ask Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. to pause shipments of its Elevidys treatment after three deaths were linked to the company’s gene therapies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Humana Inc. lost a lawsuit seeking to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments, a blow for the insurer that had hoped the court would restore billions in revenue. American Express Co.’s expenses grew in the second quarter as the firm made risk-management investments for its affluent consumers, who continued to spend amid economic uncertainty. Netflix Inc. beat expectations for second-quarter results and continues to trounce rival media companies, yet the shares slipped on Friday as investors took a pause after the stock has nearly doubled over the past year. 3M Co. raised its profit forecast and beat Wall Street’s estimates for the second quarter as Chief Executive Officer William Brown’s effort to reinvigorate the company gained momentum. Chevron Corp. has prevailed in a 20-month fight to buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, overcoming a challenge by arch rival Exxon Mobil Corp. that was unprecedented in the modern history of Big Oil. SLB, the world’s largest oil-services provider, sees resiliency in the industry and remains constructive about the second half of 2025 despite uncertainties in customer demand. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. reported total net interest income for the second quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. Charles Schwab Corp. reported earnings per share that topped estimates as the firm said client assets hit a new record and trading revenue rose. Ally Financial Inc. left most of its forecast unchanged despite strong second-quarter consumer auto-loan originations and earnings. Meta Platforms Inc. said it won’t sign the code of practice for Europe’s new set of laws governing artificial intelligence, calling the guidelines to help companies follow the AI Act overreach. The S&P 500 was little changed as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 was little changed The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% The MSCI World Index was little changed Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 0.7% The Russell 2000 Index fell 0.6% The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1% The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1622 The British pound was little changed at $1.3413 The Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 148.73 per dollar Bitcoin fell 1.7% to $117,433.01 Ether rose 3.9% to $3,554.18 The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.43% Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.70% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 4.67% The yield on 2-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 3.87% The yield on 30-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 5.00% West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $67.38 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.3% to $3,348.06 an ounce

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Amid rising infrastructure demands, AI startups like Crusoe Energy Systems are tapping large-scale credit lines, PitchBook reported. Crusoe last month raised a $750 million credit facility from Brookfield Asset Management BAM to expand its data centers and acquire more graphics processing units from Nvidia Corp. NVDA. That deal reflects a broader trend in venture financing. AI and machine learning startups have secured an outsized share of venture debt so far, accounting for more than a third of the $30 billion deployed across the U.S. and Europe, according to PitchBook. That marks a significant increase from 2024, when such companies attracted 24.9%, or $22.9 billion, of total debt funding. Don't Miss: According to PitchBook, the shift toward debt financing is being driven by rising compute costs and high early-stage valuations in AI. "There are companies coming out of the gate with these large chunky seed rounds," Silicon Valley Bank Managing Director, Early-Stage Startups Bo Ren told PitchBook. "But then there's a Series A valuation drop-off because they can't live up to the VC expectations." Ren said that many AI startups are turning to venture debt earlier in their lifecycle as they struggle to maintain growth targets set by their inflated early valuations. Ren also cited infrastructure costs as a key factor: "Given the cost of compute, it's very much like the price of gas, it just keeps going up and up. That's where a lot of the venture debt conversations start," she told Pitchbook. PitchBook data shows that the median pre-money valuation for AI startups has climbed to $25 million so far this year, up from $15 million in 2024. Trending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share Several AI infrastructure startups have recently raised major venture debt deals to purchase high-performance chips. Lambda Labs also raised a $500 million special-purpose financing vehicle, collateralized by GPUs it already owned, to expand its chip inventory. GPU cloud provider CoreWeave CRWE, which recently went public, raised $2.3 billion in debt with similar terms, PitchBook reported. The loan was backed by the company's Nvidia GPU stockpile. See Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25 "How long is the useful life of those chips? If it's 10 years or even seven years, that makes sense," CIBC Innovation Banking Executive Managing Director and Co-Head Paul McKinlay told PitchBook. "But if it's two years, that starts to become a tougher proposition." PitchBook reported that total venture debt deployment reached $53.3 billion in 2024, a 94.5% increase from 2023. That growth was primarily fueled by later-stage startups preserving valuations amid slowing VC rounds. In 2025, AI is driving the next wave of venture debt demand—now extending to earlier-stage companies.

A billionaire who made his fortune at Tiger Global just poured more than $300 million into a high-growth stock that’s skyrocketed over the last year. Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

Title: A small Chinese startup wants to jumpstart a global EV taxi revolution

Time Published: 2025-07-19T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Clay Chandler is executive editor, Asia, at Fortune. On a recent morning in an industrial zone near Hong Kong’s bustling cargo port, a white MG electric taxi glided into a narrow kiosk resembling a car wash. A hydraulic lift elevated the vehicle, allowing a guided mechanical system to slide out the taxi’s depleted battery and replace it with a fully charged one. There was no plugging in, no waiting around to recharge. The taxi was ready for the road in under three minutes. That battery-swapping kiosk is the first of a network of hundreds planned for Hong Kong by U Power, a little-known startup from Shanghai that aims to electrify the beating heart of the city’s notoriously antiquated taxi fleet. The opportunity is huge. In Hong Kong, electric vehicles make up just 4% of the city’s 119,000 commercial vehicles, including taxis, buses, and delivery vans. For taxis, the percentage of EVs is even lower. As of December 2024, Hong Kong had only 90 electric taxis, accounting for 0.5% of the city’s 18,163 licensed cabs. That’s a stark contrast to the 24% penetration rate among the city’s private auto fleet. Hong Kong is representative of a global phenomenon: Of the more than 400 million commercial vehicles worldwide, fewer than 1% are electric. Even in cities with high EV penetration rates—including San Francisco, Oslo, and Amsterdam—electric taxis remain a rarity. In theory, Hong Kong’s taxi owners have strong financial incentives to make the switch. Electric motors, with fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines, are cheaper to run and maintain. Several recent studies suggest fuel costs for EVs are more than 70% lower than for gas-powered vehicles, translating to annual savings of about $10,000 per taxi. The Hong Kong government offers further inducements: it has waived first-time registration taxes for electric taxis and granted a 45,000 Hong Kong dollar (about $5,750) subsidy per vehicle to operators who switch from gas to electric. Still, owners and drivers are wary. For commercial vehicles, especially taxis, every minute of downtime means lost revenue. Conventional EV charging is far too slow for high-utilization fleets. Hong Kong has more than 11,000 public EV chargers, but only about 2,000 are quick or fast chargers, capable of restoring batteries to 80% in 30 to 60 minutes. The rest can take several hours to fully recharge a vehicle—time most drivers don’t have. As Li points out, the average taxi driver earns 200 Hong Kong dollars (about $25) per hour: “You ask them to sit idle for two hours? No way. That’s 400 [Hong Kong] dollars gone.” On top of that, many public charging stations impose hourly parking fees, further eroding the economic case for EVs. Battery swapping stations could eliminate that downtime—but only if U Power can build enough of them across the city and persuade drivers to embrace the model. The company hopes to have four stations in operation in Hong Kong by the end of this year and ultimately envisions a citywide network of more than 200. Hong Kong is a high-profile testbed, but Li has global ambitions. U Power has launched pilots in Singapore and Macau and is actively rolling out swap stations in Thailand, Mexico, Portugal, and Peru. Li sees Thailand and Mexico as particularly promising due to their large taxi fleets and high vehicle turnover. Bangkok, he notes, has 80,000 taxis; Mexico City has more than 100,000. In Thailand, U Power last year signed a strategic partnership with SAIC Motor–CP Co., a joint venture between one of China’s largest automakers and CP Group, Thailand’s largest conglomerate. The venture aims to integrate battery-swapping technology into MG taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. (Disclosure: Fortune’s owner, Chatchaval Jiaravanon, is a member of the family that controls the CP Group, and he is one of U Power’s largest investors.) U Power has also formed a joint venture with SUSCO, a Thai oil and fuel retailer, to install kiosks at its network of 200 gas stations and teamed up with Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Auto Leasing & Service to deploy a fleet of swapping-compatible MGs in the island province of Phuket. And the company now says that it plans to move its operational headquarters from Shanghai to Bangkok in order to fuel its global expansion. In Mexico, the company has partnered with fleet operator Vizeon New Energy to develop swap-compatible EV taxis, buses, and trucks, and install pilot swap stations in three major cities. Similar efforts are underway in Lisbon and Lima, where U Power is targeting midsize fleet operators and delivery platforms. Notably, though, U Power has no plans to enter the world’s two largest markets: the U.S. and China. Li calls the U.S. an EV laggard, hampered by low urban density, fragmented infrastructure, and an unpredictable regulatory landscape for Chinese tech companies. He’s also ruled out the Chinese mainland due to fierce competition, entrenched EV incumbents, and a power grid so advanced that ultra-fast charging is widely available—making battery swapping largely unnecessary. China’s largest cities are notable exceptions to the global dominance of gas-powered taxis. Electric vehicles account for more than 95% of the taxi fleet in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In Shenzhen, the sprawling metropolis just across the border from Hong Kong, authorities have mandated the conversion of the city’s entire taxi and bus fleets to electric vehicles as far back as 2018. U Power’s plans for global expansion sparked one of the most explosive post-IPO rallies in Nasdaq history. When the company debuted in April 2023, shares shot up over 600% on opening day, triggering multiple trading halts. Retail traders piled in, lured by the promise of a disruptive Chinese EV infrastructure play. The stock, which trades under the moniker UCAR, peaked at $901 in June before speculative fervor collapsed. By year’s end shares had slumped to $18. Over the past 52 weeks, U Power’s share price has oscillated between $9.05 and $2.47, with day-to-day swings often exceeding 10%. The stock currently trades below $4.00, down more than 50% year-to-date. No major Wall Street analyst currently follows UCAR. U Power’s stock’s slump reflects investor skepticism about the feasibility of its “battery-as-a-service” model and frustration with its lackluster financials. Critics question whether a battery swap network—capital intensive, dependent on fleet adoption, and distributed across so many different markets—can scale profitably. The company, launched in 2013, remains unprofitable, posting a $7.7 million net loss on $6.08 million in revenue in 2024, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Li insists the company will break even in 2025 and triple profits in 2026, thanks to expanding fleet contracts and growing subscription revenue in Southeast Asia and Latin America. To realize Li’s grand visions, U Power must secure hundreds of viable swap sites in some of the world’s most crowded cities. That’s an especially daunting proposition in Hong Kong, where land is expensive, and each location will require zoning approvals, grid connectivity, and all-hours vehicle access. So far, U Power has identified just ten potential sites in the city. The bigger challenge may be cultural. Winning over Hong Kong’s 17 major taxi fleet owners and some 46,000 fiercely independent drivers means reshaping deep-seated habits and suspicions. U Power’s model requires operators to give up battery ownership, retrofit vehicles with the company’s proprietary UOTTA interface, and pay monthly subscription fees tied to battery use—terms that may not sit easily with a sector long allergic to centralized control. Li insists the economics will win out. By decoupling batteries from vehicles, he argues, taxi owners can reduce up-front costs by as much as 40%. U Power, meanwhile, assumes responsibility for charging logistics, battery health monitoring, and end-of-life recycling. As batteries degrade, they’re rotated into less demanding uses—like stationary energy storage—or recycled outright. To sweeten the deal, Li has floated a blockchain-based incentive system. Each battery contains a chip that logs usage, charging behavior, and wear. Drivers who follow optimal patterns—avoiding peak-hour swaps, returning batteries in good condition—can earn digital tokens redeemable for energy discounts or services. The goal: a transparent, self-regulating marketplace that reduces strain on the grid while rewarding smart usage. Whether Hong Kong’s notoriously unruly taxi sector will buy in remains to be seen. The city’s iconic red, green, and blue cabs—red for Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, green for the New Territories, and blue for Lantau—are instantly recognizable symbols of the city. They’re also famously idiosyncratic. Most drivers still accept cash only and have long attracted complaints of rude service, overcharging, and reckless driving. Reform efforts have repeatedly hit walls: A proposed fee hike in 1984 triggered citywide riots; drivers staged mass strikes in 1991 and 2008; and just this February, the drivers’ union threatened another unless the government cracked down on unlicensed ride-hailing services like Uber. At U Power’s Hong Kong launch ceremony in June, the chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Drivers & Operators Association attended and signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to promote the adoption of the UOTTA system. Notably, though, no representatives of the Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association, which represents the interests of taxi license holders—and is generally considered the more politically powerful of the two major taxi unions—attended the event. Still, the symbolism of electrifying Hong Kong’s taxis is potent. In 2023, when the city’s stock exchange opened offices in New York and London, it marked the milestone with a cheeky global ad campaign featuring then-CEO Nicolas Aguzin rolling through Manhattan and Mayfair—not in a black limo, but in the back of a classic red Hong Kong cab. If Li Jia has his way, the next time one of those taxis makes an international cameo, it’ll be running on swappable power—a symbol not only of the city, but of the future of electric mobility. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

("DoubleVerify" or the "Company") (NYSE: DV) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). DoubleVerify investors have until July 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that:(i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon;(ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors;(iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions;(iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability;(v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and(vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers. The stock declined nearly 39% following this announcement. February 27, 2025: DoubleVerify reported disappointing Q4 2024 earnings and sales, revealing that the shift from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the company. On this news, shares fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

AST SpaceMobile and its giant satellites are facing opposition from a surprising group: Amateur "ham" radio operators. The community is protesting AST SpaceMobile's request to use the 430 to 440MHz band, which includes spectrum already allocated for ham radio operations, including emergency communications. An amateur radio operator in Germany named Mario Lorenz is asking the US Federal Communication Commission to deny AST's proposal to use the spectrum outside the US. “AST seeks worldwide access to a significant portion of this spectrum in a way which would almost guarantee significant international harmful interference,” Lorenz says. Texas-based AST wants to use the spectrum outside the US to track and control its proposed fleet of 248 satellites, which promise to deliver internet connectivity to everyday smartphones in cellular dead zones. However, Lorenz claims AST’s application is “vague” and lacks details about how it’ll harness the spectrum and avoid interference with ham radio operators. Thus, in a worst-case scenario, the proposal is an "unprecedented grab of spectrum, and in violation of applicable Radio Regulations," Lorenz told the FCC. "Unlike Amateur Radio stations in the US, who have a much larger 70cm allocation (420 MHz ...450 MHz) and other bands (220 MHz) not available to Amateur Radio stations in Region 1 (Europe), amateur radio activity is much more concentrated,” he added. “The 70cm band is heavily used. It is one of the few bands available to Novice class operators in Germany.” Since then, other ham radio users have been rallying the community and sending complaints to the FCC, warning about the risk of interference. “Amateur radio has a proven track record of saving lives in wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters,” said another user. "It is widely used for public-service events, community coordination, search-and-rescue, and auxiliary communications for local agencies when all else fails.” The complaints arrive as the FCC has kicked off a process to review and possibly greenlight AST’s proposal to power a commercial satellite-to-phone service through the company’s emerging satellite constellation. AST currently has five BlueBird satellites in orbit, but plans to launch dozens of larger second-generation satellites in the coming months and years to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the turf battle highlights how next-generation satellite constellations can rankle existing services by harnessing radio spectrum already in use. SpaceX, for example, has been waging a regulatory battle to use the radio spectrum that Globalstar and EchoStar currently rely on in an effort to bolster the cellular Starlink service for T-Mobile. AST’s application to the FCC shows it plans on using different radio frequencies to track and control the satellites in the US. The company also notes the FCC cleared it to use the 430 to 440MHz radio bands for its first five BlueBird satellites. But in his letter to the FCC, Lorenz argued: “With a planned total of 248 satellites in orbit, almost certainly there would always be one or more satellites in view, causing significantly more interference potential. “At the very least, the FCC should require from AST a clear showing and commitment to protect the Amateur Radio and Amateur Radio Satellite services,” he added.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

TOPICS: KEYWORDS: ai; bubble; stockmarket; webistics Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-46 next last A big part of the dot-com bubble were the startup companies that went to ridiculous levels and ended up going bankrupt. Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced.

They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

"Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names.

But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. You should use real intelligence to construct a coherent sentence. I don’t think the issue is the efficacy of AI, the issue is too many AI engines, and start ups centered around them, which has led to too much investment concentrated in the category. Use one company’s AI to vet the work product of another company’s AI—while you take a nap! Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks. One that my wife bought for $10 went up 2500 percent (she bought a lot of shares). If she had taken any profits earlier she would have kicked herself. We're sitting on most unless there is a substantial reversal. “Tesla is simply a car maker” You should do your homework before disseminating false information. Remember, AI is nothing more than what some programmer designed it to be, including that programmer’s ignorance, biases, depth or lack of knowledge, experiences, and data sources. Ask it a question like “who is the best presidential candidate” and see what happens. So, AI stock is good for laundering money. One more thing, restoring and recommissioning old nuclear plants to feed the server or data farms? No risk in that is there? Anything is possible if you can get your hands on enough of OPM. It becomes all about he multiples and keeping the show attractive. On the other side of the equation though, I asked google what dividend stocks to invest in for long term income. Three out of the four named are the same ones I spent days doing research and screening to find and ultimately bought. The citations given were complete, current and mostly well reasoned. Same goes for medical diagnosis. Not a complete answer but a decent pointer followed by confirmation. We have been here before at least once in my lifetime. I bought Broadcom waaaaay back but I also bought a few others in that day that have since vanished. I also bought 20% zero coupon bonds back then with the longest maturities I could possibly get. Just wish I had bought more of them. However, like one of my landmen said, “25% of a good deal is probably enough.” He made Billy Bob look like the yokel that he really is. Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

"Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations.

His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become.

You mean NVIDIA at 55 and TESLA at a PE of 177 might be a little over priced? Tell me it isn’t so. /s These are so overvalued and stay that way because they are held by so many who would now rather not but are in too deep. Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy. If I did not already own S&P 500 ETF I would opt for the S&P 493. Yeah, and when you sell it continues to go up! It's all a gamble, either way. We own some AI related stocks. One that my wife bought for $10 went up 2500 percent (she bought a lot of shares). If she had taken any profits earlier she would have kicked herself. We're sitting on most unless there is a substantial reversal. “Tesla is simply a car maker” You should do your homework before disseminating false information. Remember, AI is nothing more than what some programmer designed it to be, including that programmer’s ignorance, biases, depth or lack of knowledge, experiences, and data sources. Ask it a question like “who is the best presidential candidate” and see what happens. So, AI stock is good for laundering money. One more thing, restoring and recommissioning old nuclear plants to feed the server or data farms? No risk in that is there? Anything is possible if you can get your hands on enough of OPM. It becomes all about he multiples and keeping the show attractive. On the other side of the equation though, I asked google what dividend stocks to invest in for long term income. Three out of the four named are the same ones I spent days doing research and screening to find and ultimately bought. The citations given were complete, current and mostly well reasoned. Same goes for medical diagnosis. Not a complete answer but a decent pointer followed by confirmation. We have been here before at least once in my lifetime. I bought Broadcom waaaaay back but I also bought a few others in that day that have since vanished. I also bought 20% zero coupon bonds back then with the longest maturities I could possibly get. Just wish I had bought more of them. However, like one of my landmen said, “25% of a good deal is probably enough.” He made Billy Bob look like the yokel that he really is. Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right.

Title: Netflix Shares Tumble 5% Despite Strong 2nd Quarter Earnings Report
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-stock-reaction-earnings-q2-2025/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T15:11:54Z

While Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish, one analyst argued the streamer’s results and raised guidance were “not good enough for elevated expectations” Despite Netflix’s strong beat on earnings on Thursday, it wasn’t good enough for some Wall Street investors as shares are down more than 5% on Friday. The streamer posted a 16% increase in revenue to $11.08 billion and 45.6% jump in profits to $3.13 billion in its second quarter of 2025, primarily driven by more subscribers, higher pricing and increased ad revenue. It also raised its 2025 revenue outlook from $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion, up from previous guidance of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion, reflecting healthy subscriber growth and ad sales and the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies. The update represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. Though William Blair analyst Ralph Shackart touted a “good quarter and positive tone that business trends remain strong,” he argued the results and guidance were “not good enough for elevated expectations.” “The above-the-Street revenue guide was due in part to a weaker dollar. The outlook for Netflix remains positive in our view, with a strong slate, a broadeningadvertising platform, solid retention, price changes in line with expectations, and stable engagement,” Shackart wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe it will retain pricing power over the long term.” Seaport Research’s David Joyce, who remains neutral on the stock with no price target, added that shares “appear close to fully-valuing the current opportunity sets discounted through 2030.” He acknowledged Netflix can find additional upside with advertising and more price increases, but said it would “take time to become evident.” Others were more bullish, such as Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich who raised her price target on the stock to $1,490 per share and reiterated a buy rating. “In our view, Netflix shares will be fueled by continued positive subscriber and earnings momentum in addition to evolving advertising and live opportunities,” she wrote in a Friday note to clients. “Supported by its world-class brand, leading global subscriber scale, position as an innovator and increased visibility in growth drivers, we believe that Netflix will continue to outperform.” MoffettNathanson analysts Michael Nathanson and Robert Fishman, who maintained a buy rating and raised their price target to $1,400 per share, expect Netflix to continue to disrupt the pay TV ecosystem over time and that it will increase spending as it expands into live event and sports content as well as its in-house advertising technology platform. “We believe the [return on investment] from these moves will lead to even greatermargin expansion and faster earnings growth,” they said. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion, who raised his price target to $1,500 per share, continues to see Netflix as a “defensive name with multiple upside levers.” He expects the company’s content slate to improve in the back half of 2025 and thinks the company’s guidance “bakes in conservatism.” J.P Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth added that he believes the ad-supported tier will further expand the company’s subscriber base while driving high-margin incremental revenue, projecting 60 million ad tier subscribers by the end of 2025.But he acknowledged that after “significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced,” leading him to remain neutral on Netflix stock and establish a price target of $1,300 per share. Netflix stock is up 87% in the past year and 36% year to date. Shares are currently trading at $1,205.96, off its 52-week high of $1,341.15.

As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices.

(NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Title: Netflix Stock To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/18/netflix-stock-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-07-18T12:08:15Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a stellar performer, nearly doubling over the last 12 months to levels of about $1,270 currently. The rally has been driven by the company’s crackdown on password sharing and the expansion of its advertising-supported streaming tier. Momentum has clearly been on Netflix’s side, and Q2 results published yesterday exceeded expectations, with the top line growing 16%. However, we believe the stock faces considerable downside risk at these elevated levels. With mounting macroeconomic uncertainty and signs that subscriber growth could slow, investors may be underestimating potential risks. In our view, the stock could fall significantly - possibly dropping below $500 per share. A 50% to 60% correction may sound extreme, but it wouldn’t be unprecedented. It has happened before, and could very well happen again. In a downturn, NFLX stock could lose considerably. There is evidence from as recently as 2022 that NFLX stock lost over 70% of its value in the matter of just a couple of quarters. So, could NFLX’s roughly $1,270 stock slide to under $500 levels if a repeat of 2022 were to happen? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio - and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JULY 19: The Netflix logo is displayed at Netflix offices on July 19, ... More 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Members of SAG-AFTRA, Hollywood's largest union which represents actors and other media professionals, have joined striking WGA (Writers Guild of America) workers in the first joint walkout against the studios since 1960. The strike could shut down Hollywood productions completely with writers in the third month of their strike against the Hollywood studios. Netflix reported second quarter earnings after the closing bell today. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Why Is It Relevant Now? Netflix’s subscriber growth could eventually slow, as key initiatives like the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported plans have already been rolled out across major markets. These were major strategic shifts aimed at unlocking new revenue streams and expanding the user base after growth plateaued post-pandemic. However, they likely pulled forward demand that might have otherwise materialized over the next few years. This might result in softer subscriber additions going forward. The company’s decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025 could also signal internal expectations of slower growth. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, pushing its paid user base to nearly 302 million as of the end of 2024, a record annual increase that significantly contributed to the stock’s rally. Growth was largely driven by its measures to curb password sharing, which encouraged users to either pay for extra member access or sign up for new accounts. This initiative, now active in more than 100 countries, helped Netflix improve monetization while boosting sign-ups. Meanwhile, the ad-supported tier has gained strong traction, with Netflix indicating last quarter that it had over 94 million ad supported users. However, with these growth levers now largely used up, Netflix may face headwinds in sustaining its momentum, which could impact the performance of the stock. Economic uncertainty, higher costs, could also weigh on Netflix, which is highly dependent on consumer spending. The imposition of tariffs on key trading partners is already causing U.S. inflation to pick up. This could lower disposable income, and potentially weaken consumer spending. This could be a negative for Netflix, which relies on discretionary income. It also doesn't help that Netflix plans have become more expensive, with its premium plan now priced at $25 per month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This could lead to slower new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content costs are set to rise as it ventures deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, that may involve higher production costs and licensing expenses. While Netflix saw margins rise in Q2, it warned that operating margins over the second half of 2025 could trend lower due to higher content amortization and rising marketing costs associated with its content slate. How Resilient Is NFLX Stock During A Downturn? NFLX stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. • NFLX stock fell 75.9% from a high of $691.69 on 17 November 2021 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 August 2024 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $1339.13 on 30 June 2025 and currently trades at around $1,270 • NFLX stock fell 22.9% from a high of $387.78 on 18 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock fell 55.9% from a high of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 Premium Valuation At the current stock price of $1,270 per share, Netflix trades at around 50x consensus 2025 earnings, which appears expensive in our view. In comparison, the stock was trading at levels of around 20x earnings back in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial performance has been strong, markets tend to be short-sighted, extrapolating short-term successes for the long run. In Netflix’s case, the assumption is likely that the company will continue its strong streak of subscriber additions and likely grow revenues comfortably at double digits. However, there’s a real possibility that Netflix will soon see subscriber growth cool, as the twin benefit of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, with economic uncertainty also growing in the U.S. Consensus estimates also point to just about 12%-13% growth over 2025 and 2026. Concerned about Netflix stock's elevated valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Posted on July 18, 2025 by Nick Roach 2 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 19. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t publish a post for Public Alpha 17 and 18, so I’ll cover everything that has changed since then. We implemented 121 bug fixes and improvements, five new features, including Flexbox Layouts, Interactions, Improved Backward Compatibility, Relative Colors, and Find and Replace, and made significant progress on two upcoming features. Regarding bug fixes, almost every team has finished their features and is now focused on fixing bugs in preparation for the upcoming public beta. You can expect bug fixes to ramp up over the next month, with a new focus on testing and fixing migration-related issues. In addition to all the little bug fixes, Public Alpha 19 also comes with a few minor improvements: Of course, these minor improvements don’t include all the big features we introduced, so keep reading to learn about those! We’re moving full speed ahead with feature development. We have seven teams working full-time on Divi 5. Here is what they’re up to. 👇 We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.2. 🎉 Divi 5’s new Flexbox layout system has arrived. This is no minor update. It reinvents Divi, allowing you to build any layout structure, including responsive layout breakdown, custom module ordering, easy vertical alignment and element positioning, and much more. No stone was left unturned, no option was forgotten—we did it all, and it’s best in class. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.1. 🎉 Interactions is a robust system for creating interactive elements such as popups and toggles, and creative scroll-based and mouse-movement-based effects. It’s not a pop-up builder; it’s an anything builder. Create a trigger, assign an effect, choose a target, and bring your custom interactions to life. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18. 🎉 We’ve been testing all the top-selling products in the Divi Marketplace and improving Divi 5’s backward compatibility system so that, when the time comes, everyone will be able to upgrade. With the improved backward compatibility update, legacy modules are now available in the Add Module panel and will function much better than before. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17.1. 🎉 Divi’s color revolution has arrived, positioning Divi as the clear leader in color management and advanced color systems. 🎉 Divi’s color picker has been completely redesigned, and it doesn’t get any better. Using HSL, you can create mathematically beautiful, variable-based color systems that are easy to manage, revolutionizing how you manage colors on your websites. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17. 🎉 Find and Replace is an impressive efficiency tool for Divi power users that will speed up your workflow and play an essential role in helping old websites adopt Divi 5’s new design systems, such as variables. Right-click on any field to find and replace its value within a given scope. It’s a simple concept, but boy, is it useful, and it’s not something you’ll find in most page builders. 🤩 Give it a try today! We gave a sneak peek at Loop Builder last month, and it’s almost finished. Our goal is to release it next week! The idea behind Divi’s loop builder is simple: loop anything! You can create new post-based content by looping sections, rows, columns, groups, modules, and sub-elements. Our first batch of WooCommerce product modules is almost finished and will be the next feature we release after Loop Builder. Here is a list of all the changes implemented in Public Alpha 17 through Public Alpha 19. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. If an existing website depends on a feature that hasn’t been added to Divi 5, you should continue using Divi 4. WooCommerce modules are the only things missing. Even then, Divi 4’s legacy WooCommerce modules will still work in Divi 5 in backward compatibility mode. We aim to enter beta within ~1.5 months based on our progress; 2-3 weeks to wrap up Loop Builder and Woo Modules, followed by a few weeks of focused bug fixing. There are two things we want to accomplish before entering the beta phase, and the majority of our team is now focused on these tasks: Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it “official,” and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback. Stay tuned for a new Divi 5 version every two weeks. Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts. Learn about the new way to manage your Divi assets.

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. economy has been surprisingly resilient while the tariff wars rage even though prices may go up as inventories dwindle, consumers are becoming more value conscious, and investors are by turns sanguine and skittish. (Witness their reaction to the specter of President Trump potentially firing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as my colleague Jim Edwards noted in this piece.) I had a chance to speak with several business leaders at a roundtable convened by Edward Jones Managing Partner Penny Pennington recently at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Her concern was, “how do we help future generations build wealth in this uncertain economy?” With challenges like high home prices and an uncertain job market, she takes a holistic view of the customer. “We’re a wealth and wellbeing company.” The theme of investing took many forms. Bev Anderson, CEO of BECU credit union, focused on creating financial opportunities, while Gallup CEO Jon Clifton talked about the need for better global indicators of how we feel amid a rise in negative emotions. Southern Company CEO Chris Womack is expanding his energy infrastructure amid surging demand at the country’s second-largest utility. Optimism about the power of technology and innovation was mixed with worries about geopolitics and the state of civil society. In an era of growing complexity and rapid change, face-to-face conversations have become even more important for sharing ideas and building trusted relationships. That’s why the dinners hosted by CEO Initiative members around the country have been so valuable. It’s why I’m excited by our upcoming Fortune Global Forum on October 26 and 27 in Riyadh. Among the CEOs who have confirmed their attendance, so far, are Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Ed Bastian of Delta Air Lines, Tony Elumelu of United Bank for Africa, Jane Fraser of Citigroup, Mahindra & Mahindra Anish Shah, Catherine MacGregor of ENGIE, Honeywell’s Vimal Kapur, Gilberto Tomazoni of JBS, and Jenny Johnson of Franklin Templeton.

This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal story,” he said. On social media, he added, “I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.” He also asked the attorney general to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,” on Epstein. Here is a timeline of the relationship between Trump and Epstein. How Sam Altman became Trump’s best AI buddy Initially cut out of the president’s circle by Elon Musk, Altman has been quietly cultivating his relationship with the president, the WSJ reports. With Musk out of the way, Altman is now more influential in the White House. The maneuvering required Altman to renounce his former public dislike of Trump. Trump vs. corn syrup President Trump’s announcement Wednesday claiming that Coca-Cola would substitute corn syrup for raw sugar in their products “cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs … all with no nutritional benefit,” the CEO of the Corn Refiners Association said on Wednesday. The announcement also caused significant dips in the stock prices of some corn syrup manufacturers between Wednesday and Thursday. Morgan Stanley on tariffs Morgan Stanley’s head of US policy, Monica Guerra, describes President Trump’s tariffs as a “mosaic” and “idiosyncratic.” Here’s how much she thinks they’ll bring to the U.S. Treasury—and how they could fuel higher inflation. Europe tightens sanctions on Russia The EU will impose a new set of sanctions on Russia targeting its oil, gas and banking sectors. Twenty more banks will be cut from the SWIFT payments system and there will be new restrictions on Russian oil refined outside of Russia. Meta poaches more AI talent from Apple Former Apple employees Mark Lee and Tom Gunter will join Meta’s Superintelligence Labs, according to Bloomberg. They will join Ruoming Pang, the former head of Apple’s large language model unit, who joined Meta a few weeks ago. Pang was reportedly offered $200 million in compensation to make the move. Deep dive on the growth of private credit JPMorgan recently dedicated $50 billion to debt financing for clients doing acquisitions and other deals. Apollo, Ares, and KKR are extending credit that they originate independently to lock in borrowers for years. In exchange for tying up that long-term money, borrowers are willing to pay higher interest rates than they would get from banks. Fortune 500 Power Moves S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.14% this morning, premarket. The index closed up 0.54% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.4% in early trading. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.32% this morning, placing it above 9,000, which would be an all-time high if it holds. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.6%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.21%. Bitcoin is still above $118K. ING on the Fed: “Firmer retail sales and subdued jobless claims numbers suggest the Fed will keep rates on hold for now as officials assess the impact of tariffs on inflation,” per James Knightley. Oxford Economics on jobless claims: “Continued claims continued their march higher in the week July 5, underscoring how unemployed workers are finding it difficult to find new jobs in a labor market where hiring is slow. Claims for benefits by federal employees posted the largest one-week increase since February. We expect these claims will rise further now that Supreme Court has cleared the way to proceed with layoffs of federal workers while legal challenges continue,” Nancy Vanden Houten. WARC on Reddit’s revenue and user growth: “Reddit has demonstrated remarkable year-on-year growth with global advertising revenue projected to reach $1.8 billion in 2025 (+49.6%) and grow to $2.5 billion by 2026 (+39.0%), positioning itself as a formidable competitor to established Big Tech and digital platforms. … The platform’s advertising reach has grown to 606 million users — representing nearly one in 14 people worldwide, according to Datareportal analysis, surpassing X's reach (586 million) and approaching Snapchat (709 million).” Amazon Ring’s founder is back as CEO with a hard pivot to AI.

Title: Investor Dan Ives Says Microsoft and Nvidia To Hit $5,000,000,000,000 Market Cap in Months, Unveils Four Stocks Primed To Outperform

Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, is predicting that two big-named tech stocks will hit astronomical market caps. In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) will likely each hit $5 trillion market caps by the end of next year as artificial intelligence (AI) advances. “We’re seeing the use cases when it comes to AI exploding and that’s bullish for software and the hyperscalers led by, of course, Redmond and [CEO Satya] Nadella in terms of everything that Microsoft [is doing] – not just $4 trillion, we think that could be a $5 trillion market cap along with Nvidia in the next 18 months.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.8 trillion and is trading for $511 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Ives also believes that several software companies may have explosive breakouts in the coming months. “Software has underperformed. But now it’s not just Palantir, which obviously is our top one in terms of AI revolution. MongoDB, Snowflake, I think IBM is seeing a massive renaissance of growth when it comes to what we’re seeing on AI monetization… I think software, and even cybersecurity, is what I believe could be a significant outperformer across all of the tech sector in the second half of the year.” Palantir (PLTR) is trading for $153 per share at time of writing, while MongoDB (MDB) is trading for $218 per share. Meanwhile, Snowflake (SNOW) is trading for $211 per share at time of writing, and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is trading for $282 per share.

Title: Ads of the Week: Duck boats, Chalamet quirks, milk musicals and ketchup devotion

Advertisement July 18, 2025 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min When hot dogs steal the show, duck boats double as training films, and Timothée Chalamet shops for cattle feed, you know advertising is having a week. These campaigns prove that wit, weirdness, and well-placed heart can turn everyday products into cultural side characters worth rooting for. 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way / Chesapeake Bank Why it works: It tosses out the usual banking tropes in favor of local charm, employee cameos, and a duck boat to prove community banking doesn’t have to be boring. To celebrate 125 years in business, Chesapeake Bank teamed up with agency Familiar Creatures for a campaign that is part ad, part onboarding film, and fully committed to authenticity. Titled 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way, the centerpiece is a 1:45 minute hero spot filmed aboard a duck boat cruising through small-town Virginia, starring actual employees and local characters. Rather than lean on stock footage or corporate buzzwords, the campaign embraces oddball humor and lo-fi storytelling. With nods to Wes Anderson, the spot doubles as a real onboarding video for new hires, highlighting the bank’s values through crochet references, desk décor, and real-life crab cake stunts. The duck boat driver is the actual owner. The crab cake is a 400-pound beast served to baseball fans in Richmond. From social clips like Is That a Duck Boat? to bite-sized 30- and 15-second cutdowns, the campaign taps into regional pride with a knowing wink. It’s a rare example of a financial brand leading with personality over polish, proving that relatability and local flavor can still break through in a category built on sameness. Why it works: It skips fintech jargon in favor of surreal humor and star power, making people curious about money in a fresh way. Cash App’s newest ad taps into Timothée Chalamet’s signature eccentricity. The actor wanders a store filled with strange produce before selecting a mangelwurzel, an obscure root vegetable often used as animal feed. When he tries to pay, the scene shifts into a generational debate about outdated currencies like salt and cowrie shells. The two-minute spot was developed by Cash App’s in-house team, directed by Aidan Zamiri, and written by Elijah Bynum. It’s airing in theaters ahead of Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps, with OOH placements in New York and Los Angeles. A co-designed limited-edition Cash App Card stamp with Chalamet is also on the way. It’s a stylized, offbeat campaign that avoids the usual product pitch and instead makes a cultural statement about how we think and talk about money. Why it works: It turns the daily grind of motherhood into a stage-worthy performance, with milk as the quiet but powerful co-star. MilkPep’s latest campaign, Mom’s Show Must Go On, is a high-energy tribute to moms who juggle snack time, tantrums and living-room dance breaks like pros. Rolled out across TikTok, Netflix, Meta and YouTube, the campaign embraces the humor and mess of parenting while drawing a direct line to milk’s role in keeping moms going. Created by agency Gale, the work casts mothers as lead performers in the everyday theater of home life, with kids as their discerning audience. The creative blends relatable chaos with playful spectacle, making milk feel less like a nutritional box to check and more like a backstage essential. The campaign follows MilkPep’s recent efforts to keep dairy relevant in modern culture, trading nostalgia for emotional honesty and short-form storytelling. It’s a smart shift that connects with parents on a personal level while quietly reinforcing milk’s value. Advertisement Why it works: It turns a safety concern into a simple, actionable idea that empowers parents without talking down to them. Tesco Mobile’s latest campaign addresses a growing gap between generations. As digital slang evolves, nearly half of parents and caregivers admit they struggle to understand the way kids communicate online. To bridge that gap, the brand launched a series of outdoor, radio, and digital ads that decode terms commonly used by young people—some of which may carry more serious meanings than they appear. Created by BBH London, the campaign builds on cultural momentum around online safety, sparked in part by Netflix’s Adolescence, which highlighted how emojis and casual slang can hide risky behavior. The goal is to help parents feel more confident, equipping them to spot red flags and open conversations with their kids. By packaging digital literacy into a clear, creative format, Tesco Mobile positions itself as more than a service provider, it becomes a partner in parenting. It transforms sustainability from a feature into a full-blown creative concept that feels fun, not preachy. To launch its new upcycled ‘Stracciatella Saddle,’ Italian cycling brand Selle Royal leaned into whimsy with a musical stop-motion film that spotlights circular design. Built from discarded saddle materials and foam offcuts, the saddle’s marbled pattern recalls the classic stracciatella gelato—making a virtue of its recycled roots. Created by Milan-based agency Adverteam, the campaign centers on Stracciatella Fella, a frame-by-frame animated film crafted from over 2,000 photographs. Using miniature sets, clay figures, and actual recycled foam fragments, the spot turns reuse into a story of reinvention. The campaign is a smart example of how eco-conscious innovation can be marketed through entertainment rather than education, giving Selle Royal cultural texture and personality in a category that often plays it safe. Advertisement Why it works: It captures a universal truth with humor and clarity: when the food hits just right, nothing else matters. In Lost in Love, Heinz’s latest European campaign, a tennis fan is completely absorbed in his ketchup-covered hot dog, tuning out the match around him as if the world has disappeared. The moment is simple, funny, and instantly relatable. Developed by Wieden+Kennedy and Heinz’s in-house agency The Kitchen, the campaign is rolling out across the UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Italy. It is the first time Heinz has launched a campaign simultaneously across its European markets, with a consistent presence on TV, social and out-of-home. By focusing on one irresistible moment of taste, the work reinforces Heinz's brand promise without overexplaining. It is product-led storytelling with just the right amount of charm. Why it works: It strips away the usual supermarket noise and replaces it with quiet, human moments that feel instantly familiar. In a category packed with price flashes and glossy product shots, Ocado’s Shopping List Stories takes a softer approach. Created by Uncommon Creative Studio, the campaign pairs understated shopping lists with emotionally resonant images, from a blurred photo of a handhold to snapshots of birthdays, breakups, and everything in between. Each list hints at a deeper story. One simply reads: “One tin of Ocado Gold Roast Instant Coffee. Zero words.” It’s minimalist, but it lands with unexpected weight. This outdoor-focused campaign isn’t trying to shout louder than its competitors. Instead, it invites viewers to pause, connect, and remember that behind every grocery order is a life being lived. That shift in tone makes Ocado feel more thoughtful and more human without ever needing to show a price tag. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.
