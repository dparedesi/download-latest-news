The I/O conference in Mountain View, California, has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT. Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta. Google and Xreal debut Aura AR Glasses to rival Meta’s Orion plan Pichai said at the conference: "Over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point." The Gemini app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The Alphabet chief also announced other advancements showcasing AI, including an update to the company's Google Meet video conferencing software that would translate meetings between English and Spanish in real time. And Pichai showcased Google Beam, hardware that makes video chats feel like they are taking place in person, in partnership with HP and based on Google's Project Starline. At the same time, with consumer use of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking the degree to which Google is aggressive in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue. Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari Web browser for the first time. In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics. A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years. The analysts cited a behavioral shift drawing consumers toward AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines. Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser. Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs. Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries. Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a "universal AI agent." At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time. The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat. Meanwhile, Google is expanding other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by "millions" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.

Title: Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2025/uber-launches-exchangeable-bond-deal-featuring-rare-structure/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T00:33:33Z
Full Content:
A $1.2 billion exchangeable bond deal announced last week by Uber Technologies reportedly features a rare structure that is appealing to investors and to Uber. The deal is tied to Uber’s shares in self-driving truck firm Aurora Innovation and includes bonds that turn into equity if the stock exceeds a set price after a set period, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 20). The deal allows investors to participate in the upside of Aurora’s business while limiting the downside, as they could end up with a valuable stake if the price of the shares rises above the conversion threshold, while they can get paid back the par value of the bond at maturity if the stock drops, according to the report. For Uber, the deal provided favorable terms that included zero coupon and a conversion premium above the marketed range, the report said. Uber retains some upside and can defer tax on the gains. Only about 6% of total U.S. convertible debt over the past five years has had an exchangeable bond structure, but that share may increase among companies with solid credit and adequate stakes in other companies, the report said. Uber announced its plans for a private placement of exchangeable senior notes in a May 13 press release. It announced the pricing of the offering in another press release on the same day. “Uber intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include strategic investments, although Uber has not designated any specific uses at this time,” the company said in the first release. Aurora is developing self-driving systems for commercial vehicles like trucks and plans to deploy driverless trucks at scale. When announcing the company’s first quarter results on May 8, Aurora Innovation Co-Founder and CEO Chris Urmson noted that its self-driving trucks are now hauling commercial freight on Texas roads. “We are the first company to operate commercial driverless heavy-duty trucks on public roads,” Urmson said in a press release. “From here we’ll focus on proving the promise of the technology, increasing the value of our product for customers and ultimately becoming an essential partner in the freight industry.” Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure Google to Partner With Eyewear Brands on AI-Equipped Smart Glasses Keep Raises $78 Million for Financial Platform for Canada’s Small Businesses Google Unveils Sweeping AI Upgrades Across Search, Android and Cloud We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Crazy-Good Ticket Deal for Disneyland’s 70th!

Time Published: 2025-05-20T23:39:15Z
Full Content:
Disney has released a new deal for Disneyland & California Adventure admission that beats the current general public 70th Anniversary discount, and offers a ‘fully loaded’ Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi-Pass & more for a crazy-good price. Here are dates & details about the special offer, plus comparisons to other past & present ticket promos, an assessment of the value proposition, and more. For a limited time, guests can save ~$180 per person (!!!) on the purchase of a 3-Day Disneyland Park Hopper Ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for only $150 per day. This special offer is valid for admission from May 20, 2025 through December 19, 2025, meaning it’s not just good for the summer of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary, but also Halloween and Christmas! This ticket is $449.99 for all ages, and is a fully-loaded three-day Disneyland ticket with the Park Hopper option and LLMP. A standard multi-day Disneyland ticket with the same add-ons would cost $601 directly from Disney. Even the current 3-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $546 with the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass, making this fully-loaded deal ~$100 off that discounted price in an apples to apples comparison. As an added bonus, this new 70th deal includes a $30 Disney Dining Gift Card that can be used throughout Disneyland Resort! Of course, that assumes you want the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, and that you will eat a meal of food in the parks. It also assumes you want to visit Disneyland and DCA for three days, as opposed to longer. The 4-day version of the general public anniversary deal–which is the one Disneyland has been “pushing” guests towards by virtue of its superior per day pricing–costs $400 total or only $100 per day, making that the better deal if you’re looking for bottom-dollar pricing. However, that is very obviously not an apples to apples comparison. Once you include the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, the 4-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $623, or $155.75 per day. This ticket deal still comes in below that, at $150 per day (and again, includes that bonus $30 dining card). Of course, there’s a catch (isn’t there always?). This $449 fully-loaded Disneyland ticket deal is only available at Costco, while supplies last. Moreover, it’s only being sold in-store in select West Coast markets throughout California, as well as stores in Oregon and Washington. At present, it’s not available at stores in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, or beyond. (It comes up on an inventory check as either “sold out” or “no match found.”) We paid a visit to our local Costco in Orange County, where there’s a huge display and a total stock of 200 of these discounted Disneyland tickets. There was also a Costco employee lingering around the display, offering her “pitch” for the special offer. I kinda felt like Ron Swanson as she broke things down for me, but I politely bit my tongue and quietly listened to the spiel, which was mostly accurate-ish! Here’s the fine print on the Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal: Tickets valid for use beginning May 20, 2025 and expire December 19, 2025. Tickets may be used on nonconsecutive days. A ticket must be used by the same person on all days. Each ticket is valid for three (3) days of admission to both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, including visits to both Parks on the same day. Each day of use constitutes one full day of use. Tickets are nonrefundable, may not be sold or transferred for commercial use and exclude activities/events separately priced. Offer may not be combined with other ticket discounts or promotions. Subject to restrictions and change or cancellation without notice. To enter a park, both a theme park reservation and a valid ticket for the same park on the same date are required. Check park availability by visiting disneytraveltradeinfo.com/dlrcalendar prior to purchase. Theme park reservations are limited, subject to availability, and are not guaranteed. Guests with a Park Hopper ticket must make a park reservation for the first theme park they wish to visit to begin their day; then they can cross over and switch between parks on the same day after 11:00 AM (subject to availability). The ability to visit the other park will be subject to that park’s capacity limitations, operational hours, closures and other restrictions, and is not guaranteed. One (1) $30 Disney Dining Card for each 3-Day Park Hopper Ticket purchased. Value of Disney Dining Card may not be applied toward the ticket price. Disney Dining Card is nonrefundable and redeemable only for food and beverages at participating locations within the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and other Disney Resorts located in the U.S. Certain parks, attractions, services, experiences and offerings may be modified, limited in availability or unavailable, and are subject to restrictions, and change or cancellation without notice. Park admission and offerings are not guaranteed. Select shows, performances, and experiences, including parades and nighttime spectaculars, will temporarily pause to make way for seasonal entertainment offerings, then resume at later dates. Check entertainment schedules before visiting. If the new Costco Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer isn’t for you due to travel dates or because you need longer duration tickets, see our 2025 Discount Disneyland Ticket Buying Guide for additional recommendations. There are a few notable details about this Costco ticket deal to which we want to draw your attention. First, this special offer does not have a “fuse,” which means you can use the first admission this summer for the 70th kickoff, once again between August and October for Halloween Time (see our Guide to Halloween Time at Disneyland), and then one final visit during Holiday Time at Disneyland (see our Guide to Christmas at Disneyland). Those are just examples–you could do all three days next week, during our favorite week of the year, or from December 17-19, 2025. Second, this Costco ticket deal has a longer eligibility window than we’ve seen for any ticket deal in recent memory. And by “recent memory,” I mean since 2016 when we started tracking these discounts. (It was back then that Costco offered a special DCA-only Annual Pass. Unsurprisingly, it was cheaper than this–but almost everything was a decade ago!) It’s unprecedented for a ticket deal like this to cover summer, Halloween and Christmas. It’s also unprecedented for a discount to encompass several popular holidays without blockouts. Fall Break/Columbus Day, Halloween, Veterans Day, and Thanksgiving are all fair game. You can use this through the third week in December, right before peak Christmas week crowds descend upon Disneyland. For reference, the current Disneyland Anniversary Ticket offer runs now through August 14, 2025. Given the early end of that offer (coupled with this Costco deal), we wouldn’t be surprised to see a special offer for late August through December 2025–but we also wouldn’t be surprised if it’s targeted at Californians, more expensive than this, or doesn’t cover all of these dates. Finally, it’s unclear whether this Costco deal is pulling park reservations from the same “bucket” as the new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer or from regular full-price park tickets. Our assumption is the 70th promo. This is exactly how Magic Keys already work, as well as other recent ticket promos. So it’s really nothing new. Nevertheless, it’s important to understand because these ticket deals are popular–they always are, and that’s even when they’re just for California residents. This is more akin to last summer’s general public ticket deal, but being rolled out at the start of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary. It thus stands to reason that this deal will be bought by a higher percentage of guests, meaning more people in this “pool” competing for the same reservations. As Disney warns, some dates are going to be difficult to book–even when availability is wide open for other ticket types. The good news is that Disneyland does reallocate reservation availability as demand dictates; the bad news is that they aren’t very good at it, and it can be very hit or miss (requiring a strong refresh game). Anyway, just bringing this to your attention because we know some people gloss over the terms and conditions, viewing that as CYA legal language that has no real bearing on the deal. Here, that’s only partially true. The way this new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer works with park reservations is a typical legal disclaimer to avoid (another) lawsuit, but it’s also crucial for you to understand so you don’t end up with tickets you can’t use. The biggest impediments to this Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal at Costco will presumably be a membership to the big-box warehouse store. If you’re more of a Sam’s Club house, this does you no good. Even if you are a Costco member, you might have issues purchasing this if you live outside of California, Washington or Oregon since it’s in-store only. When we asked an employee, they did indicate that inventory was limited and their store had received an initial stock of 200 tickets. They were unsure if the deal would be restocked, or if this was it–and it was over once it sold out. Waiting until you arrive in California for your vacation to buy these discounted tickets at Costco is a gamble. Not only because they might already be sold out, but because park reservations are required and those might be gone. If you’re a Costco member living on the West Coast and this special offer is available at your local store, this deal is pretty much a no-brainer. But if not, you might want to consider the current general public deal instead. As a reminder, the general public Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is available now through August 14, 2025. You can purchase tickets directly from Disney or buy this deal via Get Away Today with even greater savings. Here’s a pricing breakdown and other important details… 3-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $120 Per Day 4-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $100 Per Day In a normal year, there are two main types of ticket deals. There’s the summer one, which has morphed from a Golden State deal for all Californians to a general public discount in the last two years. Historically, the summer deal with the wider eligibility pool costs more. Before that, there’s the winter and spring special offer–which ran this year until May 15, 2025–that’s only available to Southern California residents. Disneyland has done this consistently for at least the last decade. It’s the much more established and longstanding deal–the summer discount is more recent addition during the post-reopening era. This year’s version of that SoCal resident deal is the best we’ve seen in a while, and is actually better than last year–and significantly so. It offers discount admission for as low as $67 per day on select days with the purchase of a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket. That deal beats this Costco in terms of bottom line price (which we assume matters to at least some degree if you’re in the market for discounted tickets), but not on an apples to apples basis once accounting for Park Hopping and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass. Since this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is unlike anything that came before it, I’m just going to share special offer ticket prices from the last several years and let them speak for themselves… 2025 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 All Guest Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2021 California Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2020 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2019 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2018 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2017 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2016 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: Ultimately, this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is a crazy-good deal if you’re at least semi-local and wanting to make a few visits to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure for the 70th Anniversary, Halloween, and Christmas. (For recommendations on when to do DLR, see our list of the Best & Worst Weeks to Visit Disneyland in 2025 & 2026.) That’s especially true if you want or need all of the bells and whistles on your admission, as this degree of discount is unprecedented in the last decade or so. What amounts to around $180 off per ticket is a tremendous savings, even if it does require buying the fully-loaded option with all of the add-ons. If you want longer duration tickets, live outside the West Coast, aren’t a Costco member, or are more concerned with getting the bottom-dollar price, there are better alternatives for you. Regardless, it’s great to see a discount that’s this aggressive, and better that what Disney is offering directly. This is surprising to see right as the 70th starts, and suggests that more deals are in the pipeline! Planning a Southern California vacation?

Thanks for the tip, I was about to spend $1858 for 4 x 2 day tix with park hopper and LL so not only do I save some money, but get an extra day for future use and $120 in dining gift cards. The first Costco I went to was already sold out (this was yesterday and evening) but that store was able to locate other stores nearby that still had some. They only got 100 of them. This is two years in a row where I’ve scrambled to buy tickets from reputable third party companies when price hikes are announced only to see much, much better deals come later on (last year was WDW but this time it’s DLR.) Regrets. Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets? After this happening two years in a row, I think I’m going to avoid the price hike rush and just put off purchasing as long as I can…I think. Does anyone know about who is allowed to use the purchased tickets? My wife and I who live in Pennyslyvania are planning to visit our California friend. If she picks up the Costco deal for herself and us, would we be able to use it if we are not the original purchaser or Costco members? There’s no residency restriction! What you’re describing would work perfectly fine! I am so disappointed that these are only offered in person. We have a trip planned for June with 6 of us for 3 days and this deal would save us over $700. I can’t take the gamble that they (and park reservations ) would be available when we land and I don’t know that I could trust sending someone over $2500 to get us some. Unfortunately we’ll just have to go through Disney and spend the extra $700 that could have helped elsewhere. Roberta, your Costco app has an option to search the inventory in your local warehouse. I would try that on all the Costco‘s within a 50 mile radius of you. It shouldn’t take longer than 10 minutes, and some posters below are saying they have seen the tickets in non-West Coast Costco‘s. I found these at Costco in Boise so at least some Idaho stores are also included. I think it’s really important to highlight the non-consecutive restriction more. I asked a friend in CA to buy for me and luckily I caught it before he bought because I’d have to add an extra night onto my trip to make it work and other people with short trips might not realize. From the way I read it, nonconsecutive is an option, rather than a restriction. That is, it says you “may” use it on nonconsecutive days (and spread them out however works for you). It doesn’t say “must” be used on nonconsecutive days, meaning you have no other option. Ah I think you’re right Lori. Thanks for catching that for me!! This is such a great deal! Hoping they are still available when I can get up to Oregon to buy one. Question: Can these be upgraded to a 4 day, 5 day, etc.? I’ve upgraded before when buying tickets from Get Away Today or others, and it’s never been a problem. I’d love to take advantage of the 4 day Anniversary deal, but we’re not going until the first week of December! (Thanks for the rec on that one Tom, looking forward to the cooler weather and low crowds!) This is an ABSURDLY good deal. Hope Costco doesn’t run out before we can get over there!! No weekend blackouts? Includes LLMP? Comes with a random $30 gift card? Valid from MAY TO DECEMBER?! The only possible downside is reservation availability, but as long as you book in advance ur chilling. It really is! Our parents don’t necessarily “need” Park Hoppers or LLMP when they come out to visit, but we’re still debating getting this over the current ticket deal for them. The big thing for us is the December expiration–visiting once this summer, once in October, and once in early December would be fantastic. I just purchased tickets for DL for this June and was shocked at this price savings, $300 less than what I just paid, but then didn’t feel quite as bad when I read the details. What a fantastic deal if you happen to live in CA! Wow. This is an amazing deal. I wish they’d make it available across the country because this is about $10 less than I paid for a 2-day Park Hopper with Lightning Lane Multi Pass ticket through Get Away Today for a trip in March and that obviously didn’t include the dining credit. One element that made last summer’s deal so much better was that it also included kid’s prices equivalent to the 50% off tickets offered in the Winter off-season. That made it easily the best publicly available deal in recent memory. This deal is definitely aggressive and I appreciate it. I don’t think we’re going to get a trip in this year, but if deals keep being this good it’s at least a little more likely. Thanks Tom!!!

Title: Upfronts 2025 Takeaways & Report Card: Amazon and Netflix Return Strong, Scripted Programming Purged on Broadcast
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/upfronts-2025-takeaways-report-card-amazon-netflix-nbcu-fox-1236405146/

Music always plays a large role at the annual TV upfronts, as media buyers, journalists, execs and other attendees are ushered in and out of these showcases to loud playlists — often spun by celebrity DJs. But this year, one number heard throughout the week came with a hefty dose of irony: Doechii’s popular track “Anxiety.”In the song, Doechii sings about how her anxiety “keep on trying me / My anxiety, can’t shake it off of me.” Perhaps a bit too on the nose for the media congloms to be piping into Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom and other upfronts venues. After all, no matter how hard media execs try to spin that things are fine — that’s hardly the case: Production is down, budgets keep getting slashed and studios like Paramount Global (still awaiting news on its Skydance merger) continue to be the subject of speculation about their ultimate survival.Anxiety rules this business, and yet, the show must go on. Last week NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and YouTube all promoted their broad portfolios, with varying degrees of success.Live sports are clearly still the driving factor in the conglomerates’ programming strategies, and movies are part of upfronts now. A decline in scripted programming on the broadcast networks’ fall schedules is a telling sign that the TV business continues to evolve, with some of the biggest scripted bets of next season (like “The Office” follow-up “The Paper”) going to streaming instead of the traditional Big 4.By the end of upfronts week, attendees heard so many competing pitches for their ad dollars that it was hard to keep the messages straight. But here are some of Variety’s biggest takeaways from the 2025 upfronts. Related Stories VIP+ Xbox Price Hikes Are Make-or-Break Moment for Game Pass Pharrell Williams and Audra McDonald on Putting Dandyism on Display at the Met Gala: 'It's About Time' What Recession? Popular on Variety It’s an undeniable fact: The entertainment business is in roughfinancial shape. Like the rest of the country, media companies have been affected by President Trump’s tariffs and general economic upheaval. The Peak TV era, marked by blank checks for massive tentpole productions, is over. Earnings have taken a hit. Layoffs have impacted thousands. Everyone is on the hunt for more cost-effective programming. Of course, you’d get very little sense of that had you attended the upfronts. Save for a scant few passing mentions, you’d have no idea that Hollywood is facing these economic choppy times.Martin Short told the audience at Disney’s presentation that “there’s no tariffs on standing ovations,” earning a guffaw, while one Fox exec at the Manhattan Center told the crowd, “The winds of change continue to sweep through our industry and our economy.”That’s about it for mentions of anything to do with the economy this upfronts week. Understandably, media companies don’t want to scare advertisers with lots of doom and gloom. Much of TV is about escapism, after all. But completely ignoring reality is not the best policy either.Scripted Purge on Broadcast Scripted programming took a big hit on the broadcast networks this upfronts season. With the release of the fall schedules, nearly all of the major broadcasters have shifted their focus to unscripted programming and sports.The numbers don’t lie: ABC will have only five hours of scripted programming a week in the fall. Fox will have four. NBC canceled five scripted shows, with virtually no pilots in the works to replace them. CBS was the only network that committed heavily to more scripted shows, but even those were mostly spinoffs (sorry, “universe expansions”). Those included “Sheriff Country,” “Boston Blue,” “CIA” and “Y: Marshals.”Scripted shows cost more to make, and the broadcast networks aren’t drawing nearly as many customers as streamers. And there was never any doubt NBC was going to eventize the return of NBA coverage on the network.But if there’s one thing broadcast can do well, it’s weekly procedurals and broad comedies. Both formats continue to be popular, but the networks don’t seem in any rush to find the next big show.One thing’s for sure — the nostalgia reboot/revival wave has officially crashed. NBC axed “Suits LA” after just one season, despite the original show’s massive streaming success. The network also canceled the “Night Court” follow-up with Melissa Rauch and John Larroquette after three seasons, even though it started out strong in the ratings. Maybe it’s time for some original ideas to get their time in the spotlight? What’s in a Name? Whomever media companies are paying to come up with the names for new platforms deserves either a raise or a demotion. A major theme of the upfronts was branding or rebranding (or re-re-branding, in one case) with names that lacked creativity.Among the top stories of the week, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed that Max would be known as HBO Max … again. Two years after the David Zaslav regime dropped the HBO part of its streaming service’s name, HBO boss Casey Bloys announced onstage that “HBO Max” was back — earning a wide range of reactions, from laughter to applause. It could have been worse. They could have gone with Max+.Meanwhile, Disney unveiled its ESPN streaming service, which will be called … ESPN. The streamer will offer an unlimited plan that includes all ESPN networks and ESPN broadcasts on ABC for $30 a month. The irony is, that’s more than is currently offered on ESPN+. As Jimmy Kimmel put it during his annual upfront roast, “The plus is now, in many ways, a minus.”Finally there is Versant, the spinoff of NBC-Universal that will house cable brands like USA Network, Syfy, E!, CNBC and MSNBC. Aside from the fact that no one can tell you what “Versant” means, the name lacks the pop of SpinCo, the moniker the company used before someone landed on its official name.“We Come to This Place for Ad Sales” It’s official — movies are as much a part of upfronts as TV. While upfronts were once exclusively about television shows, feature films now play a major role in media company pitches to advertisers.NBCUniversal, for the second year in a row, spent a lot of time talking up “Wicked” and its sequel, “Wicked: For Good.” Donna Langley, chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, and director Jon M. Chu both took the stage to hype the sequel and reveal trailers and a musical special coming to NBC. Not only that, but ad sales chief Mark Marshall made his entrance from the rafters dressed in a Glinda-inspired pink suit.Amazon’s upfront featured appearances by John Cena, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who talked up their upcoming films with Prime Video. Courtenay Valenti, Amazon’s head of theatrical and streaming film, hit the stage to delve into the film slate. She talked about Amazon’s “Thomas Crown Affair” reboot with Michael B. Jordan — with Jordan himself coming out to reveal a series spinoff of the “Creed” film franchise.Over at the Warner Bros. Discovery upfront, the company devoted a big portion of its presentation to James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios. In fairness, that included DC TV shows like “Peacemaker” Season 2 and the upcoming “Lanterns,” but it also had Gunn, Safran and Shaquille O’Neal revealing a brand-new trailer for Gunn’s “Superman” movie.While companies are all about showing off their entire portfolios to advertisers, it’s still jarring to see that TV is only a portion of the upfronts experience now. Sports, Sports, Sports Sports programming has always been a major factor at the upfronts, but never more so than now. Linear TV still has the edge when it comes to live sports, and outlets like NBC are making the most of that. The broadcaster made its 11- year deal for NBA and WNBA rights a central part of its upfront, bringing out multiple current stars and revealing that Michael Jordan will be part of the network’s basketball coverage.Other traditional TV outlets, in an effort to stave off live sports gains made by streamers, have gone all in not just on major players like the NFL, the NBA and the NHL, but also on basically any sports rights deal they can get their hands on. College-level sports of all kinds and smaller leagues got their time in the spotlight. But streamers made their sports presence felt more than ever. YouTube will livestream an NFL game for free in 2025. Amazon and Netflix announced major games for “Thursday Night Football” and the Christmas Day doubleheader, respectively. Netflix got NFL commissioner Roger Goodell onstage (in a Santa coat, no less) to announce the 2025 Christmas surprise.Of course, not all the sports moments were highlight reel-worthy. At Fox’s presentation, Tom Brady somehow missed an easy pass to Rob Gronkowski, with the ball sailing into the crowd, while Blake Griffin got smoked in a Pop-a-Shot shoot-off against former NFL star Ryan Fitzpatrick Upfronts Report Card Amazon Grade: ABest star moment: Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger going off scriptBest pitch: Michael B.

As Seth Meyers joked, it sounds like a medication, not a media organization.Biggest bet on a show NBA on NBC NBCU’s presentation took two hours and felt even longer. But the company had a lot to promote (including fan favorites BravoCon and “Wicked”), and shout-out to Mark Marshall for risking his life with his flying entrance. Netflix Grade: ABest star moment: Jerry Jones going way off scriptBest pitch: Jude Law and Jason Bateman teasing “Black Rabbit”Best use of music: “Thunderstruck” featuring the Dallas Cowboys cheerleadersWorst use of jargon: “Our biggest titles … are not just shows anymore. They’re vibes.”Biggest bet on a show: “Stranger Things” final season Netflix put on a much heftier showcase of its new and returning offerings than it did last year. The presentation ran barely 80 minutes, but packed in a ton of info and news. Warner Bros. Discovery Grade: B-Best star moment: Conan O’Brien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest pitch: Conan O’Brien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest use of music: Guns N’ Roses’ “Patience” in the “Task” trailerWorst use of jargon: “We believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition.”Biggest bet on a show: “Dancing With Sharks” (yes, that’s a real show) Warner Bros. Discovery was doing well at first, but its event went on too long. Maybe Tony Shalhoub didn’t need to hype his bread show? This upfront also definitely lacked the razzle-dazzle and star power of years past. YouTube Grade: B-Best star moment: Lady Gaga’s rollicking five-song setBest pitch: Creator Brittany Broski saying her BroskiReport podcast channel has “1 million subscribers who never hit the ‘Skip ad’ button”Best use of music: Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” as CEO Neal Mohan’s walk-on songWorst use of jargon: “Culture,” as in YouTube is “the epicenter of culture” YouTube had only one major piece of content news to share: Its rights deal with the NFL to livestream a free game in the 2025 season. They did a good job of showcasing new ad formats, creators and marketing results. And Gaga’s performance brought down the house.

"AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure—just like the internet, just like electricity—needs factories," Huang told the audience. "You apply energy in, and it produces something incredibly valuable: tokens." The company introduced the idea of these data centers as new "AI factories," reimagining their purpose as facilities specifically optimized for artificial intelligence workloads. As a first step toward significant expansion, Nvidia announced NVLink Fusion, opening its "interconnect" technology to other manufacturers. This system enables customers to integrate processors from other companies alongside Nvidia's GPUs. "A tectonic shift is underway: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected—AI is being fused into every computing platform," Huang said in an official press release. "NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures." This development is particularly significant as it provides developers with more hardware choices, even from third-party providers, for training their models. Companies can now build semi-custom AI systems tailored to specific workloads, optimizing for cost, performance, or specific architectural advantages. Partners including MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence are among the first to adopt this technology. Another important development, announced separately from Computex, is that Nvidia expanded its partnership with Neocloud providers. Such providers focus almost exclusively on renting high-end GPUs, such as NVIDIA’s H100, H200, A100, and upcoming Blackwell chips, for AI-specific workloads like training large language models (LLMs), computer vision, and inference. Some of these new “cloud partners” include CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. As part of its vision of establishing “sovereign AI” development, the company announced partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop massive infrastructure for AI training and deployment, mainly driven as part of Trump’s chip accords. The market has responded positively to these announcements, with Nvidia's stock growing almost 60% since its dip on April 7. On Monday, though, the stock was relatively stable—as it has been for the last 4 days—going from $132.39 to $135.35. NVDA finished Tuesday's trading day just below the $135 mark. Nvidia also emphasized that NVLink enables compatibility between Qualcomm processors and Nvidia GPUs. This could lead to AI computers featuring energy-efficient CPUs paired with Nvidia's high-performance GPUs, or even mobile hardware with Nvidia GPUs for faster inference and enhanced gaming experiences. The company also revealed plans for a new local headquarters called Nvidia Constellation in Taipei's Beitou Shilin Science Park. Nvidia is also expanding to Taiwan, where the company plans to expand its quantum operations. For individual developers, Nvidia introduced DGX Spark, a compact AI workstation built by partners including ASUS, Dell, and MSI. Powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, it offers 1,000 AI TOPS with 128GB memory, supporting models up to 200 billion parameters. Just for context, Nvidia’s most powerful consumer GPU, the RTX 5090 packs up to 32GB of memory, and starts at $2,499. "Direct descendants of the DGX-1 system that ignited the AI revolution, DGX Spark and DGX Station are created from the ground up to power the next generation of AI research and development," Huang noted. Reservations for the DGX Spark start at $3,999 per unit. Addressing concerns about AI's impact on employment, Huang presented a different perspective. Rather than causing a job crisis, he sees AI as the solution to an impending workforce shortage. "We'll have a shortage of workers by 2030—about 30 to 50 million people short. It's actually limiting the world's ability to grow," Huang said. "Now we have these digital agents that can work with us. One-hundred percent of Nvidia software engineers now have digital agents working with them to help develop better code more productively." Looking further into the future: "The reason why humanoid robotics are so important is because it is the only form of robot that can be deployed almost anywhere," he said, adding that “this whole new industry is going to expose us to giant opportunities ahead."

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Elon Musk has been the center of the media landscape for the past few hours, courtesy of the near-constant trickling of tantalizing soundbites. Now, the world's richest person has set the proverbial tongues wagging by expressly stating that his political engagements with the Trump White House will continue. ELON INTERVIEW AT QATAR FORUM – FULL VERSION Here's the full interview with Elon Musk at the Qatar Economic Forum a few minutes ago. Timestamps: 0:44 A typical week for Elon1:40 Tesla’s situation has already turned around3:55 Elon's compensation important to control Tesla… pic.twitter.com/G3SxPgBEdP — ELON CLIPS (@ElonClipsX) May 20, 2025 Elon Musk recently gave an expansive interview on the sidelines of the Qatar Economic Forum. Interestingly, Musk conveyed a sense of optimism around Tesla's demand equation, asserting that the EV giant has "already turned around," with lingering weakness reserved for Europe alone. Bear in mind that Tesla sales declined around 10 percent year-over-year in Q1 2025, as the launch of a refreshed version of Model Y idled factory capacity for retooling, and Musk's political role at the White House prompted a partisan backlash. Meanwhile, in Europe, Musk's emphatic support for the far-right AfD in the recent German elections also led to widespread calls for a boycott. ELON MUSK: PLANS TO BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE COUPLE OF DAYS EVERY FEW WEEKS — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Now, additional soundbites from Elon Musk are adding oxygen to the ongoing media frenzy. First, Musk has stated that he still intends to spend "a couple of days" at the White House "every few weeks." This goes against the impression that Musk had conveyed during the Q1 2025 Tesla earnings call, where he implied that his DOGE work was "mostly done." ELON MUSK: DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE PLANS TO MERGE TESLA, XAI MERGING TESLA AND XAI NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION, WOULD NEED SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Next, while not completely ruling out the possibility, Elon Musk has denied the presence of any immediate plans to merge Tesla with xAI. This comes as xAI recently acquired the social media platform X in an all-stock deal that valued the former at $80 billion and the latter at $33 billion, inclusive of $12 billion in liabilities. This meant that the deal bestowed a gross valuation of $45 billion on X before factoring in its debt load of $12 billion. ELON MUSK: EXPECTS TO BUY 'A LOT' OF NEXT-GENERATION GPUS FROM $NVDA, $AMD; “NVIDIA IS STILL BETTER THAN WHAT WE MAKE” — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Finally, in a nod to NVIDIA's continuing dominance in the AI silicon arena, Elon Musk has declared he expects to buy "a lot" of GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD, going on to note that NVIDIA's offerings are "still better than what we make" in what is an allusion to Tesla's in-house ASICs.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The new format, called Diamond & Pearls, officially launches May 29 in Delray Beach, Fla. Senior Editor, Retail David’s Bridal Inc., seeking to lift its image and widen its appeal to a higher-income audience, has launched a new retail format called Diamonds & Pearls. “It’s a boutique concept, with a curated and tech-enhanced experience blending affordable luxury and couture with a refined, elevated environment,” said Elina Vilk, president and chief business officer of David’s Bridal, in an interview. “Today’s brides are looking for more than a dress. They are looking for an immersive, shopping experience.” With the opening of the 3,500-square-foot Diamonds & Pearls at 9097 West Atlantic Avenue, Suite 104 in Delray Beach, Fla., “We saw an opportunity to reimagine the bridal journey through innovation, curation and style,” Vilk said. The official opening is May 29, though there’s already been a few “soft opening” days to get out any kinks. Related Articles Fashion Features Brides Like '90s-style Wedding Gowns, Brown Flowers and Lace-like Nails, Pinterest Says Designer and Luxury Giambattista Valli Won a Bridal Award in Barcelona Compared with the 193 David’s Bridal stores around the country, and their no-frills, moderate price presentations, Diamonds & Pearls takes a contemporary and personalized approach for the brides, bridesmaids and special occasion categories contained in a smaller space. It still has some of the same selections as David’s Bridal, with approximately one-third of the stock keeping units typically found in a traditional David’s Bridal store, but is curated to the most trending styles and silhouettes. There are also some exclusive designer offerings, from Viola Chan and Marchesa, as well as David Bridal’s signature lines such as Galina Signature, Oleg Cassini and Melissa Sweet, among other labels. Chan will work with clients on a custom design, either in person or through virtual calls. In addition, appointments can be arranged with personal stylists, Champagne is served, walk-ins are welcomed as well and trunk shows are planned. You May Also Like Inside the shop, interactive digital touchscreens powered by Shopify POS provide clients access to David Bridal’s full inventory of dresses, accessories and shoes. “Internally, we are calling it the store of the future,” Vilk said. The future may bring additional Diamonds & Pearls stores, as the company is close to signing another lease on the Northeast Coast. But before green-lighting an expansion of Diamonds & Pearls, Vilk and her team will analyze the performance of the first store for the next four or five months. “We are ‘test and learn’ people,” Vilk said. “We want to see how this store goes, but we anticipate this will be a big part of our strategy next year.” There’s been “so much demand” for the kind of bridal shopping experience Diamonds & Pearls provides. Prices start at $400 to $500, average just over $2,000, and go as high as $6,000 or $7,000 for a custom couture gown, Vilk said. “We are way more affordable than many bridal boutiques,” she said, suggesting other boutiques typically average out with a $4,000 to $5,000 price point. The launch of Diamonds & Pearls reflects David’s Bridal’s rebuilding efforts after going in and out of bankruptcy two times in the last seven years, in 2018 and 2023, leading to the sale of the company to asset manager Cion Investment. (“Diamonds and Pearls” is also the name of a 1991 Prince album.) “We’re actually doing pretty well,” Vilk said when asked how the business is currently performing. “We are completely changing the strategy and driving innovation with concepts like Diamonds & Pearls, becoming more asset-light and taking a tech-forward approach.” Vilk said David’s Bridal is rebuilding its wedding planning service, started a retail media company in January, and is looking at new AI tools. “Gen Z brides are tech-forward. They don’t start their journey in the store anymore. She’ll browse online first, then see it on social media,” said Vilk, a former Hootsuite, Meta, PayPal and Visa executive. “And she wants affordable luxury.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: US Ambassador to Israel: 'America is your friend—we stand with Israel against evil'
URL: https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/408688
Time Published: 2025-05-20T20:10:15Z
Full Content:
In a defiant and impassioned address in Tel Aviv, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee declared that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not only unshaken—it’s indivisible. Speaking to an audience of Israel’s top economic leaders, Huckabee rejected any notion of drifting ties between the nations. Framing Iran as the common source of regional threats, he vowed unwavering US support for Israel. "To anyone who says that the paths of Israel and the US are going their separate ways, that there is a conflict between them or that they are moving away from each other, I say: that is not what is happening. The only thing that was separated in this part of the world was the Red Sea, when Moses parted it in two to allow the Israelites to pass. I came here today in the name of friendship and gratitude," declared the US Ambassador at a festive reception held in his honor by the Ministry of Finance and the Israel Securities Authority on Tuesday evening, in the presence of the heads of the economy. Huckabee added that he "prays that God will cross the Red Sea again and allow the kidnapped to return home." “I realize that as I stand here tonight there are enemies poised to do any and everything they can to destroy you, to take you down and to take your future and your hope away. But they won't be able to do it. On all sides, whether it's Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis. I've said several times this week, it doesn't matter who brings the plate of hate to Israel to try to destroy you. We know where the kitchen is. The kitchen from which all of these really deadly disease dishes come from is from Iran and you're standing up against this evil monster, who for 46 years has said they're going to destroy you. But then they say once they're finished with you, they come after us. You're the appetizer, we're the entrée. Americans need to understand that the reason it matters what you do is because how you handle this threat is how we will ultimately have to handle this threat. Your enemies are our enemies and I hope it's always true that your friends are our friends. I say this from the bottom of my heart, America is your friend. We're your partner. We will stand with you. We must. We can't afford to pay the alimony of the divorce. So I hope you like us; you're stuck with us and I hope Americans will always love you because we feel like we're stuck with you too. God bless you.” Huckabee emphasized that "we (the US and Israel) are partners, we are not just stakeholders cooperating to advance their own selfish interests. Israel is not just our business partner, we also benefit from Israel's economic strength." He also noted "the strength of the Israeli economy in the midst of war, against all the international pressure, and frankly, against the backdrop of international madness." Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also addressed the strength of relations between the countries: "We believe that the coming period will be a new high in relations between Israel and the US: an economic partnership that will bring more investments and more cooperation, regional moves that will position Israel as a strategic center connecting the Middle East, Europe and Asia, and an ideological infrastructure of a connection between tradition and innovation and freedom." Smotrich noted that Huckabee is "not just an ambassador of a country but a true friend" of Israel. "The Israeli economy has stood a huge test and emerged from it stronger than ever," said Smotrich. "The Israeli shekel is stronger today than on the eve of the war. This is not just the result of market trends - it is an international expression of confidence in the strength of Israeli society, in our political stability, and in the economic policy we are leading. The Israeli stock exchange has provided some of the highest returns in the world, thus proving that despite the war - the future here is bright. Investors understand better than politicians and commentators and they believe in Israel and the fast future that awaits it. And they are right.. The Chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, Seffy Zinger, said that "one of the main factors for the strength of the Israeli capital market is its deep integration with global markets, and especially with the American capital market. The financial ties between us are deep and strong." Zinger recounted a recent meeting in the US with American investors: "What particularly caught their attention was the performance of the Israeli stock exchange compared to global markets. The Tel Aviv-125 index yielded a return of almost 30% in 2024, almost as much as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. This is an especially impressive achievement, given the fact that it took place during the most difficult and complex war in Israel's history. I told those investors: Don't invest in Israel just out of love. Invest in it because it's a good investment." In addition to Smotrich and Zinger, the event was attended by other heads of the economy, including Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Finance Ministry Director General Ilan Rom, Israel Stock Exchange Director General Itai Ben Ze'ev, Competition Authority Director Michal Cohen, Capital Market Authority Commissioner Amit Gal, Bank Leumi CEO Hanan Friedman, Phoenix CEO Eyal Ben Simon, Zvi Stepak, co-owner of the investment house Meitav-Dash, BlackRock Israel CEO Anat Levin, venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg, co-founder of the Aleph Fund, businessman Gideon Tadmor, Bank of Jerusalem CEO Yair Kaplan, and former minister and venture capitalist Yizhar Shai, whose son Yaron Shai fell on October 7, and who decided to leverage the pain to establish 1,500 startups to commemorate those murdered and fallen on October 7 and in the Swords of Iron War. Minister Smotrich said that he came to the event from Mount Herzl, where Yosef Yehuda Chirak, who fell yesterday in Gaza, was laid to rest. He said that Huckabee and he met just two days ago with Yehuda Eliyahu, head of the Settlement Directorate at the Defense Ministry, and Chirak’s father-in-law.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT becomes second-largest Bitcoin holder behind Satoshi Nakamoto

BlackRock's IBIT poised to potentially overtake Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin holdings by next summer. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the second-largest holder of Bitcoin as of May 20, surpassed only by the infamous wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship crypto. According to data compiled by crypto analyst Shaun Edmondson, IBIT currently holds 636,108 BTC, representing over 3% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million and nearly 57% of Nakamoto’s estimated 1.12 million BTC stash. With this, BlackRock now holds more Bitcoin than Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the bellwether asset. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that, depending on how Bitcoin performs in the market, the ETF’s Bitcoin holdings could overtake Satoshi’s by next summer. He added that the timeline could accelerate if the asset’s price approaches $150,000. He said such a surge might prompt widespread institutional demand, particularly from financial advisors reallocating client assets into Bitcoin exposure. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become a dominant player in the Bitcoin ETF space. The fund has consistently outpaced other ETFs in inflows and asset growth, including traditional vehicles such as gold ETFs. Its rise has been fueled by growing demand from institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. According to data from Sosovalue, BlackRock’s IBIT held $66.9 billion in net assets as of May 19, making it the largest Bitcoin ETF by value. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The Significance of Jamie Dimon’s Reluctant Bitcoin Surrender

Time Published: 2025-05-20T18:55:24Z
Full Content:
Correspondent JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon at the Global Markets Conference in Paris on May 15, 2025. Correspondent JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon has long been one of Bitcoin’s most vicious skeptics. In 2017, he said he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin for being “stupid,” and called it a “fraud.” Last year, he called the cryptocurrency a “pet rock.” But this week, Dimon announced that JPMorgan Chase would allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. He said it with a grimace on his face, speaking at JPMorgan Chase’s investor day, and rattled off a list of criticisms shared by other Bitcoin cynics, including that the currency facilitated sex trafficking and terrorism. But he conceded that his clients could do what they wished with their money. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it.” Advertisement Advertisement The decision marks a significant symbolic and practical victory for the Bitcoin community, which, despite its anti-establishment beginnings, has sought institutional acceptance. Dimon, a heavyweight of traditional finance, has consistently used his perch to discourage regular investors and other financial leaders from getting involved. But he has also often been called a pragmatist—and his shift on Bitcoin reflects a changed political climate and mounting client demand. Read More: Why Trump’s Meme Coins Have Alarmed Both Crypto Insiders and Legal Experts Dimon’s decision arises from a year of mounting competition and interest in Bitcoin from other large firms. The entwining of Bitcoin and traditional finance kicked off in January 2024, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly gave the green light for Bitcoin ETFs—investment vehicles which allow people to bet on Bitcoin’s price without actually holding it—to enter the market. Billions of dollars immediately flowed into these ETFs, proving their value to major financial institutions like BlackRock. That summer, Morgan Stanley allowed its wealth advisors to sell Bitcoin ETFs to clients, and Goldman Sachs purchased $418 million worth of them. Then, Donald Trump won the presidency, sending crypto hype into overdrive. On the campaign trail, Trump won over many crypto fans for accusing Biden of choking off the industry. Trump then pledged to make the U.S. the “Bitcoin capital of the world.” Since his election, Trump has thrown both his government influence and personal brand behind cryptocurrency efforts. And the banking sector has been significantly impacted. In his first week in office, Trump repealed SAB 121, a Biden-era accounting rule which discouraged banks from handling crypto assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency then rescinded their anti-crypto guidance, leaving much greater discretion to the banks on how to deal with digital assets. Many banks jumped in. Goldman Sachs amassed a stockpile of over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. The CEOs of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley both expressed interest in offering crypto products. Dimon could have stuck to his guns and kept JPMorgan out of it. But the bank—which is the biggest in America, with over $3 trillion in assets worldwide— risked losing high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking to diversify their portfolios at a moment of extreme financial volatility. So now, JPMorgan customers will be allowed to buy Bitcoin, he said on Monday. He added, however, that the bank would not custody Bitcoin, necessitating a trusted third party. Dimon’s decision could bring about further change. His capitulation could serve as a powerful signal to other holdouts in traditional finance. And JPMorgan’s massive customer base could bring in a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Crypto Twitter, unsurprisingly, gleefully celebrated his about-face. “Jamie Dimon has bent the knee,” Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan, wrote on Twitter. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Title: 3 Terrible Companies To Lose $5 Billion in Federal Green Energy Loans
URL: https://reason.com/2025/05/20/3-terrible-companies-to-lose-5-billion-in-federal-green-energy-loans/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T17:37:59Z

Energy & Environment Jeff Luse | 5.20.2025 1:37 PM In the last days of the Biden administration, the Energy Department dolled out billions of dollars for politically favored green energy projects. The Trump administration is looking to claw this funding back. The Energy Department is getting ready to "cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration," reports Semafor. This action will cancel approximately $5 billion worth of funding for a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company, a loan program for low-income homeowners to install rooftop solar panels by Sunnova, and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia. The remaining four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, which "were already previously cancelled by their companies because of other various headwinds," according to Semafor. The three active projects that will have their federal loans axed have faced their own share of problems. In September 2023, Sunnova received a $3 billion partial loan guarantee from the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) for Project Hestia—a program that would make residential rooftop solar, battery storage, and virtual power plants "available to more American homeowners." Hestia was expected to provide loans to as many as 115,000 homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico for these technologies, while creating "3,400 good-paying, high-quality American jobs." After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova came under fire for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients, which led to subsequent congressional scrutiny. In April, Sunnova began filing for bankruptcy. The company recently said it was no longer planning to use the programming funding and was working with the Energy Department to return the remaining guarantees. Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee from the LPO to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company, which has received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy and was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, creates hydrogen fuel with renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia in fertilizers) and carbon black. Despite the federal funding and private sector support, The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2024 that the company was "running short on cash and facing project delays." The third project facing the ax is New Jersey's Clean Energy Corridor, "a project to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate planned generation in New Jersey to meet growing electricity demand." Run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, the project received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state's goal of "introducing 11,000 MW of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035." When First Energy, which owns Jersey Central, first announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey's coast. The projects were canceled in 2023. Another New Jersey offshore wind project was recently halted after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project's environmental permits. Despite these project cancellations and the LPO's history of questionable and risky investments, it does not appear that the office is going away soon; Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told lawmakers that his agency would use the LPO to advance nuclear energy projects. Assuming Wright fully cuts billions of dollars worth of wasteful projects and narrows the agency's scope to only fund nuclear power projects, it's possible that the LPO's budget—which ballooned to over $400 billion under the Biden administration—could meaningfully shrink. Still, a meaningfully reduced budget is not enough. With the national deficit climbing to over $28 trillion in debt held by the public, taxpayers can no longer afford to support the federal government's fantasy that it should be a green bank.

Title: Noom is offering microdoses of compounded Wegovy for weight loss
URL: https://qz.com/noom-weight-loss-drugs-glp-1-wegovy-alternative-1851781546
Time Published: 2025-05-20T17:13:45Z
Full Content:
Noom will start offering smaller doses of compounded Wegovy (NVO+1.61%), the blockbuster weight-loss drug, as the digital health company continues to adapt to the growing demand for affordable weight-loss solutions and a changing market. Reuters (TRI+0.10%) reported that Noom is rolling out personalized doses of its semaglutide drug to help patients manage their weight while minimizing side effects (such as nausea) that are a common concern with full doses of the drug. Smaller doses can also help patients cut down on costs. Wegovy can cost upward of $349 for a 2.5-milligram vial. Meanwhile, Noom’s compounded semaglutide, offered through a telehealth model, allows patients to access the treatment at a fraction of the cost, starting at $149 for the first month. Taking smaller doses of the medication has become popular due to the drugs’ expense and side effects, but Noom told Reuters that its goal isn’t to capitalize on the microdosing trend but rather to provide a more manageable and effective weight-loss solution, tailored to individual patient needs. In a recent blog post, CEO Geoff Cook wrote that Noom’s GLP-1 RX Program with Smart Dose can address gaps “to provide a personalized, behaviorally integrated approach for patients who need it.” Members who are prescribed a program with Noom’s SmartDose may start at a lower than commercially available dose and move their dosage up at a personalized pace based on individual response. Users will continue to adjust their dose through frequent check-ins to ensure the treatment is working best for them. According to Reuters, Noom’s personalized approach could start with half of the standard 0.25-milligram starter dose of Wegovy and gradually increase to around half of the FDA-approved maximum dose of 2.4 milligrams over a 20-week period. Noom has been offering the SmartDose program to patients clinically indicated since February. The move comes as demand for weight-loss medications such as Wegovy has surged, driven by their ability to help patients potentially lose up to 20% of their body weight. The FDA is moving to rein in unapproved compounded versions of semaglutide-based drugs such as Wegovy. These versions were temporarily permitted during shortages, but that exemption ends May 22. Noom, however, is betting its personalized prescribing model will still comply with FDA rules, which allow compounding for individual patients under specific conditions. “There is a personalized — and there has always been a personalized — exception,” Cook, the company’s CEO, told Reuters. Noom’s bet on smaller doses of its weight-loss drug comes as recent figures suggest the drug market may be seeing signs of slowing growth. Sales of Wegovy reached approximately 17.36 billion Danish kroner (about $2.64 billion) in Q1 2025, reflecting a 19% year-over-year increase — but also a 13% quarter-over-quarter decline, indicating potential signs of market stagnation. And the CEO of Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk just stepped down after the company’s stock dropped 50% in a year. Competition has intensified, with Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.74%) Zepbound and its coming GLP-1 pill adding pressure to the market for weight-loss drugs. Alongside these contenders, compounded alternatives to semaglutide are flooding the market, further complicating the landscape.

Title: Don't call it a comeback: Why Goldman sees the downtrodden Magnificent 7 roaring back to beat the market

The stock market's tech titans stumbled in the first quarter, but 2025 will still be another winning year for the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs said. In a recent note, chief equity strategist David Kostin projected that the mega-cap tech cohort will once again outperform the rest of the S&P 500 in 2025, extending a streak of stellar gains to a third straight year. "We continue to expect that superior earnings growth will drive the Magnificent 7 to outperform the S&P 493 in 2025, but by a smaller magnitude than in recent years," Kostin wrote. "The share price outperformance of the Magnificent 7 has been tied to their earnings growth outperformance." It's a take that might seem contradictory to what's transpired so far this year, as trade policy, AI disruptions, and antitrust moves have muddled the outlook for Big Tech. The group, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, is down 5% year-to-date, trailing the 4% gain achieved by the broader index. Some big banks, such as Morgan Stanley, have called on investors to reduce tech exposure. Ye, despite the slump so far, Kostin noted that mega-cap tech demonstrated earnings outperformance in the first quarter. In 2025, earnings-per-share growth has surged 28% for the Mag Seven, handily outpacing 9% for the S&P 493. "This magnitude of surprise was the largest since the 2Q 2021 reporting season when the Magnificent 7 beat earnings estimates by 27%," the bank wrote. "Partly as a result of strong 1Q results, consensus 2025 earnings estimates for the Magnificent 7 are roughly in line with where they began the year." What's more, the top tech stocks are now trading at a discounted valuation, resulting from narrowing earnings growth compared to previous years. "The relative valuation is the lowest it's been in the last two years," Kostin told Bloomberg TV. "From a starting point of entry, it's actually looking somewhat more attractive at these levels."

Title: Ulta Stock Catches Oppenheimer's Eye Ahead of Earnings Release Next Week

Ulta (ULTA) shares are in the midst of a glow-up. The cosmetic company is attracting attention from investors, with analysts saying consumers are less likely to cut back on beauty purchases during tough economic times. Oppenheimer is one of the latest investment advisory groups to make this case ahead of Ulta’s earnings release slated for next week. Oppenheimer maintained its “outperform” rating of Ulta Tuesday and raised its target price to $465, which is 11% above the average target price among analysts who follow Ulta and were polled by Visible Alpha. Oppenheimer said Ulta appears poised to meet its financial targets and may benefit from limited exposure to tariffs and potential closures of Kohl’s (KSS) stores, which stock products from Sephora, a cosmetics company owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy. “We are encouraged by the strategic direction of the company under new CEO Kecia Steelman and are focused on management's execution of key digital priorities in the coming quarters to sustain the company's competitive position vs. [Amazon] AMZN, [Walmart] WMT, and others,” Oppenheimer said. The cosmetic company’s stock has shot up about 36% since mid-March when better-than-expected earnings and fresh leadership helped reverse a months-long decline. This puts shares at $420.50—or more than 8% above where they were a year ago. Wall Street is looking for a roughly 0.2% year-over-year increase in comparable store sales when Ulta shares its first-quarter results on May 29. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect profit of $267.3 million on net sales of $2.79 billion. A year ago, Ulta reported net income of $313.1 million on sales of $2.73 billion.

Title: This 8% Dividend Taps Into The Real AI Gold Rush

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Orange hologram on black background showing how group of people analise financial data with help of ... More AI Can we still call ourselves contrarians if we buy into “mainstream” trends like the stunning growth of AI? Of course we can. Today we’re going to do just that. But of course we’re not picking up obvious names like NVIDIA (NVDA). Instead we’re looking to an 8%-paying fund I see having even more upside than the “go-to” AI stocks everyone else is buying. The technique we’re going to use here is a very underappreciated concept called “oblique investing.” Sounds a bit dry, I know, but it’s anything but. The idea here is, roughly speaking, to invest in big forces driving the market and shifting the economy over the foreseeable future. Obvious, right? There’s more here, though, because, of course, doing this directly by investing in the trend itself means you’ll likely overpay, since the market has already picked up on it. So instead, we’re going to look to stocks (and funds!) that are well-positioned to ride the trend higher but aren’t the obvious names in their sectors. It’s best to look at this through an example: In the mid-2010s, technology’s rise to dominance over other sectors was a clear trend. So anyone who bought the “big three” semiconductor stocks—NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC)—would have easily beaten the S&P 500 on average. NVDA Total Returns As we can see, big gains from AMD (in blue) and NVIDIA (in purple) more than offset losses on Intel (in green). However, back then, buying NVIDIA, which was best known for making graphics cards for gamers, seemed like a losing move compared to Intel, which made the CPUs in almost every computer. Even Apple (AAPL) had switched to Intel processors. In other words, the “obvious” investment in the future did not play out, while the closely related, but not directly plausible—or “oblique,” if you will—story did play out. Fast-forward to today and we’re looking at another trend in the process of rewriting tech—and many aspects of society as a whole: AI. Here too, NVIDIA is the major player, with its chips powering the AI trend, much like Intel’s chips powered the rise of tech more generally in the 2010s. Thanks first to its gains from powering the tech sector and then to its AI dominance, NVIDIA has grown to become the second-largest stock in the S&P 500. The numbers are staggering: Over the last 10 years, NVIDIA went from being 0.063% of the S&P 500 to 5.8% now. And as I write this, following the tariff selloff, investors are starting to turn back to the story of US economic growth driven by, you guessed it, technology such as AI. And so NVIDIA is starting to recover, but its ceiling is much lower than it was in the past. It’s already risen some 25,000%+ in the last 10 years, and another 25,000%+ gain over the next decade is simply not in the cards. Where does that leave us? Obviously, we want to invest in AI’s ongoing growth, but we don’t want to get into a crowded trade. That brings me to a closed-end fund (CEF) called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO), which we once held in my CEF Insider service. CEFs are, of course, wildly underappreciated, so to say AIO is “oblique” compared to NVIDIA might be the king of understatements! Nonetheless, this 8%-yielding fund (more on the payout in a moment) does hold NVIDIA, so we get some exposure to the company’s ongoing growth (which will continue, even if it doesn’t hit those 25,000% gains of the past). We’re getting the other “usual suspects” in AI, too, including Meta Platforms (META). But the real key to AIO’s “oblique” appeal is that it also holds firms that benefit by using AI in their day-to-day businesses, like drug maker Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), insurer Progressive Corp. (PGR) and heavy-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE). Firms like these are key to profitable AI investing because it’s likely to be the users of this tech—not the providers—that reap the biggest profits from it. While it’s best known for its chatbot, AI leader OpenAI also has many enterprise clients, including John Deere. In short, Deere uses AI to make its products more efficient, such as its herbicide spray, which uses fewer chemicals than competitors’ offerings. That results in healthier, cheaper products, said Justin Rose, Deere’s president of lifecycle solutions, supply management and customer success, in his recent conversation with OpenAI. (If you’re into farming, the entire interview is worth reading.) Of course, these are far from obvious cases of AI integration, so they’re not priced into stocks like Deere yet, and that is exactly why AIO is holding them. Same goes for Progressive using AI to lower its marketing costs and Eli Lilly using AI to discover new drugs. AIO is collecting these “hidden” AI plays for investors to hold for the long haul. Finally, there’s that 8% dividend, which has held steady since AIO’s launch. Investors have picked up a couple of nice special dividends, too. AIO Dividend This, by the way, is yet another benefit of “oblique” CEFs: high (and often monthly paid) dividends you have zero hope of getting from a mainstream tech name like NVIDIA.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Orange hologram on black background showing how group of people analise financial data with help of ... More AI Can we still call ourselves contrarians if we buy into “mainstream” trends like the stunning growth of AI? Of course we can. Today we’re going to do just that. But of course we’re not picking up obvious names like NVIDIA (NVDA). Instead we’re looking to an 8%-paying fund I see having even more upside than the “go-to” AI stocks everyone else is buying. The technique we’re going to use here is a very underappreciated concept called “oblique investing.” Sounds a bit dry, I know, but it’s anything but. The idea here is, roughly speaking, to invest in big forces driving the market and shifting the economy over the foreseeable future. Obvious, right? There’s more here, though, because, of course, doing this directly by investing in the trend itself means you’ll likely overpay, since the market has already picked up on it. So instead, we’re going to look to stocks (and funds!) that are well-positioned to ride the trend higher but aren’t the obvious names in their sectors. It’s best to look at this through an example: In the mid-2010s, technology’s rise to dominance over other sectors was a clear trend. So anyone who bought the “big three” semiconductor stocks—NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC)—would have easily beaten the S&P 500 on average. NVDA Total Returns As we can see, big gains from AMD (in blue) and NVIDIA (in purple) more than offset losses on Intel (in green). However, back then, buying NVIDIA, which was best known for making graphics cards for gamers, seemed like a losing move compared to Intel, which made the CPUs in almost every computer. Even Apple (AAPL) had switched to Intel processors. In other words, the “obvious” investment in the future did not play out, while the closely related, but not directly plausible—or “oblique,” if you will—story did play out. Fast-forward to today and we’re looking at another trend in the process of rewriting tech—and many aspects of society as a whole: AI. Here too, NVIDIA is the major player, with its chips powering the AI trend, much like Intel’s chips powered the rise of tech more generally in the 2010s. Thanks first to its gains from powering the tech sector and then to its AI dominance, NVIDIA has grown to become the second-largest stock in the S&P 500. The numbers are staggering: Over the last 10 years, NVIDIA went from being 0.063% of the S&P 500 to 5.8% now. And as I write this, following the tariff selloff, investors are starting to turn back to the story of US economic growth driven by, you guessed it, technology such as AI. And so NVIDIA is starting to recover, but its ceiling is much lower than it was in the past. It’s already risen some 25,000%+ in the last 10 years, and another 25,000%+ gain over the next decade is simply not in the cards. Where does that leave us? Obviously, we want to invest in AI’s ongoing growth, but we don’t want to get into a crowded trade. That brings me to a closed-end fund (CEF) called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO), which we once held in my CEF Insider service. CEFs are, of course, wildly underappreciated, so to say AIO is “oblique” compared to NVIDIA might be the king of understatements! Nonetheless, this 8%-yielding fund (more on the payout in a moment) does hold NVIDIA, so we get some exposure to the company’s ongoing growth (which will continue, even if it doesn’t hit those 25,000% gains of the past). We’re getting the other “usual suspects” in AI, too, including Meta Platforms (META). But the real key to AIO’s “oblique” appeal is that it also holds firms that benefit by using AI in their day-to-day businesses, like drug maker Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), insurer Progressive Corp. (PGR) and heavy-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE). Firms like these are key to profitable AI investing because it’s likely to be the users of this tech—not the providers—that reap the biggest profits from it. While it’s best known for its chatbot, AI leader OpenAI also has many enterprise clients, including John Deere. In short, Deere uses AI to make its products more efficient, such as its herbicide spray, which uses fewer chemicals than competitors’ offerings. That results in healthier, cheaper products, said Justin Rose, Deere’s president of lifecycle solutions, supply management and customer success, in his recent conversation with OpenAI. (If you’re into farming, the entire interview is worth reading.) Of course, these are far from obvious cases of AI integration, so they’re not priced into stocks like Deere yet, and that is exactly why AIO is holding them. Same goes for Progressive using AI to lower its marketing costs and Eli Lilly using AI to discover new drugs. AIO is collecting these “hidden” AI plays for investors to hold for the long haul. Finally, there’s that 8% dividend, which has held steady since AIO’s launch. Investors have picked up a couple of nice special dividends, too. AIO Dividend This, by the way, is yet another benefit of “oblique” CEFs: high (and often monthly paid) dividends you have zero hope of getting from a mainstream tech name like NVIDIA.

Title: The Travel Stocks Congress Loves to Trade

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Credit: Dozen of lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies. Wikimedia Commons / David Maiolo More than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies — even as they oversee and regulate them. Select a question above or ask something else Members of Congress help shape the future of the travel industry — and some are personally investing in it, too. A Skift analysis of congressional financial disclosures reveals that more than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in airlines, hotel chains, cruise companies, and travel tech firms. In all, federal lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 individual travel industry-related stock trades since the 2021-2022 congressional session, congressional financial records indicate. Taken together, the purchases and sales are worth well into the millions of dollars. Shares of Marriott International, Airbnb, Uber, Hilton Worldwide, and Booking Holdings rank among the most frequently traded common stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Members of Congress are legally allowed to buy and sell individual stocks as long as they don’t violate the anti-insider trading provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK Act. They must disclose their trades within 45 days. Dozens of members of Congress have violated these disclosure rules in the past decade. And a growing number of elected Republicans and Democrats alike want to limit or ban trading individual stocks. Even some of Congress’ most prolific travel stock traders tell Skift that they’re rethinking their investment strategies or have recently stopped trading individual stocks. “The travel and tourism industry is affected by tax implications, subsidies, lots of decisions,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, director of government affairs for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. “Lawmakers can pass a stock ban … they could just invest in broad-based mutual funds right now.” Here is Skift’s company-by-company assessment of which federal lawmakers are trading travel and tourism industry stocks: In all, eight members of Congress disclosed making recent Booking Holdings stock trades within their immediate families, including Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Reps. Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.), Bill Keating (D-Mass.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas). No travel and tourism industry company is more frequently traded by members of Congress than Booking Holdings, the parent company of brands such as Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak and OpenTable. Lawmakers and their spouses bought or sold shares of Booking Holdings at least 85 times during the past four years, according to Skift’s analysis of congressional financial disclosures. In an email to Skift, Elliot Berke, an attorney for McCaul, indicated that the congressman’s wife, Linda Mays McCaul, daughter of Clear Channel Communications founder Lowry Mays, made the trades. “McCaul did not purchase these stocks and had no advanced knowledge of the purchase. Rather, his wife has assets she solely owns, and a third-party manager made the purchase without her direction,” Berke said. Khanna has disclosed more than 50 trades in Booking Holdings that his congressional office attributes to his wife, Ritu Khanna, and their dependent children. The stock’s share price has nearly tripled during the past five years. Khanna has reported thousands of stock trades overall for his wife and children. “Rep. Khanna’s wife’s money is in a trust managed by an independent party, and it’s diversified,” spokesperson Sarah Drory told Skift. “Under official government ethics guidance, diversified trusts eliminate conflicts. The trades in tourism are a part of that trust and are a very small percentage of it. Rep. Khanna and his wife do not trade any stocks. Rep. Khanna has been a leader in calling for a stock ban and is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act and he also introduced a political reform plan that bans stock trading.” As for Harshbarger, she made her Booking Holdings trades in 2022 and has last reported trading any stock at all in 2023, according to federal records. Harshbarger’s final trades from two years ago included shares of Hyatt Hotels — she’s the only federal lawmaker to report recent purchases or sales of Hyatt stock. Marriott International counts Reps. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.), Gottheimer, McCaul, Lee and Khanna among its recent investors. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and the wife of Rick Allen (R-Ga.) also report Marriott stock holdings of $15,001 to $50,000 each, although they haven’t bought or sold shares recently. Marriott is the most popular hotel stock among congressional members, with 67 individual trades. Jackson said he employs a financial adviser and that he wasn’t aware he had purchased between $30,002 and $100,000 worth of Marriott stock during 2023. “I don’t know anything about it,” Jackson said. “I have not directed any trades. My financial adviser stays on it.” Lee, the Nevada Democrat, “is currently in the process of transferring holdings she received following her divorce into ETFs, index funds, and mutual funds, going above and beyond what’s required of her by law and ethics rules,” spokesperson Christopher D’Aloia said in an email. “Representative Lee has never directed an individual stock trade prior to her divorce, and she strongly supports a ban on members of Congress directing trades of individual stocks. Representative Lee had no knowledge of trades made in accounts managed by her ex-husband.” Reps. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), Rob Bresnahan (R-Pa.), Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.), Khanna, Keating, Gottheimer, and Guest each reported Airbnb trades in recent years. Members of Congress and their spouses executed 59 Airbnb stock trades in recent years. Like many of the other companies whose stock members of Congress have traded, Airbnb maintains a strong political presence in Washington, D.C. For example, it spent at least $940,000 each year for the past three years on federal-level government lobbying efforts, according to lobbying records compiled by OpenSecrets. Goldman is among the lawmakers who says he stopped trading individual stocks and is no longer buying and selling shares of Airbnb — or anything else. "As elected representatives endowed with the public trust, members of Congress must uphold the highest ethical standards and avoid even the appearance of a possible conflict of interest,” Goldman confirmed to Skift in an email. “Upon entering Congress, I sold all individual stock holdings and placed my assets into a blind trust to ensure that my constituents can be certain that I represent their interests and their interests alone. It's long past time for Congress to pass a bill banning stock trading by members of Congress and executive branch officials." Gottheimer, for his part, has taken steps to detach himself from travel and other stock trades made on his behalf, spokesperson Tony Wen said. “Prior to taking office, Josh turned over management of his retirement savings and investments to a third party, who has full investment discretion,” Wen said. “Throughout his time in Congress, decisions related to his managed investments have been made at the direction of that third party. Josh is also awaiting approval from Congress of a blind trust. In the meantime, he has taken the extra step of setting up an independent trust.” Wen added that Gottheimer is “working to pass legislation — to ensure that every Member of Congress, judge, or government employee in a policy role, should be required to place any stocks or bonds in a blind trust to ensure they have no direct involvement in their investments.” Members of Congress and their spouses have disclosed executing 37 trades in the hotel company’s stock in recent years. Sens. John Curtis (R-Utah) and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) and Reps. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), Shreve, Khanna, and McCaul are among them. Lawmakers who’ve invested in Boeing include Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), Blake Moore (R-Utah), Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), Julie Johnson (D-Texas), Hern, Keating, Bresnahan, Cisneros, and Shreve. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) also reported holding a Boeing stock investment worth between $15,001 and $50,000 but has not traded the stock recently. The American airplane manufacturer and defense contractor is another popular investment target for congressional lawmakers — 11 of them reported making a combined 21 trades in recent years. Cisneros’ office did not respond to Skift’s requests for comment, but spokesperson Nic Jordan told Fortune in March that the California Democrat has “never abused his official position to benefit a private entity.” Keating, a Democrat from Massachusetts who served on the House Armed Services Committee, sold five-figure investments in Boeing last year — a move that Keating’s office attributed to a financial adviser but that ethics watchdogs criticized, Raw Story reported. Joyce failed to properly disclose Boeing stock trades in violation of the STOCK Act, Newsweek reported last year. Each year since 2008, Boeing has spent at least $11 million on federal-level government lobbying efforts, according to federal records compiled by OpenSecrets. Representatives who’ve traded Uber include Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.), John James (D-Mich.), Michael Guest (R-Miss.), Greg Landsman (D-Ohio), Bresnahan, Cisneros, Johnson, McCaul, Gottheimer, Khanna, and Shreve. Uber is the most popular travel and tourism industry stock in Congress when measured by the number of lawmakers — 11 — who’ve reported trading it during the past four years. Shreve, a freshman, is already one of the most active stock traders in Congress. NOTUS reported this week that Shreve, a member of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, bought or sold shares in several companies that fall within the committee’s jurisdiction. He bought between $15,001 and $50,000 worth of Uber stock on April 7, congressional records indicate. Shreve spokesperson Hannah Benfield declined to answer several of NOTUS’ questions but said in a written statement: “Congressman Shreve relies on a financial advisor to conduct trades. He hired a professional to ensure compliance with all transaction reporting requirements for members of Congress.” Uber is politically active, spending more than $2.6 million in 2024 to lobby the federal government, according to federal lobbying records compiled by OpenSecrets. The company donated $1 million to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, with CEO Dara Khosrowshahi also personally donating $1 million. Uber was among several companies that sent a letter in October 2023 to Comer, then chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, urging him to investigate the practice of third-party litigation funding, arguing that its “negative effects on U.S. civil litigation are manifold.” Comer reported purchasing up to $15,000 worth of Uber shares on Jan. 2, according to a congressional financial filing. Landsman’s Uber trades violated the STOCK Act due to late disclosures. Landsman said last month he would stop trading. Three members of Congress — Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Frankel and Khanna — reported a combined 17 trades in Expedia Group. Lofgren violated the STOCK Act in 2023 when she failed to properly report various stock trades, including her husband’s sale of up to $15,000 worth of Expedia Group stock, Raw Story reported. “All of these transactions, which are related to my husband’s solo practice retirement accounts, are managed by a financial adviser. I do not know about them until they are reported. If there is a late fee owed, it will be paid,” Lofgren said at the time. First-time violators of the STOCK Act’s disclosure provisions are supposed to pay a $200 civil fine, although the House and Senate ethics committees have jurisdiction to waive this fine — and regularly do. Expedia Group’s brands include Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotwire.com, Orbitz, CheapTickets, CarRentals.com and Trivago. Rep. John James (R-Mich.) failed to properly disclose stock trades, including a 2023 purchase of up to $15,000 in Las Vegas Sands shares. It prompted Democrat-supporting political group End Citizens United to file an ethics complaint against the congressman. In a letter to the U.S. House Clerk’s Office, James acknowledged the error, “It is critical to note that there has been no impropriety nor has any impropriety been alleged,” James wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Detroit News. “Regardless, my team and I are committed to providing accurate information quickly and in a transparent, forthright manner. Moreover, I am taking aggressive measures to ensure these types of errors do not occur in the future.” McCaul, Johnson, and Khanna also reported Las Vegas Sands trades, with the four lawmakers combining to disclose nearly 30 trades in the hotel and casino company in all during the past four years. Johnson, the Texas Democrat, is among Congress’ most active stock traders and dumped nearly 80 different stocks on April 1, the day before Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, NOTUS reported. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) and Reps. Lee and Khanna combined to report 15 stock trades in the hotel company. Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), Lee, Cisneros, Moody, Khanna, and Hern combined to make a dozen reported stock trades in the hotel company. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Goldman, and Khanna combined to make 10 trades in the company, a real estate investment trust that has several dozen hotel properties — concentrated along the coasts — in its portfolio. Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines are the most popular stock-trading targets among federal lawmakers. Reps. Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Comer, Cisneros, and Khanna, as well as Sullivan, the senator from Alaska, combined to report 24 trades in recent years. Delta Air Lines has been a trading target for Rep. Morgan McGarvey (D-Ky.), Bresnahan, Shreve, Khanna, Johnson, and Goldman, who combined to make 22 trades. Rep. Tim Moore (R-N.C.) and Khanna reported American Airlines trades, while Khanna and Goldman have traded United Airlines stock. Khanna alone reported trades in Alaska Airlines, while Gottheimer was the only lawmaker to report a trade in Allegiant Air. Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kansas) is the only member of Congress to report a trade in Spirit Airlines, having sold shares in 2022. Prior to swearing off individual stock trading, Goldman also traded shares of foreign carriers Qantas, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, as well as European airplane manufacturer Airbus. No federal lawmaker reported making recent trades of JetBlue, Frontier, SkyWest, or Sun Country Airlines stock. Carnival Corp. is the most popular cruise stock among lawmakers, with seven lawmakers combining to report 25 trades in recent years, including Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Reps. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), Lee, Shreve and Khanna. Meanwhile, Reps. George Whitesides (D-Calif.), Bresnahan, Khanna, and Lee have traded Royal Caribbean stock, while Moody and Khanna have disclosed trades in Norwegian Cruise Lines. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-Md.) alone reported a trade in Viking Holdings, the company that specializes in high-end river cruises. In March, Whitesides sold between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of his Royal Caribbean stock — part of what his congressional office described as “the first of many actions” to “target government corruption” while in office. He also dumped his stake in Virgin Galactic Holdings, where he previously served as the space tourism company’s CEO. “Rep. Whitesides is promoting best practices that he believes every member of Congress should follow to avoid any possible conflict of interest with his future work,” Whitesides spokesperson Natalie Gould said in a statement to OpenSecrets. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has become so known for congressional stock trading that Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) named a stock-ban bill he introduced after her — the “PELOSI Act.” Pelosi does not personally trade stocks, but her husband, Paul Pelosi, makes tens of millions of dollars worth of personal stock and stock option trades each year, according to federal records. She has also expressed skepticism about stock-trade bans. The Pelosis tend to avoid travel and tourism industry stocks, but the California congresswoman did report an investment of between $50,001 and $100,000 in Massachusetts-based Citycar Services LLC, which provides limousine services.

A total of 358,737 applications were received this year—down from over 480,000 last year—making it the lowest since FY22, which saw 308,613 applications. The H-1B visa, long touted as a critical gateway for Indian IT professionals and tech talent globally, is witnessing a decline in demand. Industry analysts attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including: stricter US immigration policies which include the newly introduced “Catch-and-Revoke” policy, which mandates immediate visa cancellation for any foreign national (including those on H-1B, student visas, or other categories) found to have violated any US law even once; a significant hike in visa registration fees; the Trump administration’s “America First” and MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda; and widespread workforce downsizing by global tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. During Trump’s previous tenure, denial rates for H-1B petitions rose sharply due to stricter eligibility criteria, increased site visits, and additional documentation requirements, said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital. Even post his presidency tenure, the lingering effects of these policies, along with the anticipation of a possible return to similar measures, have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. This has made companies wary of investing time and resources in H-1B applications that may face higher chances of rejection or delays, she explained. Further compounding the issue are regulatory and procedural changes to the H-1B registration process. In January, USCIS increased the H-1B visa registration fee from $10 to $215, a move that would impact startups and small firms, which are now more cautious in nominating candidates, shared Mamta Shekhawat, Founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform. Moreover, the shift to beneficiary-driven selection- where each candidate is counted only once regardless of the number of employers petitioning, has effectively curbed duplicate applications and attempts to game the lottery system, she added. The broader slowdown in the IT sector is another major factor. Many tech giants implemented significant staff reductions through FY24 and FY25, impacting hiring pipelines. “As companies tighten budgets, many are prioritising local hiring and internal mobility over international recruitment,” said Sharma. “Employers are being more cautious in their hiring practices, especially when it comes to foreign workers.” Additionally, the rising costs and regulatory complexity of sponsoring H-1B visas have prompted companies to be more selective. As a result, applications are increasingly being filed only for highly specialised roles or project-based needs. Further, the shift to remote work has lessened the immediate need for on-site international talent, says Varun Singh, MD, XIPHIAS Immigration. While the current trend shows a decline, the demand for skilled foreign workers remains high. For FY2026, USCIS received over 343,000 eligible H-1B registrations against a cap of 85,000, indicating sustained interest, shared Singh. However, Sharma noted that the impact of restrictive policies is not limited to H-1B visas. Similar trends are being observed across other work visa categories. “The L-1 and O-1 programs continue to see slower demand due to compliance challenges and cost considerations. Student visas (F-1) remain stable, but changes to related programs like OPT and H-4 EAD are being closely monitored,” she said. Overall, companies are cautious across all work visa categories, with hiring largely focused on immediate needs rather than long-term projections. Looking ahead, the outlook for H-1B visa applications remains uncertain. Sharma cautioned that the downward trend could continue if restrictive policies remain in place. “If the economic climate improves and there’s a shift toward more open immigration policies, we could see a rebound in H-1B applications,” she said.

Title: Why Have Start-Ups With $1B Valuation Still Failed To Disrupt The Automotive Industry?

ByJennifer Jacobs Dungs ByJennifer Jacobs Dungs, Contributor. The modern black sports car ,3d ,render. Yet arguably, it is being disrupted but not from these players. But we will get to that later. The automotive industry is complex, capital-intensive, and highly competitive. It has been a long road to get where we are today. Ford was one of the first automakers in the USA to be formed in 1903, when 12 investors raised $28,000. In Europe, Daimler was formed around the same time in 1890 and sold the first contemporary automobiles, the Mercedes, in 1901. Since then, the Big Three, General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Chrysler), and Ford Motor Company have long dominated as the American car companies. In Germany, the Big Three have been Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. A lot can be said about the positive progress and impact these companies have had on the GDP, job creation, and innovation. But when comparing this to the progress in market capitalization, there is a disconnect. The new kids on the block Shanghai,China-April 3rd 2024: Chinese customers at Xiaomi ev store test SU7 electric car Today the market cap for the USA ‘Big Three’ companies summed together is roughly $112 billion and for the German ‘Big Three’ it is $140 billion. This pales in comparison to the not-so-new newcomer (founded in 2003), Tesla, which has a market cap larger than all of those 6 companies combined, at ~$800 billion (even with the recent turmoil). And has survived the valley of death around ‘scaling’ and impressively sold ~1.8 million vehicles in 2023 (of the 17M global EVs sold). BYD was founded in 1995 and designed and sold their first car in 2005. This, similar to Tesla, is nearly 100 years after the first car companies in Michigan and Germany were formed! Yet, BYD has a market cap of ~$107B, equivalent to more than 2 of the 3 ‘Big Three’ in the USA or Germany. Xiaomi was founded even later, in 2010, focused on smartphone devices, and only in 2021 was Xiaomi automobile founded. They recently just reached their 100,000th unit of their first production vehicle, the SU7. This pales in comparison to the production numbers at Volkswagen, where ~9M vehicles were produced in 2024. Yet Xiaomi has a market cap of nearly 3x that of Volkswagen. Surviving the valley of death How have these new kids on the block survived and apparently thrived, when so many others have not. Starting from the beginning, starting a new automotive OEM is monumental and requires billions – up to $1 billion alone for the vehicle R&D. Production of a new vehicle can cost between $1 billion and $5 billion (e.g., one capable of producing 20,000+ cars annually), tooling can add another $1 billion. This is all before the supply chain, sales and marketing, and working capital. To put it in perspective, new full-scale OEMs would need to raise $10-$20 billion to just join a ticket to the party. And surprisingly – or maybe not so, Tesla did exactly that. It did not hurt that Elon Musk was able to personally invest, he contributed $70 million since 2004 and this helped keep the company afloat during critical times such as the 2008 financial crisis. Turns out this was a good investment, as in November 2024, the shares of Tesla soared again reaching $1 trillion (valued more than Toyota, Ferrari, Porsche, GM, and Ford combined) and continued to increase until January, 2025 – but due to several months of turmoil it has fallen ~32%. And there is uncertainty about the future. Unicorn failure GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - FEBRUARY 26: A Lucid Air Pure fully electric EV car is displayed during the ...

This year’s Show will be a smaller affair with just four major manufacturers confirmed to attend. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) There have been other companies successful in fundraising ~$1 billion, but their success has not followed the same path. Arrival, the British electric vehicle startup, raised over $1.3 billion during its development and was valued at $13 billion before going into bankruptcy. And this all happened before delivering a single electric van. Rivian raised a $1.3 billion round led by T. Rowe Price in 2019 and a $2.5 billion round in 2020, with major backers such as Amazon, Ford, and BlackRock. In total, Rivian raised over $10 billion prior to its IPO in 2021. It has a market cap of ~$13 billion. Recently, it created a joint venture with Volkswagen Group combined with a total investment of $5.8 billion. But in 2024, Rivian sold only ~51,600 vehicles. Lucid raised over $1 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) in 2018, and more recently another $1.75 billion to secure runway for 2025. It has a market cap of ~$7 billion. Yet again in 2024, it sold only ~10,241 vehicles. Adding contrast again, GM sold ~6 million vehicles in 2024 worldwide and in their peak sold 10 million in 2016. It is safe to say that these newcomer OEMs are still in the scaling phase. And there are several other newcomer OEMs who have recently had a stop in the road, filing bankruptcy or are shortly before doing so. This includes companies like Faraday Future, which raised $2 billion since its founding in 2014. It has not formally declared bankruptcy but has consistently struggled with funding shortages and scaling production. Fisker Inc. raised significant funds, including through a SPAC merger in 2020 that brought in approximately $1 billion, but was not able to scale. There are other players such as Canoo, Lordstown Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions, all raising significant cash – but somehow not enough to survive “the death valley curve”. According to Joan Magretta, award-winning contributor to the Harvard Business Review and author, it could be as simple as ensuring the growth ambitions align with the right business model. This makes a lot of sense as the growth ambitions help secure the initial VC funding with a compelling vision and narrative, which led to many companies reaching unicorn status with valuations exceeding $1 billion. But often the start-up underestimates the costs associated with the challenges of scaling an OEM and eventually just runs out of cash. This is the nut that needs to be cracked. Being the fast fish is key to success LEIPZIG, GERMANY - MAY 6: Workers assemble the new all electric Porsche Macan at the Porsche ... More assembly plant on May 6, 2024 in Leipzig, Germany.

(Photo by Jens Schlueter/Getty Images) But there is immense value in helping to ensure that new players do not just come on to the field, but stay to play, and disrupt – as they can help push the boundaries of innovation as shown in the software race and how Chinese newcomers are revolutionizing the customer experience. They can accelerate sustainability as shown with Tesla, which doubled down on an all-electric fleet from day 1. And can increase competition and consumer choice. Mobility is the backbone of economic growth, social connectivity, and sustainable development. It ties together commerce, urbanization, and technology. And this is true both in Europe and the USA with it representing about 14 million jobs and ~7% of the GDP and 10 million jobs and ~3% of GDP, respectively. In order to stay competitive, the Western incumbents have started considering to join forces with the newcomers (as shown with VW Group and Rivian). But this alone will likely not be enough. For newcomers to establish themselves and achieve commercial viability, they need a supportive ecosystem that fosters growth. Access to venture capital funding, state grants, loans, and tax incentives can provide the necessary financial boost. Beyond financial backing, technical expertise is critical. New OEMs must leverage experienced development and manufacturing partners to properly implement their innovations, scale production efficiently and take off into the right direction. Strategic investments from industrial players and tech giants can offer private growth capital that ensures long-term sustainability. It was nearly 10 years ago but couldn’t be more true today as stated by Klaus Schwab, WEF, “… it is not the big fish which eats the small fish, it’s the fast fish which eats the slow fish.” And in the automotive industry, it is time to do what cars do best - speed up!

Title: Irish Life, Amundi and BlackRock picked to run Ireland’s auto enrolment pot

Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), Amundi and BlackRock have been selected to manage assets in the State’s incoming automatic-enrolment pension scheme. It is expected these companies will complete contract negotiations this summer, well in advance of the commencement of the auto-enrolment regime, known as My Future Fund, in January, the Department of Social Protection said in a statement on Tuesday. ILIM had €131 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the end of last year. Amundi is Europe’s largest asset manager, with €2.24 trillion of AUM in December, while BlackRock is the world’s largest, with $11.6 trillion. Amundi has a significant presence in Ireland, with about 380 employees, stemming from its 2017 purchase of Dublin-based Pioneer Investments in 2017. BlackRock opened an office in Dublin, home to one of the world’s largest funds hubs, in 2011, and has subsequently grown its headcount to more than 140 employees. [ Looming launch of auto-enrolment pensions means no honeymoon for incoming ministerOpens in new window ] “My Future Fund is a transformative initiative that will revolutionise how people save for their retirement,” said Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary. “This is a landmark policy and these investment management companies, who have been selected after a competitive procurement process, will play a huge role in ensuring that My Future Fund is a success and represents good value for money for all future participants.” The Department of Social Protection has in recent weeks launched a search for a chief executive of the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa), which will oversee the administration of the AE scheme. AE will capture about 800,000 workers in the State that are not currently part of a pension plan. The appointee to the €215,000-a-year role will be expected to “bring vision, strategic leadership and effective management across all the functions of the Naersa in order to ensure that it discharges its functions efficiently and effectively to the benefit of its estimated 800,000 participants and Irish society more generally,” according to an information booklet for candidates. May 29th has been set as the closing date for applications. The AE scheme is expected it will hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the booklet. First proposed by then government Fianna Fáil minister Séamus Brennan in 2006, AE has been through years of delays and false dawns. However, enabling legislation was finally enacted last July and Indian group Tata Consultancy Services was signed up in October to build and run the AE system. The department is in the middle of procuring three investment managers to handle the assets in the fund. Under the terms of the Irish scheme, which applies to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 per annum across one or more jobs, employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages over 10 years, reaching 6 per cent, 6 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.

Title: Blog: Whatever Happened To 'Working From Home'? Why Your Boss Wants You Back In Office

Time Published: 2025-05-20T13:30:18Z

On Thursday, I had to hop on a video call for a friend's YouTube channel back in India. Without fuss, I set up shop in the echo-chic cafe at my local IKEA. Unlimited coffee, free WiFi and a great background. What more could one ask for? Turns out I am not alone in this lifestyle choice. According to a 2023 survey by office design firm Octra, as many as 62% of UK professionals say they prefer working from places like cafes, libraries and even lush public parks. That's right, more than half of us have ditched cubicles for cappuccinos. As for me, I write a regular column for NDTV and have no office to speak of. I work out of a cosy little cafe tucked inside my apartment complex. The cafe owner is Kurdish, though she looks English, and her waiters are all English, too. If you turned this place into an office, it could easily pass for a UN outpost, as her customers come from every corner of the world. My productivity thrives on the aroma of Arrabiata and crushed cappuccinos. But I envy the next-door neighbours in a gleaming 40-storey tower. They have got a swanky coworking floor complete with WiFi, free-flowing coffee and designer sofas to boot. This is the world I belong to now, and after nearly 30 years boxed into office walls, it feels liberating. It's the same world millions of others turn to when they want to get their office work done, spark a little creativity or just log in to yet another video call. The return-to-office (RTO) vs. work-from-home (WFH) debate is currently tearing through the corporate world - including in India. What was once seen as a pandemic-era workaround - hybrid and remote work - has now become a lifestyle cornerstone for millions of workers around the world. People have grown so comfortable working from home that they have normalised dressing professionally only for the camera - formal on top, pyjama or shorts below. But just when we thought this was the new normal, the suits are staging a comeback. Big names like Amazon, Uber, SAP, JPMorgan Chase and Nike have sounded the bugle. Employees are being called back to the office - sometimes for as many as five full days a week. According to a 2023 survey by KPMG, a whopping 83% of CEOs globally say they expect a full return to in-office work within the next three years. The corporate justification rests on the usual mantras: collaboration, innovation and culture. In India, where the tech sector gamely followed Silicon Valley into work-from-home (WFH), there is growing pressure to follow it right back into the office - just like its Silicon Valley big brother. But the socio-economic implications are wildly different. Remote work helped Indians escape overpriced urban rentals, opened doors for women and gave countless workers a shot at a better work-life balance. Undoing all that could feel like taking away the ladder just as people were halfway up. And what about the gig economy? It thrives on flexibility, but some experts believe it now stands to take a hit if rigid office culture returns. Are we really going to ask a freelance coder in Coimbatore to relocate just to be supervised by someone who still doesn't fully grasp how GitHub works? Having said that, I must add that some Indian firms are navigating the middle path with surprising agility. From tier-2 cities offering coworking hubs to IT majors experimenting with three-day office weeks, there's an effort to make hybrid work culturally and structurally viable. The key, as always, will be to avoid copying Silicon Valley blindly - and instead adapt global trends to local realities. Globally, there appears to be an employee pushback. An SAP manager in Vancouver told this writer that he believes he brings in more moolah for the company working remotely than he would from a cubicle. At his workplace, a hybrid setup has been in place for over a year. "It's there, but it's not enforced with an iron fist - at least not yet. That said, there's a quiet worry in the background: will this suddenly flip into a rigid policy or worse, be used as a pretext for layoffs?" Sure, he admits some roles genuinely benefit from in-person teamwork - think fast-paced brainstorming, creative sessions or problem-solving marathons. But the vast majority of jobs, he says, can be done just as well -- if not better -- from a remote setup. "Personally, I was relieved that the old, rigid office routine was behind me. It offered a more flexible, common-sense approach -- come in when needed, stay home when it makes more sense. It's a win-win that respects both business needs and personal sanity." To be honest, working remotely wasn't exactly a revolutionary idea even before Covid-19 came along. Virtual collaboration was already baked into the system at many companies with footprints in multiple countries. Ask a veteran techie in Bengaluru, and he would tell you that his company's operation ran 24/7 with its teams scattered across time zones. So, working remotely was a necessity, not a luxury. Today, it's a global culture. The tech world was the forerunner, and now, it has engulfed all sectors. Let's look at some facts: 52% of hybrid workers say they're more productive. Another 64% claim it's a better use of their time. And 85% say they're happier doing it. So if you're hitting your targets while also walking your dog, maybe we don't need to panic? Bosses are worried about “fauxductivity” - that quaint buzzword for pretending to work while doing laundry, picking up groceries, etc. And sure, some people are doing household chores and simultaneously dialling into office calls. Research does back some of these concerns: a 2022 study by Microsoft found that 49% of remote workers admitted to doing non-work activities during work hours, like running errands or doing household chores. RTO supporters argue that bringing everyone back to the office ensures fairness, especially for on-site workers in roles that simply can't be done remotely. They also claim it strengthens workplace culture and improves transparency. Fair points. But critics push back, saying that culture isn't brewed in the office kitchen. It's built on trust, purpose and leaders who don't micromanage employees like headmasters. And nothing erodes that trust faster than treating adults like teenagers skipping class. On the flip side, hybrid workers consistently report lower stress levels, with 85% saying flexible arrangements have boosted their job satisfaction. Burnout drops, motivation rises, and people still deliver results - all without the need to badge-swipe or sit in traffic. Still, those advocating for a full return insist that in-person work fosters accountability, clearer communication and a shared sense of purpose. So the question is, if people are meeting or even exceeding their targets, why obsess over where they sit while doing it? RTO mandates aren't just morale-busters for many. They come with a hefty price tag. A UK-wide study from Gensler, the global architecture and design firm, estimates that maintaining office space can cost companies upwards of £7,700 (Rs 8.7 lakh) per employee annually. Add to that the human cost: according to a report by Owl Labs, nearly 40% of remote professionals say they would consider quitting if forced to return to the office full time. And it's not an empty threat. A University of Chicago study found that companies mandating a full RTO saw a significant loss of senior talent. Many seasoned professionals - the institutional memory of any organisation so to speak - opted to jump ship to more flexible employers. This talent drain not only affects productivity but also leaves junior staff without mentors, further hurting long-term performance. The RTO hardliners also ignore one crucial truth, that presenteeism doesn't equal productivity. Just because someone is warming a chair doesn't mean they are contributing meaningfully. In fact, rigid attendance policies often lead to disengagement. Today's workforce craves autonomy - the ability to decide how and where they work best. Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, was quoted in a report saying: "If you micromanage, you won't get productivity gains and you won't attract the next generation." So what's the smarter route? Flexible work structures that prioritise output over optics. Companies that embrace hybrid and remote models tend to save significantly on real estate. That money can be redirected into people-centric initiatives, such as training programmes or wellness initiatives. It could be reinvested in better tech. And hold on, RTO hardliners. Even a halfway decent coffee machine might spark more creativity than those rickety old vending machines that cough up lukewarm sludge in the name of an office. There's a deeper cultural win. When companies trust employees to work on their terms, it builds loyalty. It signals respect. It says: we care more about what you achieve than where you do it from. Of course, flexibility doesn't mean free-for-all. It requires structure, clear expectations and regular communication. It also means designing hybrid systems that allow for meaningful in-person collaboration without turning it into a commute-heavy hamster wheel. Some of the most forward-thinking companies are leading the way here. Airbnb, for instance, allows staff to work from anywhere permanently. Spotify offers a "Work From Anywhere" programme. Remote work isn't a trend; it's a tectonic shift. And while return-to-office policies may work for certain industries or roles, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to stick in the long run. For many of us, the pandemic rewired not just our routines, but our expectations. We discovered new ways to work, live and balance the two. Flexibility is no longer a perk - it's a baseline requirement. In the end, the big irony is that Silicon Valley sold us the dream of working from anywhere - now it wants everyone back at their desks. Well, they have got the dough, they have got the clout, their wishes might just prevail. As for me, I am writing this very column from my favourite cafe, fuelled by Illy coffee and a quiet corner. The work gets done - often more smoothly than it ever did under fluorescent lights and the hum of a tired vending machine. Over to you, dear readers. (Syed Zubair Ahmed is a London-based senior Indian journalist with three decades of experience with the Western media) Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author The problem of Nagaland and the northeastern states stems from an aggressive China that has, over the years, waged a non-conventional war against India directly and indirectly, using Myanmar. While we establish a new normal of military deterrence between India and Pakistan, we seem to have forgotten that our most valuable allies have to be the people themselves.

For its sheer optics, Trump's Gulf tour was quite over the top, with his three hydrocarbon-rich hosts going overboard in offering him mega-deals.

Business A Google logo is seen at a company research facility in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 13, 2025. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo MOUNTAIN VIEW, California :Alphabet's Google said on Tuesday it would put artificial intelligence into the hands of more Web surfers while teasing a $249.99-a-month subscription for its AI power users, its latest effort to fend off growing competition from startups like OpenAI. Google unveiled the plans amid a flurry of demos that included new smart glasses during its annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California, which has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI challenged the tech company's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. On Tuesday, it further laid out a vision for Google Search that lets consumers ask virtually anything, from simple queries to complex research questions, from analyzing what a smartphone camera sees to fetching an event ticket to buy. Google likewise said it aims to build AI that is personal and proactive, whether phoning a store for users or sending students a practice test generated on the fly.

Loading CEO Sundar Pichai said at the conference that Alphabet would build such AI with the cost in mind as well. "Over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point," he said.Google's AI assistant Gemini app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, Pichai said.In a major update, the company said consumers across the United States now can switch Google Search into “AI Mode.” Showcased in March as an experiment open to test users, the feature dispenses with the Web’s standard fare in favor of computer-generated answers for complicated queries.Google also announced an “AI Ultra Plan,” which for $249.99 monthly provides users with higher limits on AI and early access to experimental tools like Project Mariner, an internet browser extension that can automate keystrokes and mouse clicks, and Deep Think, a version of its top-shelf Gemini model that is more capable of reasoning through complicated tasks.The price is comparable to $200 monthly plans from AI model developers OpenAI and Anthropic, underscoring how companies are exploring ways to pay for the exorbitant price tag of AI development. Google's new plan also includes 30 terabytes of cloud storage and an ad-free YouTube subscription.Google already offers other subscription options, including a $19.99-per-month service with access to some AI capabilities unavailable for most free users and cheaper plans with additional cloud storage. Last week, the company told Reuters it had signed up more than 150 million subscribers across those plans.Pichai told reporters that the rise of generative AI was not at the full expense of online search.This “feels very far from a zero-sum moment,” said Pichai. “The kind of use cases we are serving in search is dramatically expanding” because of AI.Alphabet shares closed 1.5 per cent lower at $165.32 on Tuesday. RETURN TO GLASSESGoogle made a return to a bumpy effort years ago around smart glasses, demonstrating frames with its new Android XR software. Since its early efforts, rival Meta Platforms has brought its own glasses with AI to market.On stage, two Google officials had a conversation in different languages while the glasses typed up translations for them, viewed through the frames' lenses.Gemini, meanwhile, answered queries about one of the wearer's surroundings as she walked around Mountain View's Shoreline Amphitheater.An XR headset being developed in partnership with Samsung will launch later this year, an official said. Google also announced new partnerships with glasses designers Warby Parker and Gentle Monster to develop headsets with Android XR.SEARCH PRESSURESEarlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari Web browser for the first time.In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, with one estimate stating it could fall to less than 50 per cent from around 90 per cent in five years. The analysts cited a behavioral shift drawing consumers toward AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines.However, Robby Stein, an executive on the search team, in an interview said allowing users to answer more challenging questions through AI could enable "new opportunities to create hyper-relevant, useful advertising." Ads make up the majority of Google's revenue.Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported.Tuesday's announcements included further updates to Google's work to deliver a "universal AI agent," which can perform tasks on someone’s behalf without additional prompting.In a number of demos, Google drew on capabilities developed in a testing ground it has called Project Astra to show off what its latest AI could do.These included pointing a smartphone camera at a written invitation and having AI add the event to a user’s calendar.Google also presented a new AI model called Veo 3 that generates video and audio to create more realistic film snippets for creators. CEO Sundar Pichai said at the conference that Alphabet would build such AI with the cost in mind as well.

However, Robby Stein, an executive on the search team, in an interview said allowing users to answer more challenging questions through AI could enable "new opportunities to create hyper-relevant, useful advertising." Ads make up the majority of Google's revenue. Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. Tuesday's announcements included further updates to Google's work to deliver a "universal AI agent," which can perform tasks on someone’s behalf without additional prompting. In a number of demos, Google drew on capabilities developed in a testing ground it has called Project Astra to show off what its latest AI could do. These included pointing a smartphone camera at a written invitation and having AI add the event to a user’s calendar. Google also presented a new AI model called Veo 3 that generates video and audio to create more realistic film snippets for creators.

Title: From Dublin bank official to medal-winning gardener at Chelsea: Billy Alexander on turning his side hustle to gold
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/gardening/2025/05/20/from-dublin-bank-official-to-medal-winning-gardener-at-chelsea-billy-alexander-on-turning-his-side-hustle-to-gold/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T12:04:43Z
Full Content:
Billy Alexander of Co Kerry-based Kells Bay House and Gardens knows what it’s like to go from boom to bust to bloom. The former assistant bank manager at AIB was awarded a gold medal for his fern collection at the Chelsea Flower Show, for decades of work with ferns. It his not his first Chelsea rodeo. This is his fourth medal at “the pinnacle of horticulture”, as he puts it. In 2018 he won silver gilt, followed in 2021 by gold for his display of ferns. In 2023, he won gold again, along with Best in Show. “Every rodeo gets better,” he says as he’s interviewed over the phone while selling a €30 specimen to a customer from his Chelsea stand. He’s got a cool head on his shoulders. But rewind more than 20 years ago and the Blackrock, Co Dublin native and former banker used to cycle home from his day job as a banking clerk at AIB bank centre to his house in Leopardstown, where he spent his evenings on his knees becoming a “compulsive gardener”. Tree ferns are his thing. He was first introduced to the plant type by Aunt Cora, a friend of his mother’s who, before she died in her early 50s, became like “a surrogate mother” to the then 20-something. “She bought me a tree fern, a Dicksonia antarctica”. The passion prompted him to start a hobby business selling plants, while not yet giving up on the day job. Alexander encountered Kells Bay for the first time when he drove southwest to deliver some plants to its former owners. The 19th-century hunting lodge overlooks the Iveragh Peninsula and is set on 60 acres of historic subtropical garden. “It was a nirvana of plants,” he recalls. The tree fern forest that sealed the deal. Home to an extraordinary collection of naturalised tree ferns, its oldest specimen of Dicksonia antarctica – known as the garden’s “mother tree fern”, is believed to have single-handedly spored the hundreds of others that now flourish in the protected microclimate of Kells Bay’s primeval forest. Leveraging his three-bed semi in Leopardstown and three apartments he owned, he made an offer of €2 million on the property, first directly to the owners and then through their agent. About a year later they came back to say that they’d accept it, but by then he didn’t have the money. “I don’t have €2 million, but I can give you €1.5 million, he recalls saying. It was accepted. This was 2006. “It wasn’t easy, but it was possible – but impossible now,” he says. After the boom came the bust. He had to deal with vulture funds, but “little by little the dream got better”, he says. [ Best in show: Irish dahlia growers compete in the UKOpens in new window ] He and his wife Penn now work the property together. She’s from Thailand and the resident chef, and B&B costs about €140 to €150 per person. They’re travelling to her native country in October and will visit the area that borders China to see scheffleras, tropical evergreen shrubs, in the wild. Also in his travel plans is a research trip to Uganda to see Lobelia that is native to the Mountains of the Moon Massif. Alexander has also visited Highgrove House, family residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, several times. He had his daughter Aisling with him on the stand when the king presented him with his medal. Even the logistics of the Chelsea show are an enormous undertaking. His stand, in the Grand Pavilion, is 120sq m in size and features more than 100 different species of ferns. Every plant in it was lovingly transported to the London showgrounds by Hutton Transport last week, in a 40-foot temperature-controlled truck. Alexander set the temperature to eight degrees Celsius, to “put the plants to sleep” for the 48-hour journey. He selected 26 of the 50 specimens he grew to be able to make those choices, having nurtured them for two years in advance of this May event. “You need to be able to do quality control, so you need twice the amount,” he explains. He will sell some of his stock, but much of it will make the return journey to west Kerry. And how much does it cost to stage such a show? “It’s sort of like the Olympics,” he says. “They give you a small stipend for your expenses.” The stipend amounts to about £300 (€356). But the actual cost of exhibiting comes close to about €50,000. Alexander’s stand has been sponsored by Wilde Aparthotels.

Title: Tesla EV Battery Supplier CATL's Stock Soars After Largest Listing in 2025

Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, soared more than 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut Tuesday after the Chinese electric vehicle battery maker raised more than $4.5 billion in the world's largest listing this year. The listing comes as Chinese companies are grappling with the effects of the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs, despite recent rollbacks. CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, benefited from investors' faith in the EV boom, and raised 35.51 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.54 billion) from its secondary listing. (The company is already listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in mainland China.) CATL's listing is the world's largest this year, according to Dealogic data, exceeding the $1.75 billion raised by liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter Venture Global (VG) from its January initial public offering or the $1.57 billion by Nvidia-backed (NVDA) AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV). The second-biggest IPO this year was the $3 billion IPO in March by Japan’s JX Advanced Metals, according to the data provider. The company, which is a supplier of EV batteries to companies like Tesla (TSLA), had sold 135 million shares at 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.60) each ahead of its secondary listing. Shares closed Tuesday at HK$306.20. In its prospectus, CATL said that at the end of last year, its "EV batteries were installed in over 17 million vehicles, which represents one in every three EVs worldwide." It said the bulk of the IPO proceeds would go toward funding its plant in Hungary. UPDATE—May 20, 2025: This article has been updated to include data from Dealogic to show it's this year's largest listing.

Title: Nvidia's AI Ecosystem Masterplan Is Driving Its Stock

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia Stock. (Photo Illustration by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have increased by nearly 11% in the last week, and is still up almost 40% over the last 30 days. While wider markets have risen after China and the U.S. declared a 90-day halt on tariffs, which is considered a step toward de-escalating the global trade conflict, there have also been a number of company-specific positives for Nvidia as well. Nvidia has introduced NVLink Fusion, a new interconnect technology for chip-to-chip communications that aims to enhance the capabilities of AI systems. Importantly, the company indicates that it will license this technology to other chip designers, allowing them to develop rapid and high-performing custom AI chips. This enables third-party providers to construct semi-custom AI systems that still integrate with Nvidia’s ecosystem. This strategy broadens Nvidia’s reach within the custom AI hardware sector beyond its own products. Firms like Marvell and MediaTek intend to integrate Fusion into their custom AI system designs. This could be a strategic long-term initiative for Nvidia, as it may encourage companies to commit to its software suite. It could be a move towards Nvidia establishing de facto standards for AI hardware, similar to how Intel influenced the PC sector with its x86 architecture. During President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that the company would deliver over 18,000 Blackwell AI chips to an AI startup based in Saudi Arabia called Humain, for application in its AI data centers. The so-called “sovereign AI” sector, which encompasses government-sponsored projects to establish domestic AI capabilities, is gaining significant importance for Nvidia as it seeks to lessen its dependency on American technological giants. Various companies, including Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, are collectively estimated to make up more than 50% of Nvidia's revenue. Many of these corporations are also working on their own AI chips, making it even more critical for Nvidia to balance its investments. Currently, the rise in NVDA stock over the past four years has been anything but steady, with annual returns being much more erratic than the S&P 500. The stock achieved returns of 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, displays significantly lower volatility. Furthermore, it has consistently surpassed the S&P 500 in the last four years. What accounts for that? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have demonstrated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, providing a smoother ride as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current unpredictable macroeconomic context concerning interest rate reductions and various conflicts, could NVDA find itself facing a similar predicament as in 2022 and underperform the S&P in the coming year, or will it experience a robust upturn? We estimate Nvidia's stock at approximately $101 per share, about 25% lower than the present market value. Explore our evaluation of Nvidia valuation: Is it Overpriced or Underpriced?. Several factors contribute to our current pessimism regarding the stock. We foresee a potential decline in the enthusiasm surrounding AI applications that has driven gains over the past two years, as marginal performance improvements from larger models diminish, alongside challenges in accessing high-quality training data. This transition towards more efficient models could aggravate the effects of a prospective slowdown for GPU manufacturers, including Nvidia. Even though Nvidia stock has been an outstanding performer over recent years, shares can decline rapidly – by 20%, 30%, or even 50% – as has been observed during previous market crashes. No stock is invulnerable. What is the lowest Nvidia stock could fall to in a market collapse? It's beneficial to stay informed.

Title: Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs: Are We Headed For A $120,000 Breakout

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. With Bitcoin (BTC) surging back above the $105,000 mark and nearing its record high set in January, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined bullish predictions for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent post on social media platform X, he detailed the dynamics he believes will drive Bitcoin toward new highs. Since hitting $77,000, Doctor Profit identified $100,000 as the first significant target, which has now been achieved. Looking ahead, he sees the next breakout target between $116,000 and $120,000. His confidence stems from several positive indicators, including a strong bullish divergence observed on the daily chart—a technical signal often associated with forthcoming price increases. He emphasized that daily divergences tend to have a higher success rate than those seen on longer time frames. Additionally, Doctor Profit pointed out that the funding rate is currently stable, with no over-leveraged positions in the market. He noted that BTC recently broke out of a significant double bottom formation and is now testing previous highs. A critical factor in his outlook is the substantial accumulation by US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are reportedly purchasing Bitcoin at a rate eight times greater than its current mining output. This aggressive accumulation phase, according to Doctor Profit, indicates institutional interest remains robust, even as retail traders have largely stayed on the sidelines during recent volatility. The analyst also highlighted that the strongest retail buying occurred around the $90,000 mark, which also represents a liquidity hotspot. Should the market revisit this level, he sees it as an optimal entry point, perfectly positioned at the bottom of the established trading box. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit anticipates volatility, particularly in light of Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating from AAA to AA1—the first major downgrade since S&P’s similar action in 2011. Historical context suggests that such downgrades can lead to swift market corrections. In August 2011, following a downgrade, markets dropped by 5.5% in a single day. Doctor Profit believes that Bitcoin could similarly dip into the $90,000 range to capture liquidity before rebounding. Despite potential short-term fluctuations due to the downgrade, Doctor Profit maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $116,000 to $120,000. He noted that the market had largely priced in the downgrade, and historically, stocks have rallied following such events. With major institutions, including BlackRock, increasing their Bitcoin purchases in the exchange-traded fund arena, Doctor Profit sees no signs of weakness in the market, pointing to further price gains for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,400, marking a 12% increase over the past two weeks and a nearly 24% increase over the past month. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 60%, lagging behind XRP’s gains of over 300% in the same period.

Title: Companies Are Planning to Build Factories In America. Are Trump's Tariffs Working?

Big manufacturing investments are coming to the U.S. as tariffs threaten supply chains and production. Trump has said restoring U.S. manufacturing is one of his primary goals with tariffs. In recent months, several companies have announced they are building new facilities or expanding production in the U.S. as Trump's trade policies have imposed new barriers to imports. Last month, Swiss drugmaker Roche said it was putting $50 billion into expanding its U.S. footprint, though it did not explicitly cite tariffs as the reason. However, Trump has said he is planning to impose a tariff of 25% on all pharmaceutical imports to encourage companies to locate factories in the U.S. Several other pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Novartis (NVS), also said they were spending billions to expand production in the U.S. Other companies that have announced expansions include: On top of that, multiple companies said they were considering expanding U.S.-based production in light of Trump's tariffs. It's still too early to tell if those announcements add up to a manufacturing renaissance spurred by the tariffs.Many manufacturers were already looking to expand U.S. production in an effort to simplify supply lines and avoid a repeat of the logistical headaches of 2020, when COVID-19 shutdowns wreaked havoc on the production and transportation of various goods.In March and before the bulk of tariffs were announced, U.S. companies spent money on building factories at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $234 billion, nearly triple the $79 billion in February 2020, according to the Census Bureau. Economists doubted that the tariffs would result in a large-scale return of manufacturing jobs to the U.S., though many predicted that they could create at least some jobs.Goldman Sachs, for instance, predicted that the tariffs would lead to the creation of about 100,000 new jobs in manufacturing in the U.S. At the same time, however, they estimated the import taxes would cost 500,000 jobs. Tariffs come with some downsides for U.S. manufacturers, even as they protect some companies from foreign competition: firms that import parts or materials pay higher prices, and companies that export products are hurt by foreign retaliation to U.S. trade barriers, for instance.Some companies have already reportedly announced layoffs related to the tariffs, including Mack Trucks and Volvo.

Title: Monzo’s pivot from cool to corporate: ‘freshness is not about gimmicks’

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Monzo, Britain’s biggest digital bank, is still synonymous with its neon debit cards, extensive use of emojis, and free spending abroad. But it’s no longer just trying to be cool; it’s trying to become a major financial institution. That shift, from an upstart fintech beloved by millennials to a mature, sustainable business, is what makes this year a likely turning point. In a sit-down with this editor last week — despite signs that Monzo is preparing to go public, along with new reports that something is in the works — Monzo CEO TS Anil wouldn’t confirm that Monzo is listing this year. He suggested the building blocks are in place, though: profitability, product breadth, and just the right amount of AI. The numbers help tell the story. Monzo posted its first annual profit last year. In its 2024 annual report, it claimed 9.3 million personal account holders and more than 400,000 business customers. It’s also no longer reliant on interchange fees and overdrafts; lending, subscriptions, and business banking are now meaningful revenue streams. All this comes after a period marked by regulatory scrutiny and leadership turnover, developments that forced the company to grow up fast. Under Anil — a banking veteran who joined Monzo in 2020 and soon after took over as CEO from co-founder Tom Blomfield — Monzo is still flashy. Those hot coral cards remain a must for many younger banking customers. It has also become more disciplined about its growing product lineup. Monzo’s customers can now invest in mutual funds powered by BlackRock, for example, and track their existing mortgages from other lenders in their Monzo app. They can also use Monzo in the U.S., though most Americans have yet to hear of the brand. The question is whether that’s a problem, considering Monzo started amassing beta customers in the country six years ago. Certainly, it seemed fair to ask if Monzo needs to penetrate the U.S. market to become the global powerhouse that Anil is envisioning. During our sit-down, Anil suggested that’s not the case. He said that one in five adults in the U.K. now banks with Monzo — in other words, there is market share Monzo has left to gain in its own backyard. (According to Anil, Monzo added 300,000 new users in April alone.) When questioned about U.S. expansion and the competitive landscape, Anil downplayed the challenge. “I think there are a few universal truths that apply,” he said. “Most people feel anxiety about their money, and that anxiety is independent of affluence … The second thing that holds true is that the incumbent industry has been built off of arbitraging customers and leveraging, in some fashion, customers’ ignorance. Those are the insights that are helping us create the best features that would make sense in the U.S.; that’s the way we intend to double down.” During our talk, we also discussed whether Monzo could itself be construed as a legacy player in the not-too-distant future. After all, the company is now 10 years old, and AI is changing everything. We wanted to know whether Monzo worries about the rise of AI-native banks. “Gosh no, we’re not a legacy player,” Anil said. “We continue to operate at the bleeding edge of technology.” What would worry him, he continued, is if he “saw signs of complacency in terms of adopting new technology, or at least a curiosity about it. Those would be like bright, flashing red warning signs for me, but that’s the opposite of the company that we are.” As for the IPO that’s reportedly in the works, Anil said: “To tell someone in the media ‘don’t believe everything you read in the media’ is kind of like a dicey move to make, but yeah, please don’t believe everything you read in the press. We will be a great public company one day. We haven’t decided either when or where, let alone with whom.” If you’re curious to learn more, including about how Monzo keeps its marketing fresh, how it’s using AI, and the ways its engineers handle the adoption of new tech, watch our full chat below.

Title: Bargain butter brings in the crowds

Bicerra By Susan Edmunds and Louise Ternouth of RNZ It was organised chaos this week at Costco when another delivery of butter arrived. This butter is not just any butter - while the other supermarkets are selling a 500g slab for up to $10, Costco's butter is $9.99 for a kilogram. Jody Middleton was among the crowd waiting to stock up on Monday. "I have to say most people were pretty polite about it," she said. "We all knew what we were there for, Costco staff came out and had a chat before they even opened the door, answering questions." She said it was worthwhile braving the crowds. She buys 12 boxes of butter to last her bakery a week. If she bought her butter elsewhere it would have cost more than $800 more. "Compared to Woolworths, it's a saving of $838 for my business in a week." Butter prices have increased significantly over the past year. Stats NZ data showed last week that butter prices were up 65.3 percent in the 12 months to April. Costco butter gets snapped up almost as soon as it arrives on the shelves, and one Taranaki man is making the 750km return trip to get it. Kaleb Halverson decided to start making the trip from New Plymouth to Auckland to deliver Costco's 1kg blocks of butter at $9.99 to customers across the Taranaki region. He only had a few orders at first, but they kept rolling in. 'Butter Boy' Kaleb Halverson loads up on the 1kg blocks on his round trips to Costco in Auckland. Photo: Supplied Halverson makes the trip every few weeks, with the next trip set for May 29, and he told Checkpoint the idea started out as an idea from his mum. "After she made a trip up [to Costco] herself and came back and just thought why not get groceries from there and bring them back for everyone else." He brings back everything the store has to offer, but said butter is definitely top of the list. "It's our hot item at the moment every order has butter." Other popular products are cleaning products and snacks. At the moment he is just servicing the Taranaki region with orders made through his website. Halverson does the orders on top of his full-time job, so the 10-hour round trip is done all on a day off. "We wake up at 4am, pack the car with a bunch of chilly bins, drive up four and a-half hours. "We go and we buy what people have ordered, spend quite a few hours in Costco looking for everything, pack the car and just head back." While he has only done a few trips so far, on the last one he brought back 160 blocks of butter, storing it in chilly bins and chilly bags. Now renting a van, Kaleb said they can do 300 blocks with a limit of 15 blocks per customer and a fee of $2 a block which makes it $12 a kg. He said they were losing out on money on their last trip, so they had upped the service fee from $10 to $40 to cover the cost of petrol and van hire. Halverson told Checkpoint it was still economical for customers to beat the rising cost of supermarket groceries. "It seems to be worth it for people because we've got quite a few orders. "It's unaffordable at the moment just everything here." Kaleb said he would likely have to leave even earlier for his next trip to Costco, as customers were queueing to get their hands on the $9.99 1kg block before the store even opened. Rob Hamlin, a senior lecturer at Otago University, said it was not a price that any retailer supplied by Fonterra could match. Photo: Supplied/John Paul R. Bicerra "The price charged by Costco for packed and processed New Zealand butter at retail is only marginally more than the current price being achieved by Fonterra at auction for its unprocessed milk solids as a bulk unprocessed export commodity." The butter is supplied by Westland Milk Products, which is owned by Yili Group. He said butter was either a "whopping" loss leader for Costco or Yili was trying to undercut the market. Costco declined a request for comment and Westland did not respond. Retail consultant Chris Wilkinson of First Retail Group said Costco knew it had to have a pricing advantage to maintain its value proposition for shoppers. "So achieve that through a pack size that no other retailer offers, and by making a little margin off a lot of volume. "Also, as a global retailer they will be one of the world's largest purchasers of dairy product which will afford them better deals than any Australasian retailer could hope for. They are trading on the world market." He said the pack size was probably not ideal for many households. "And the fact that you still have to spend your $70 to get your membership each year… all these things need to be considered." Chris Schulz, a senior investigative journalist at Consumer NZ, said it looked likely that the Costco butter was a loss leader. "The retailer's Facebook page is flooded with people speculating when the butter might be back on shelves, debating when to visit, and showing off when they do get it. "With butter costing at least $17 per kilo elsewhere else, Costco's pricing makes them look like the 'good guys' in contrast to our supermarket duopoly. Once they're in store, I'm sure many people are picking up roast chickens, cheese, and giant tubs of biscuits too." Fonterra said it could not comment on the pricing models of other retailers and consistent rises in global dairy commodity prices, could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of products like butter and cheese. "We are committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but they may sometimes need to be adjusted to reflect the increased costs." SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER

Title: Eamon Ryan: Why has it taken so long to develop a greenway for Dublin Bay?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/05/20/eamon-ryan-why-has-it-taken-so-long-to-develop-a-greenway-for-dublin-bay/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
For more than 30 years, people have been campaigning for a safe walking and cycling route around Dublin Bay. It could transform our city, connecting northside and southside and restore the environment I grew up in, where children were much more free to wander and explore. It has been championed by many organisations and has a variety of names: the Sutton to Sandycove cycleway, the Coastal Trail or Dublin Bay Greenway. But its history tells a sad story of a lack of political will that is stopping us from fulfilling the true potential of our city. I remember in the mid 1990s heading out to Bull Island on a protest cycle organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign. We were full of hope, only to be frustrated when a local resident opposing the plans had the ear of an influential councillor, and progress was delayed for years. Now the northside section is introduced, I don’t think a single person would want us to go back. Around the same time, we argued with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to compulsory purchase a sliver of land beside Blackrock Dart station to remove one of the worst bottlenecks on the route. We were told it would take too long, and asked to be patient and allow an alternative approach to see the light of day. We are still waiting for that to this day. Fifteen years ago, things changed for the better when, despite budgetary hard times, money was allocated for the first proper greenway between Newport and Achill. It was built quickly and at low cost because local people wanted their children to be able to meet their neighbours without having to navigate the dangerous main road. A few years later, the 46km Waterford greenway became a similar success story and every council started to consider what might be possible. Under the last government, they were allocated the staff and funding to develop their plans. Transport Infrastructure Ireland was given the responsibility of connecting up a national greenway network, and the National Transport Authority had the key role of approving projects and allocating budgets. Their orders were to prioritise local needs, deliver at speed and avoid over-engineering solutions in order to keep costs down. During Covid, the best example came when the mix of a visionary community group, an enthusiastic council and a great local authority official built out the coastal cycle route between Blackrock and Sandycove. They did it in record time and at minimal cost, transforming Dún Laoghaire for the better. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay However, things fell back again when Dublin City Council tried to emulate the same approach in Sandymount, only for the High Court to stop the trial. What made it worse was the chilling effect the decision had in every council across the country and that it took four years for the Court of Appeal to reverse the judicial decision in April. At last, it seemed that the Strand Road section was ready to be built. With Dublin Port also promising a safe route from Clontarf to the East link bridge by next year, an end-to-end Dublin Bay Greenway finally seemed to be at hand. However during the interim period, some Dublin City Councillors appear to have lost their nerve. They and some residents are arguing we should await the introduction of flood protection works before building the cycle path, which will likely delay things for another 20 years. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay – and all that delay because our political system is so attentive to local opposition, while the silent majority opinion that wants change remains by its very nature unheard. Public officials and regulators read the political temperature in a similar way and hold back on making hard decisions. Whatever you do, do nothing, becomes the order of the day. But what happened in Dún Laoghaire shows what is possible. The Dublin authorities are starting to deliver other game changing pathfinder projects and slowly but surely are improving things along the canals, Liffey, Tolka and Dodder. By joining up these various initiatives, we can reach a tipping point where Dublin once again becomes a great city to cycle and walk around and the perfect place to raise a child and call your home. Recent developments in Limerick, where a cycleway will connect the three universities, and on the Waterford Quay – where a sustainable transport bridge is about to be installed, which will link the existing greenway to the Waterford to New Ross greenway – give similar cause for hope. But you cannot force local authorities to make the necessary decisions. However, greater targeting of the active travel budget can change political dynamics. Those councils willing to build with ambition, speed and low-cost solutions should get most of the funding. Those who don’t should be asked to come up with more ambitious greenway plans and a plan to make it happen quickly. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

PR TIMESのご利用について 資料をダウンロード BounceBit Ltd CeDeFiインフラストラクチャ・プラットフォームであるBounceBitは、BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund（BUIDL）を活用した初の構造化利回り戦略を成功裏に実行し、リアルワールド資産（RWA）の暗号資産金融への統合において新たなマイルストーンを打ち立てました。本戦略はBounceBitのトレジャリー管理フレームワークを強化すると同時に、今後リリース予定の製品群「BB Prime」の概念実証として機能します。 このRWA資産を基盤とした初の構造化投資商品では、BUIDL を革新的に活用しています。BUIDL は、BlackRock が運用し総資産20億ドル超を誇るトークン化された短期米国債ファンドです。適格デジタル証券プラットフォームである Securitize を通じてトークン化され、SEC（米国証券取引委員会）規制下のブローカー・ディーラーである Securitize Markets, LLC によって販売されています。投資家は法規制を遵守しながら、ドル建ての利回りを得ることが可能です。 この戦略の中核を担うのが、BUIDL を担保に用いて実行する3カ月間のデルタニュートラル・アービトラージ戦略（BTC先物のベーシス取引とオプション取引）です。本商品の構造では、アービトラージによる年率約20％の利回りと、BUIDL が本来持つ約4.25％の米国債利回りを組み合わせることで、合計で最大約24％の実効APY（年利換算利回り）を実現します。従来のステーブルコイン担保型戦略と比較して、基礎担保の資本効率が大幅に改善される点が大きな特徴です。 本戦略では、以下の点を可能にする新しいアーキテクチャを採用しています。 積み重なる利回りの獲得：米国債とアービトラージ双方のリターンを組み合わせながら、どちらも損なわない設計 機関投資家レベルのリスクモデル：資本効率を最適化 スマートコントラクトの自動化：運用の透明性とオペレーションの完全性を担保 「これにより、従来の金融市場から得られる利回りと暗号資産におけるアービトラージの収益を同時に享受できる初めての機会が生まれました」と、BounceBitの創業者兼CEOであるジャック・ルー（Jack Lu）は述べています。「世界的に著名な資産運用会社と協業することで、CeDeFiインフラによるRWAの活用方法を再構築し、西側基準の資産とアジアのダイナミックなトレーディング環境を結びつけることを目指しています。」 この戦略が成功を収めた背景には、BlackRock が提供する高品質の基盤資産と、Securitize による堅固なコンプライアンス体制があります。BounceBit の CeDeFi スタックは、カストディアンとトレーディング・プラットフォーム間での資産移転をスムーズに実行できるよう設計されています。 今後ローンチ予定の「BounceBit Prime」プラットフォームは、RWA を基盤とした統合型の利回りソリューションの提供を専業で行う初のプラットフォームになります。流動性の制限や実需の乏しさなど、RWA 分野が抱える主要な課題に対応することを目指しています。BlackRock の BUIDL や Franklin Templeton の Benji Fund などが初期のラインアップとして予定されており、450Mドル超のCeDeFiエコシステムによって支えられる BounceBit Prime は、機関投資家や暗号資産ネイティブ投資家に対して透明性と高効率の利回り商品を提供する計画です。ローンチに関する詳細は、近く発表される予定です。 BounceBit についてBounceBit は、CeDeFi（中央集権型と分散型を融合した金融）の中核インフラ構築に取り組んでいます。機関投資家向けの利回り商品、リステーキング・アプリケーション、RWA（リアルワールド資産）統合を提供します。BounceBit Chain は、Bitcoin（BTC）と独自トークン $BB によるデュアルトークン型 PoS Layer1 で運営されており、ビットコイン並みの高いセキュリティとEVM（Ethereum Virtual Machine）との完全互換性を兼ね備えています。 Website : https://www.bouncebit.io/ X (旧Twitter) : https://x.com/bounce_bit すべての画像 このプレスリリース内で使われている画像ファイルがダウンロードできます 0フォロワー Copyright © PR TIMES Corporation All Rights Reserved.

Title: The Perils of Founder Worship
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/05/20/the-perils-of-founder-worship/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T04:05:46Z
Full Content:
In the world of startups, founders are often elevated to near mythical status – the force poised to disrupt entire industries. This adulation can grant founders extraordinary latitude in corporate control, especially in innovative and unregulated sectors like tech or crypto. However, when this reverence turns into “founder worship,” especially under the guise of doing good, it blinds investors and stakeholders to the absence of basic corporate governance. The consequences can be disastrous. The rise and fall of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried (“SBF”) offer a cautionary tale – one where charisma, weak governance, and the veneer of altruism obscured its lack of corporate discipline. It is a stark illustration of what can happen when governance norms are subordinated to a visionary founder. At the heart of the FTX scandal lies a troubling paradox: The “do-gooderism” that made SBF a household name and the darling of the venture capital world also amplified founder exceptionalism and deferred governance in the name of innovation. In essence, FTX highlights the dangerous interplay between founder worship and a specific kind of moral narrative that led to a company operating without fundamental corporate safeguards and meaningful checks on the founder’s authority. The rise of effective altruism (“EA”), a philosophical and social movement that emphasizes evidence-based philanthropy and the strategic use of wealth to maximize social good, permeates elite universities and the tech ecosystem. SBF’s association with EA lent him credibility and moral capital, particularly among sophisticated investors like Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, and Thoma Bravo LP. In theory, EA is aligned with ethical principles – encouraging rich individuals to donate substantial portions of their income to causes that yield the greatest impact. The reality, however, was that EA served as a moral halo for SBF, evidence of his integrity and commitment to the greater good. SBF’s disheveled appearance reinforced the impression that he was intensely focused on building the first one trillion-dollar startup solely for EA goals. This impression created trust in SBF, which substituted for governance. FTX’s legitimacy was bolstered not by its compliance with best practices but by its founder’s supposed noblesse oblige, which was based on his commitment to EA. Venture capital-backed startups operate in a unique legal environment where private ordering allows early-stage companies to structure governance, allocate rights, and implement oversight according to their own preferences. The flexibility accorded to private companies contrasts with the discipline expected of public companies, where ownership and control are clearly separated and heavily regulated. In many ways, this flexibility allows startups to move fast, take risks, and innovate. Over time, oversight mechanisms such as investor board seats, staged financings, and protective provisions typically create checks. However, when a founder commands cultural and financial capital, as did SBF, these checks may be non-existent. Enamored by mission-driven founders, investors sometimes abdicate their responsibility to control and manage the startups through the board of directors and to vote on corporate policies. The promise of massive returns can distract the most seasoned venture capitalists to the extent that they ignore red flags. By deferring or waiving such checks, a company whose corporate governance is based on private ordering can falter or even collapse. In the case of FTX, a founder-centric structure, coupled with mythical “do gooderism,” became a shield against scrutiny and ultimately led to the company’s demise and SBF’s criminal conviction. FTX was not subject to even the most basic corporate controls. Financial audits, effective board oversight, and internal compliance mechanisms were absent. Investors overlooked these red flags based on SBF’s visionary status and mission-driven narrative. The failure was structural. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with believing in a founder’s mission, the law must be agnostic to motives, and governance safeguards must be applied at the appropriate times. As FTX shows, private ordering has its natural limits. Faith in founders is no substitute for the timely implementation of legal guardrails to ensure startups do not engage in crime or fraud. By cloaking SBF in moral credibility, he was allowed to operate with little to no constraints, which ultimately led to the implosion of FTX. To prevent the next FTX, we should tighten the boundaries of private ordering. There are several reforms worth considering: It is tempting to dismiss FTX and SBF as anomalies in an otherwise functional private ordering system. But the conditions that enabled FTX’s meteoric rise and precipitous fall are embedded in the culture of venture-backed startups where there is a bias toward disruption over discipline. Startups cannot be allowed to circumvent legal norms just because they are mission-driven. Founder worship should not override the legal structures that protect investors, employees, and the public. The FTX saga underscores that private ordering has limits. Ultimately, its success depends on the timely implementation of corporate governance measures to ensure legal accountability.

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL To Power BounceBit’s New RWA Yield Strategy Platform

Full Content:
Financial infrastructure firm BounceBit is tapping into BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) for a new real-world assets (RWA) yield strategy tool. According to a new press release from BounceBit, the collaboration mixes traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure, allowing investors to leverage traditional yields with crypto derivatives trading. Per the announcement, the strategy involves executing Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin trades with BUIDL as collateral. BounceBit says the trading strategy could raise total annual percentage yield (APY) for investors by 24%. BUIDL is a BlackRock private fund, which is tokenized by Securitize and made available through its Securitize Markets. According to a post to the social media platform X, the strategy is “the first active use-case for tokenized treasuries.” Says Jack Lu, Founder & CEO at BounceBit, “This innovative approach demonstrates what is possible when investors simultaneously capture both U.S. dollar yields and funding rate arbitrage returns, potentially creating opportunities for institutional investors seeking sustainable USD-denominated yield generation across market cycles.” Last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said that the tokenization of RWAs on blockchains will develop stronger links between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi).

NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”"They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he’s not talking about Bitcoin. Just released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers "Most Likely for Early Price Pops." Since 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +23.0% per year. So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention.

May 19, 2025 16:11 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares announced today that it will close and liquidate the following ETF: On May 09, 2025, the board of GraniteShares ETF Trust approved the liquidation of the GraniteShares 1x Short AMD Daily ETF (the “ETF”). The last day of trading for the ETF on NASDAQ Stock Market will be June 20, 2025. The last day creation orders will be accepted for the ETF will be June 18, 2025. Investors may sell their shares of the ETF until market close on June 20, 2025. Shares of the ETF will no longer trade on NASDAQ Stock Market after market close on June 20, 2025, and will be subsequently delisted. The final distribution to shareholders of the ETF is expected to occur on or about June 23, 2025. When the ETF commences the liquidation of its portfolio, it may hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the ETF’s investment objectives and strategies. At the time the liquidation of the ETF is complete, the ETF shares will be individually redeemed. For shareholders that still hold shares of the ETF as of June 20, 2025, shares will be automatically redeemed for cash at the net asset value as of close of business on that date, which will reflect the costs of closing the ETF. Shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss on the redemptions. The ETF may or may not pay one or more dividends or other distributions prior to or along with the redemption payments. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares will continue to offer the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: Contact Information:William Rhind, CEO GraniteShares Inc +1 646 876 5049 william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price.

The last day of trading for the ETF on NASDAQ Stock Market will be June 20, 2025. The last day creation orders will be accepted for the ETF will be June 18, 2025. Investors may sell their shares of the ETF until market close on June 20, 2025. Shares of the ETF will no longer trade on NASDAQ Stock Market after market close on June 20, 2025, and will be subsequently delisted. The final distribution to shareholders of the ETF is expected to occur on or about June 23, 2025. When the ETF commences the liquidation of its portfolio, it may hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the ETF’s investment objectives and strategies. At the time the liquidation of the ETF is complete, the ETF shares will be individually redeemed. For shareholders that still hold shares of the ETF as of June 20, 2025, shares will be automatically redeemed for cash at the net asset value as of close of business on that date, which will reflect the costs of closing the ETF. Shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss on the redemptions. The ETF may or may not pay one or more dividends or other distributions prior to or along with the redemption payments. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares will continue to offer the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: Contact Information:William Rhind, CEO GraniteShares Inc +1 646 876 5049 william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”"They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he’s not talking about Bitcoin. Just released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers "Most Likely for Early Price Pops." Since 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +23.0% per year. So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention.

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump’s Attacks

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon revealed the bank will offer Bitcoin, but he is still "not a fan" of the flagship cryptocurrency. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the Wall Street lender plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC) to its customers in a stark shift from his historical stance toward the digital asset. During JPMorgan’s Investor Day, Dimon reiterated that he is “not a fan” of Bitcoin, but acknowledged that clients will continue to demand access to it. He said: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” He also clarified that the bank does not plan on offering custody services. Dimon’s criticism of crypto is consistent with past remarks. In a January interview, he called Bitcoin “worthless.” He tied it to criminal activity, repeating concerns raised in his 2023 Senate testimony, in which he advocated for shutting down the industry altogether. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, he referred to Bitcoin as a “pet rock,” while in April of the same year, Dimon called crypto a “Ponzi Scheme.” In his May 19 remarks, he also stated that “blockchain doesn’t matter as much” as people think. However, JPMorgan has continued to build infrastructure around blockchain technology for institutional use. Earlier this month, Kinexys completed a test transaction that bridged its private network to a public layer-1 blockchain, using tokenized short-term Treasury assets and real-time settlement protocols. Chainlink and Ondo Finance participated in this pilot. Additionally, Kinexys processes over $2 billion in transactions daily and plans to scale up dollar-euro settlements using JPM Coin, JPMorgan’s proprietary token. Amid the remarks on Bitcoin offering, JPMorgan’s 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the first quarter of 2025 showed a dramatic increase in crypto exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of March 31, the firm reported $16.3 million in crypto-related holdings, up from $1 million at the end of 2024. The lender’s crypto exposure is primarily via Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked instruments. As of March 31, JPMorgan held a little over 263,000 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and around 3000 shares of Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB). The lender also held shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Mini Trust ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and new allocations to Bitwise and Franklin Templeton Ethereum products. The firm’s crypto-related holdings are just a tiny fraction of its $4.4 trillion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter. It’s unclear how much of the portfolio reflects proprietary positioning versus facilitation of client demand. The bank has previously clarified that holding some ETF allocations could be a part of its market-making services.

Title: Market Expert Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $220,000 By Year End If This Happens

Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to show strength following a resilient recovery from its April lows. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $104,921. Notably, after dipping below $80,000 amid heightened U.S.-China tariff tensions, Bitcoin rebounded strongly, gaining approximately 25% in April alone before a further surge this month. Renewed institutional interest has bolstered this upward momentum, including significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. That said, in this bullish environment, market analyst “apsk32” has projected that Bitcoin could reach $220,000 by the end of 2025 if its historical correlation with gold remains intact. In a recent tweet, the pundit argued that Bitcoin’s price movements continue to reflect long-term patterns tied to gold, not fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which he claims distorts BTC’s real value due to inflation. “The peg to fiat hides the truth,” he stated, citing a valuation model that prices Bitcoin in ounces of gold rather than dollars. The model uses a power-law function, a mathematical formula that accounts for Bitcoin’s cyclical nature. According to the analyst, Bitcoin currently represents over 643 million ounces of gold in market capitalization. This relationship, he suggested, puts the digital asset on track to match or exceed $220,000 in the coming months, assuming gold’s rally continues and Bitcoin maintains its historical pattern of lagging gold’s movements by a few months. Notably, Gold recently reached a record price of $3,500 per ounce, forming what the analyst describes as a “very bright” backdrop for Bitcoin. Although a theoretical top of $444,000 is possible based on this model, the analyst noted he believes $220,000 is a more realistic ceiling for 2025. But the journey to that target is not without obstacles. Market data shows a significant liquidity barrier between $105,000 and $110,000, where large sell orders could suppress upward momentum. Key support is seen at around $98,000 to $100,000, a level some analysts call “critical” for sustaining the uptrend. Elsewhere, Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto trader and founder of MN Trading, echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin needs to hold above $98,000 to continue its bullish momentum. “It’s the last major consolidation before the breakout,” he said. Meanwhile, other prominent voices have weighed in with similar bullish predictions. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, doubled down on his support for Bitcoin, calling it a hedge against a collapsing central banking system. “I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250K this year. Buy more. Do not sell,” he urged his followers on Saturday However, not all indicators point to a smooth ride. According to crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s short-term correlation to gold has recently dropped to -0.54, its lowest since February, implying that in the short run, BTC and gold are currently moving in opposite directions. Still, long-term correlations remain intact, with 90-day and 365-day values at 0.39 and 0.60, respectively.

Title: 'Deeply painful': Nvidia CEO says a new chip ban has cost it $15 billion

President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war has cost Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) $15 billion in business, the company’s CEO said Monday. Jensen Huang made the comments during an interview with tech analyst Ben Thompson at the Computex trade show in Taipei. He said that America’s restrictions against exporting its H20 chips in China has had an unprecedented impact on the firm. “We’ve written off — I think it’s $5.5 billion. No company in history has ever written off that much inventory, so this additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said. He continued: It’s “enormously costly. Not only am I losing $5.5 billion, we wrote off $5.5 billion, we walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably — what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes.” Nvidia designed the H20 chip to comply with the Biden administration’s export rules. But those rules became even stricter under Trump and barred Nvidia from selling the chips in China, even after the company pared down their capabilities. While this is the first time Huang has cited a dollar amount publicly, it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. Wall Street analysts had estimated that Nvidia would suffer a hit of between $10 and $16 billion as a result of the ban. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chipmaker with a market capitalization of about $3.3 trillion. But its stock is down 2.1% so far this year amid the ongoing trade war. Meanwhile, while the U.S. limits its tech exports to the country, Chinese tech firms have put renewed focus on manufacturing chips in-house. Xiaomi said Monday thatit will invest at least $6.9 billion over the next decade to develop its own chips. In April, Huawei announced that it was getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia. Beijing has slammed the U.S. approach and Trump’s attempts to pressure other countries to cut their own trade with China. Earlier this month, China’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposes any trade agreements between the U.S. and third-party countries “at the expense of China,” framing the moves as aggressive rather than defensive. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: AI and Work (Some Predictions)
URL: https://calnewport.com/ai-and-work-some-predictions/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T17:41:52Z
Full Content:
One of the main topics of this newsletter is the quest to cultivate sustainable and meaningful work in a digital age. Given this objective, it’s hard to avoid confronting the furiously disruptive potentials of AI. I’ve been spending a lot time in recent years, in my roles as a digital theorist and technology journalist, researching and writing about this topic, so it occurred to me that it might be useful to capture in one place all of my current thoughts about the intersection of AI and work. The obvious caveat applies: these predictions will shift — perhaps even substantially — as this inherently unpredictable sector continues to evolve. But here’s my current best stab at what’s going on now, what’s coming soon, and what’s likely just hype. Let’s get to it… When generative AI made its show-stopping debut a few years ago, the smart money was on text production becoming the first killer app. For example, business users, it was thought, would soon outsource much of the tedious communication that makes up their day — meeting summaries, email, reports — into AI tools. A fair amount of this is happening, especially when it comes to lengthy utilitarian communication where the quality doesn’t matter much. I recently attended a men’s retreat, for example, and it was clear that the organizer had used ChatGPT to create the final email summarizing the weekend schedule. And why not? It got the job done and saved some time. It’s becoming increasingly clear, however, that for most people the act of writing in their daily lives isn’t a major problem that needs to be solved, which is capping the predicted ubiquity of this use case. (A survey of internet users found that only around 5.4% had used ChatGPT to help write emails and letters. And this includes the many who maybe experimented with this capability once or twice before moving on.) The application that has instead leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability, even if it’s not as sexy as creating AGI or automating all of knowledge work (more on these applications later). The other major success story for generative AI at the moment is computer programming. Individuals with only rudimentary knowledge of programming languages can now produce usable prototypes of simple applications using tools like ChatGPT, and somewhat more advanced projects with AI-enhanced agent-style helpers like Roo Code. This can be really useful for quickly creating tools for personal use or seeking to create a proof-of-concept for a future product. The tech incubator Y Combinator, for example, made waves when they reported that a quarter of the start-ups in their Winter 2025 batch generated 95% or more of their product’s codebases using AI. How far can this automated coding take us? An academic computer scientist named Judah Diament recently went viral for noting that the ability for novice users to create simple applications isn’t new. There have been systems dedicated to this purpose for over four decades, from HyperCard to VisualBasic to Flash. As he elaborates: “And, of course, they all broke down when anything slightly complicated or unusual needs to be done (as required by every real, financially viable software product or service).” This observation created major backlash — as does most expressions of AI skepticism these days — but Diament isn’t wrong. Despite recent hyperbolic statements by tech leaders, many professional programmers aren’t particularly worried that their jobs can be replicated by language model queries, as so much of what they do is experience-based architecture design and debugging, which are unrelated skills for which we currently have no viable AI solution. Software developers do, however, use AI heavily: not to produce their code from scratch, but instead as helper utilities. Tools like GitHub’s Copilot are integrated directly into the environments in which these developers already work, and make it much simpler to look up obscure library or AI calls, or spit out tedious boilerplate code. The productivity gains here are notable. Programming without help from AI is rapidly becoming increasingly rare. Language model-based AI systems can respond to prompts in pretty amazing ways. But if we focus only on outputs, we underestimate another major source of these models’ value: their ability to understand human language. This so-called natural language processing ability is poised to transform how we use software. There is a push at the moment, for example, led by Microsoft and its Copilot product (not to be confused with GitHub Copilot), to use AI models to provide natural language interfaces to popular software. Instead of learning complicated sequences of clicks and settings to accomplish a task in these programs, you’ll be able to simply ask for what you need; e.g., “Hey Copilot, can you remove all rows from this spreadsheet where the dollar amount in column C is less than $10 dollars then sort everything that remains by the names in Column A? Also, the font is too small, make it somewhat larger.” Enabling novice users to access to expert-level features in existing software will aggregate into huge productivity gains. As a bonus, the models required to understand these commands don’t have to be nearly as massive and complicated as the current cutting-edge models that the big AI companies use to show off their technology. Indeed, they might be small enough to run locally on devices, making them vastly cheaper and more efficient to operate. Don’t sleep on this use case. Like smart search, it’s also not as sexy as AGI or full automation, but I’m increasingly convinced that within the next half-decade or so, informally-articulated commands are going to emerge as one of the dominate interfaces to the world of computation. One of the more attention-catching storylines surrounding AI at the moment is the imminent arrival of so-called agents which will automate more and more of our daily work, especially in the knowledge sectors once believed to be immune from machine encroachment. Recent reports imply that agents are a major part of OpenAI’s revenue strategy for the near future. The company imagines business customers paying up to $20,000 a month for access to specialized bots that can perform key professional tasks. It’s the projection of this trend that led Elon Musk to recently quip: “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job. But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.” But progress in creating these agents has recently slowed. To understand why requires a brief snapshot of the current state of generative AI technology… Not long ago, there was a belief in so-called scaling laws that argued, roughly speaking, that as you continued to increase the size of language models, their abilities would continue to rapidly increase. For a while this proved true: GPT-2 was much better than the original GPT, GPT-3 was much better than GPT-2, and GPT-4 was a big improvement on GPT-3. The hope was that by continuing to scale these models, you’d eventually get to a system so smart and capable that it would achieve something like AGI, and could be used as the foundation for software agents to automate basically any conceivable task. More recently, however, these scaling laws have begun to falter. Companies continue to invest massive amounts of capital in building bigger models, trained on ever-more GPUs crunching ever-larger data sets, but the performance of these models stopped leaping forward as much as they had in the past. This is why the long-anticipated GPT-5 has not yet been released, and why, just last week, Meta announced they were delaying the release of their newest, biggest model, as its capabilities were deemed insufficiently better than its predecessor. In response to the collapse of the scaling laws, the industry has increasingly turned its attention in another direction: tuning existing models using reinforcement learning. Say, for example, you want to make a model that is particularly good at math. You pay a bunch of math PhDs $100 an hour to come up with a lot of math problems with step-by-step solutions. You then take an existing model, like GPT-4, and feed it these problems one-by-one, using reinforcement learning techniques to tell it exactly where it’s getting certain steps in its answers right or wrong. Over time, this tuned model will get better at solving this specific type of problem. This technique is why OpenAI is now releasing multiple, confusingly-named models, each seemingly optimized for different specialties. These are the result of distinct tunings. They would have preferred, of course, to simply produce a GPT-5 model that could do well on all of these tasks, but that hasn’t worked out as they hoped. This tuning approach will continue to develop interesting tools, but it will be much more piecemeal and hit-or-miss than what was anticipated when we still believed in scaling laws. Part of the difficulty is that this approach depends on finding the right data for each task you want to tackle. Certain problems, like math, computer programming, and logical reasoning, are well-suited for tuning as they can be described by pairs of prompts and correct answers. But this is not the case for many other business activities, which can be esoteric and bespoke to a given context. This means many useful activities will remain un-automatable by language model agents into the foreseeable future. I once said that the real Turing Test for our current age is an AI system that can successfully empty my email inbox, a goal that requires the mastery of any number of complicated tasks. Unfortunately for all of us, this is not a test we’re poised to see passed any time soon. The Free Press recently published an article titled “AI Will Change What it Means to Be Human. Are We Ready?”. It summarized a common sentiment that has been feverishly promoted by Silicon Valley in recent years: that AI is on the cusp of changing everything in unfathomably disruptive ways. As the article argues: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asserted in a recent talk that GPT-5 will be smarter than all of us. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei described the powerful AI systems to come as “a country of geniuses in a data center.” These are not radical predictions. They are nearly here. But here’s the thing: these are radical predictions. Many companies tried to build the equivalent of the proposed GPT-5 and found that continuing to scale up the size of their models isn’t yielding the desired results. As described above, they’re left tuning the models they already have for specific tasks that are well-described by synthetic data sets. This can produce cool demos and products, but it’s not a route to a singular “genius” system that’s smarter than humans in some general sense. Indeed, if you look closer at the rhetoric of the AI prophets in recent months, you’ll see a creeping awareness that, in a post-scaling law world, they no longer have a convincing story for how their predictions will manifest. A recent Nick Bostrom video, for example, which (true to character) predicts Superintelligence might happen in less than two years (!), adds the caveat that this outcome will require key “unlocks” from the industry, which is code for we don’t know how to build systems that achieve this goal, but, hey, maybe someone will figure it out! (The AI centrist Gary Marcus subsequently mocked Bostrom by tweeting: “for all we know, we could be just one unlock and 3-6 weeks away from levitation, interstellar travel, immortality, or room temperature superconductors, or perhaps even all four!”) Similarly, if you look closer at AI 2027, the splashy new doomsday manifesto which argues that AI might eliminate humanity as early as 2030, you won’t find a specific account of what type of system might be capable of such feats of tyrannical brilliance. The authors instead sidestep the issue by claiming that within the next year or so, the language models we’re tuning to solve computer programming tasks will somehow come up with, on their own, code that implements breakthrough new AI technology that mere humans cannot understand. This is an incredible claim. (What sort of synthetic data set do they imagine being able to train a language model to crack the secrets of human-level intelligence?) It’s the technological equivalent of looking at the Wright Brother’s Flyer in 1903 and thinking, “well, if they could figure this out so quickly, we should have space travel cracked by the end of the decade.” The current energized narratives around AGI and Superintelligence seem to be fueled by a convergence of three factors: (1) the fact that scaling laws did apply for the first few generations of language models, making it easy and logical to imagine them continuing to apply up the exponential curve of capabilities in the years ahead; (2) demos of models tuned to do well on specific written tests, which we tend to intuitively associate with intelligence; and (3) tech leaders pounding furiously on the drums of sensationalism, knowing they’re rarely held to account on their predictions. But here’s the reality: We are not currently on a trajectory to genius systems. We might figure this out in the future, but the “unlocks” required will be sufficiently numerous and slow to master that we’ll likely have plenty of clear signals and warning along the way. So, we’re not out of the woods on these issues, but at the same time, humanity is not going to be eliminated by the machines in 2030 either. In the meantime, the breakthroughs that are happening, especially in the world of work, should be both exciting and worrisome enough on their own for now. Let’s grapple with those first. #### For more of my thoughts on AI, check out my New Yorker archive and my podcast (in recent months, I often discuss AI in the third act of the show). For more on my thoughts on technology and work more generally, check out my recent books on the topic: Slow Productivity, A World Without Email, and Deep Work. I agree with natural language commands to be an awesome use-case that people are sleeping on! I have two examples of messing around with ai where I realized if they just got a little bit better at this, it would change everything. First, ai can already identify information in photos. I uploaded a picture of myself to ChatGPT and it started describing how I look. That was a neat trick. But once you can upload screenshots and it can read, transcribe, or act on every piece of information in the photo? Hey here is a screenshot of my spreadsheet, tell me how to fix it. Hey here is a screenshot of a web design that I like, please convert it into code for me. Second, using Cursor.ai IDE, I can ask the agents how to use the program and where things are in the program and of course it can write code, save files, delete files, make directories, prompt commands, and be a search engine all in one. I didn’t know where some of the stuff in the program was and it just told me where it was. I didn’t know how everything worked in the program and it just told me how it works. And then of course it also codes and makes commands for everything I ask. So imagine a future where in every single program you use on the computer, you can quickly screenshot it and ask how to do something or how to fix something and it tells you exactly how to do it, or just does it for you. Now I feel like all the talk about real agents is kind of hyped up? Like just because my IDE can do IDE tasks for me people seem to think agents are going to do my taxes for me and answer all my emails for me automatically. But I think that’s kind of just a dream. “Agent” seems to just be the new term for a long complicated process that had been automated. But I bet instead of the “agent” figuring all that out for itself, it’s going to happen the old fashioned way, where a bunch of engineers work very hard to automate a task. You know, like we’ve been doing for decades already. The photo analysis example is a great one. I think of that as part of the general idea of a super search, where now, the sources for its answer isn’t just the web, but also other things, like photos, or files on your local machine, etc. Sort of like a Google for everything which is, it seems to me, likely where the bulk of the money is actually waiting in the AI race. I agree that superintelligence in 2030 is very unlikely, and it’s good to communicate that. But I think superintelligence in 2040 is totally in the territory of “maybe, maybe not, who knows”, and by not emphasizing or mentioning that, you’re burying the lede. Anything that humans, and groups of humans, and societies of humans, can do, can also be done by code running on chips. After all, the human brain is a machine that runs an algorithm. No one knows the algorithm, but as soon as someone figures it out, they could run it on chips, like any other algorithm. Then we’d get AIs that can autonomously found and run billion-dollar companies, that can invent science and technology and language from scratch, and all the other crazy sci-fi-sounding stuff. And there could be hundreds of millions of such AIs, thinking much faster than humans, etc. Why do I say that “superintelligence by 2040” is in “maybe, maybe not, who knows” territory? Well, LLMs didn’t exist as recently as 2018. The entirety of deep learning was a backwater as recently as 2012. You can say that LLMs are not on the path to superintelligence, and as it happens, I’ll agree with you. But 15 years is evidently more than enough time for the AI research community to have pivoted to something entirely different and poured billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of person-years, into polishing and optimizing it. As an analogy, suppose a giant fleet of alien ships were definitely due to arrive on Earth at some point, but we didn’t know when, and 15-40 years seemed like a reasonable guess. But some people were going around saying the aliens would definitely arrive in <5 years. Then it would be good to correct those people! But it would be bad to imply that therefore we shouldn’t be thinking about and preparing for the alien invasion right now. The death of Moore’s Law (measuring transistors) was the birth of LLM scaling / virtual quantity (measuring virtual parameters). The death of LLM scaling / virtual quantity will be virtual quality. The manifestation of the thing that is manifesting has been going on for 70+ years and there have been dozens of barriers that were said to be impassible, but the manifestation has always found a new thing. Now that the manifestation has manifested the ability to create PhD’s out of thin air to work for its manifestation, now is when you are going to doubt it ?? Humanity is a small thing, and the physical universe is a shallow one. Now some wave from a bigger pond is washing into ours. Sadhguru has a nice take on this current affair https://youtu.be/uGwKU1jaDsY?si=J29PtlB8BuB8iTnx&t=2525 What I am most anxious to see play out is how the next generation of youth engage with Ai tools. The kids who are under 12 today, how will they perform in a world of automation having never known anything other than Ai ubiquity? As a parallel example, take social media. When Facebook launched, a generation of Xennials and first-wave Millennials initially used it as a tool to complement their pre-existing social lives (think wall posts and group events). In other words, when a generation of people with pre-established social skills adopt a new comms tech/device, they see it as complementary to their social world. They lived through the transition. It’s not until later that we see Gen Z struggling with social media, struggling to establish social skills through the devices and platforms. Why? Because Gen Z didn’t grow up in a world without them. They didn’t understand that those social apps were never meant to create social skills and connections, but only to complement the skills and connections you already had. So going back to Ai, many of the people adopting Ai tools and praising their capabilities–those people already had critical thinking skills and domain expertise in the first place! They are using it to complement their pre-existing work! What is completely unpredictable is how the untrained, unknowledgeable generation of youth coming up next will be able to perform in a world in which whatever skills and knowledge they manage to pick up in school are basically deemed low value because, well, “Ai can already do that”.

Title: The 6 Groceries Smart Meal Planners Always Buy in Bulk
URL: https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/the-6-groceries-smart-meal-planners-always-buy-in-bulk/

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We asked experts about the best foods to stock up on to save money and trips to the supermarket. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. A recent survey by CNET confirms that rising food costs remain the top source of sticker shock—and I can relate. Over time, we've explored various strategies to stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brands versus store brands, and even asking whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk. Stocking up on everyday staples at warehouse stores like Costco can lead to significant savings. In fact, after crunching the numbers, I found that the average person could potentially save around $1,000 a year by buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't always simple. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

ByExpert Panel® ByExpert Panel®, Forbes Councils Member. To a layperson, technology and biological life may seem like opposite poles. However, the tech industry regularly draws lessons from living organisms, striving to build tools and systems that not only learn, adapt and evolve—like artificial intelligence—but can also make decisions and take action in real time, as humans do. From neural networks to swarm robotics, many of today’s most sophisticated technologies are inspired by the natural functions and collective behavior of living organisms. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share compelling real-world examples of “living intelligence” technologies, as well as natural creatures and phenomena that are inspiring adaptive tech systems and tools. Read on to learn what the convergence of nature and technology signals for the future of humanity. As a cancer scientist, I use digital AI technology to analyze cancer tissue slides. I am impressed that this innovative technology can predict immune cell types with spatial context. It can derive thousands of features that human eyes can’t see. I can see a gold mine in front of us—some of these features can be groundbreaking in detecting cancer and predicting the outcomes of therapies. - Rachel Tam, Bristol Myers Squibb Starlings exemplify one of nature’s most mesmerizing displays of swarm intelligence in action. Their behavior demonstrates how simple sets of localized rules can give rise to complex collective phenomena. This natural model has applications in modeling complex systems through simple interaction rules, giving rise to emergent properties and behaviors that are otherwise difficult to simulate holistically. - Anuradha Weeraman, Verdentra Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? Neuralink’s brain-computer interface, which enables a person with quadriplegia to control devices with their thoughts, is stunning. It’s living intelligence merging AI and biotech to restore personal autonomy. Implications include revolutionizing healthcare and enhancing human capabilities—but it also raises ethical questions about privacy and cognitive augmentation. - Lori Schafer, Digital Wave Technology Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot, which can autonomously navigate complex terrains, is a powerful example of living intelligence in action. Its ability to adapt in real time mirrors biological instinct. The broader implication? AI and robotics are evolving from scripted automation to embodied cognition, unlocking transformative potential in defense, disaster response and industry. - Srinivasa Rao Bittla, Adobe Inc. One real-world example of living intelligence that impressed me is DeepMind’s AlphaFold. It accurately predicted protein structures, solving a 50-year-old challenge in biology. This breakthrough accelerates drug discovery and disease understanding—a glimpse into AI’s potential to revolutionize science and healthcare. - Akhilesh Sharma, A3Logics Inc. AI-powered satellite imagery analysis for deforestation monitoring has impressed me. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the Global Forest Watch project has improved accuracy and speed in detecting forest loss. This highlights the potential for AI to drive environmental sustainability and inform policy decisions, ultimately contributing to more effective conservation efforts. - Pooja Jain, Meta (Facebook) A compelling example of living intelligence in cloud and DevOps is Netflix’s Chaos Engineering platform, which simulates real-world failures to proactively test system resilience. This intelligent, self-healing infrastructure ensures uptime and performance at scale, highlighting how AI-driven automation and observability can revolutionize system reliability and DevOps maturity. - Hrushikesh Deshmukh, Fannie Mae One of the most interesting cases is one developed by Alibaba Cloud. “ET City Brain” monitors the entire traffic flow of the city of Hangzhou, China, in real time, analyzing cameras, sensors, GPS and traffic lights in order to optimize circulation and reduce traffic jams. Additionally, it responds instantly to any accident or special incident. - David Barberá Costarrosa, Beeping Fulfilment The distributed decision-making of honeybees is a strong example of biological intelligence. Through decentralized communication, bees make complex collective decisions, such as choosing their new hive. AI and robotics algorithms draw inspiration from nature’s teamwork, demonstrated by swarm intelligence, which provides efficient solutions to real-world problems. - Roshan Mahant, LaunchIT Corp. Ants build cities, farm aphids and coordinate like tiny logistics pros—all without a boss. That decentralized brilliance inspired algorithms behind things like traffic flow and delivery routing. Turns out, a little chaos with clear rules scales beautifully. Nature’s “dumb” systems often outsmart centralized control—sometimes the smartest move is letting go (strategically). - Joel Frenette, TravelFun.Biz Mycorrhizal networks—the “wood-wide web”—fascinate me. Through fungal connections, trees share resources and warnings, showing a form of collective intelligence. This challenges brain-centered definitions of intelligence and reveals the deep interdependence in ecosystems—an insight vital for sustainability. - Mohit Menghnani, Twilio Tesla’s self-driving cars are a powerful example of living intelligence, learning and evolving with real-time data. Their neural network adapts continuously, making decisions that improve over time. This dynamic AI system is transforming transportation and holds broad implications for industries like healthcare, manufacturing and logistics, offering new potential for automation and efficiency. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The human brain’s ability to recognize patterns and make decisions is a prime example of living intelligence that has deeply influenced the field of artificial intelligence. The brain’s ability to process complex data through interconnected neurons, for instance, has inspired the development of neural networks, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition and natural language processing. - Udit Mehrotra, Amazon Urban crows in Japan drop nuts onto crosswalks, timing traffic to crack shells and safely retrieve food—an elegant display of living intelligence improvising and adapting to an urban environment. Crows offer inspiration for AI and robotics: context-aware, adaptive and seamlessly integrated with human infrastructure. - Amy Gu, Dynamsoft Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology stands out as a prime example of living intelligence within the e-commerce field. The system enables customers to purchase items without waiting in lines by integrating AI technology with sensors and computer vision. The retail industry is being transformed through this seamless shopping experience toward fully autonomous and personalized, frictionless retail commerce. - Amit Ojha One real-world example of living intelligence is autonomous threat detection in financial networks using AI and behavioral analytics. I have seen systems flag and isolate anomalies in real time, without human intervention. The broader impact is clear: It proves that living intelligence can adapt, learn continuously and defend complex environments with speed and precision. - Srikanth Bellamkonda Over 10 years ago, Zappos impressed me with a smart checkout prompt: After I ordered shoes, its system suggested rubber boots because of the rain forecast around my delivery date. It blended personal context with weather data—a great early example of living intelligence, long before the likes of ChatGPT normalized the use of AI. - Agur Jõgi, Pipedrive A standout example of living intelligence is Costa Group’s use of computer-vision-powered robotic pollinators in tomato greenhouses. In place of bees, these AI-driven robots improved yield by up to 15%. This showcases how smart automation can solve ecological and regulatory challenges, opening doors for sustainable, tech-enabled agriculture worldwide. - Tarun Eldho Alias, Neem Inc. Humans are being inspired by slime mold's strategic mastery. Physarum polycephalum is a brainless single-celled organism that can solve mazes and optimize nutrient pathways, challenging our notions of intelligence. Its ability to make decisions and adapt to complex environments suggests cognition may be more distributed than we think. It’s inspiring developments in decentralized computing, robotics and urban planning. - Cristian Randieri, Intellisystem Technologies An AI tool that analyzes credit risk adapts to real-time life events like layoffs or health bills. Analyzing nontraditional signals can redefine lending fairness. This living intelligence bridges empathy and economics, hinting at a future where automated finance tools react with humanlike instinct. - Jitender Jain

Title: Big Tech's next AI bet is a 'watershed moment,' analyst says — and a $1 trillion opportunity

The Middle East could rapidly become the next major frontier for artificial intelligence, and U.S. tech giants are lining up to cash in. In what Wedbush analysts are calling a “watershed moment” for Big Tech, recent developments in the region mean the AI boom might be rapidly shifting its center of gravity. A wave of investment in AI infrastructure across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is signaling an acceleration in U.S. tech companies’ expansion abroad. According to a Monday note from analysts led by Dan Ives, the region is poised to become one of the most important global markets for AI over the next decade, potentially adding over $1 trillion. “We believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years,” the note said, “and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view.” Wedbush wrote that it is becoming “crystal clear” that the “AI Revolution has found its next major area of penetration...the Middle East.” This inflection point comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s recent high-profile visit to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which focused heavily on U.S. involvement in the region’s ambitious AI infrastructure plans. Among the standout deals: Humain, a Saudi-backed AI startup, announced it will deploy 18,000 of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) cutting-edge AI chips to power a 500-megawatt data center — one of the largest of its kind. “[That announcement] is the start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,” the note said. “Riyadh and UAE will be a major buyer of AI chips, software, autonomous/robotics, and datacenters over the next decade.” For decades, the Gulf region has leveraged its oil wealth to diversify into new markets: finance, tourism, and energy-transition technologies. But this focus on AI might mark its most ambitious pivot yet. Governments in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi aren’t just buying chips — they’re buying a future in which the Middle East becomes a global AI hub. At the core of this strategy is a growing alliance between Gulf governments and U.S. technology companies. Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%), Palantir (PLTR+1.01%), and Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) are all positioning themselves in the region to be key players in what could be full-throttle AI buildout. The sharp pivot to the Middle East comes amid tensions between the U.S. and China. While Saudi Arabia is rolling out the red carpet for Nvidia’s latest-generation chips, China is seeing growing restrictions even on underpowered GPUs such as the H20, as the U.S. attempts to restrain the country’s domestic AI ambitions. This divergence is shaping up to be a central theme in the larger AI race. Wedbush characterized the Trump administration’s positioning as a “global game of high-stakes poker” to isolate China while turbocharging U.S. influence in the Gulf through technology. “China is clearly taking notice and this adds to the drama of the broader US/China tariff/trade talks over the coming months,” Wedbush said. The note said these developments are a “bullish indicator that further shows the US tech’s lead in this 4th Industrial Revolution.” And at the center of it all is Nvidia — and the “Godfather of AI,” as Wedbush calls CEO Jensen Huang — cementing its position not just as a hardware company, but as a geopolitical force shaping the future of artificial intelligence.

Title: Despite Backlash From Trump, DEI Hasn’t Disappeared at US Companies

Time Published: 2025-05-19T16:18:20Z

Walmart Inc. stunned civil-rights activists in November by saying it was pulling back on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The world’s largest retailer said it would stop using the term “DEI” in official communications, remove some LGBTQ products from its website and no longer consider race and gender to boost diversity when granting supplier contracts, among other changes. Six months later, the company’s moves seem less like a reversal and more like modest changes. “Belonging” has replaced most mentions of DEI— a semantic transition that began two years ago— but jobs posted on the company website still call for applicants who will support its policy of “diversity, equity & inclusion.” A landing page boasts about goods from “LGBTQIA+ founded brands,” accompanied by the tagline “Pride always.” And Walmart offers similar pages for Hispanic-, Black- and women-owned brands, noting that some have been categorized in collaboration with external groups that offer diversity certifications. Walmart is hardly alone. Many programs at large US companies that have fallen under the diversity, equity and inclusion banner haven’t disappeared, according to interviews with more than two dozen senior staffers from large US companies and corporate advisors. Even businesses that have made announcements purporting to curtail their DEI initiatives have, in most cases, made mostly minor adjustments, while promising investors and employees that nothing meaningful has changed. A Walmart spokesman said the company is addressing outdated references in job postings. “Our goal is to foster a sense of belonging, create opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers, and be a Walmart for everyone. We want to make Walmart the best place to work and shop,” a Walmart spokesperson said. Executive orders targeting what President Donald Trump has termed “illegal DEI” have rattled general counsels across the country’s largest companies— especially a directive that federal agencies compile lists of organizations to target for investigation by May 21. The administration argues that rather than reducing bias and encouraging managers to hire and promote based on merit, DEI policies have been “deeply demeaning,” and have increased hostility between different groups. But the orders haven’t fundamentally changed employment law, no matter how sweeping they may sound, said Jonathan Segal, a partner at law firm Duane Morris. And in many cases, familiar DEI efforts remainbecause those programs weren’t discriminating against employees. “You can do almost everything you were doing before with modest changes,” Segal said. Nor have the orders persuaded executives that all the programs that came to be known as DEI were a bad idea. Many admit that some elements of DEI went too far. However, by and large they continue to believe that efforts to recruit, promote and retain candidates from underrepresented groups are key to making sure they have the most capable and talented staff. They are loathe to eliminate policies that help workers feel welcomed and supported. They continue to fear discrimination lawsuits from workers of color, women, LGBTQ people and those with disabilities— not to mention the wrath of investors and the press. With guidance from lawyers, many companies have focused on a handful of changes. Gone are specific targets for demographic representation across their workforces, though companies are still required to collect data on the race and gender of their employees. Some people who once had titles like “diversity officer” are now called something else and run newly renamed initiatives. Employee resource groups — affinity organizations that cater to a characteristic like race, gender, sexual orientation, disability status and more — face new scrutiny and limits on their spending, but most continue to exist. Health benefits for trans employees and employees’ trans family members have hardly budged. Internship and mentorship programs developed to elevate traditionally marginalized groups mostly remain, with the new caveat that anyone can apply. Recruiting programs, especially at historically Black colleges and universities, haven’t changed. Molson Coors Beverage Co., Ford Motor Co., Deloitte LLP, McDonald’s Corp. and Boeing Co. are among those who’ve sought applicants in recent weeks through partnerships with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a non-profit group that helps some of the country’s largest companies orchestrate internship and scholarship programs for students at HBCUs, primarily Black institutions and historically Black community colleges. In one example of how companies are trying to send one message to DEI critics and another to investors, last summer Lowe’s Cos. announced a rollback that would restructure its employee resource groups, curtail external sponsorships and limit participation in external workplace surveys. But in December, a top executive promised the scale of changes were limited: “These are the only changes that we have made,” Janice Dupré, executive vice president of human resources stressed at the company’s investor day, before touting the senior leadership team as “one of the most diverse in the Fortune 500.” “Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is embedded in our values and core to who we are as a company,” a Lowe’s spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re proud of our accomplishments, and we will continue to strive to cultivate a workplace that reflects the customers and communities where we operate and where everyone feels welcomed, valued and respected.” Subha Barry, once the chief diversity officer at Merrill Lynch, now runs Seramount, a company that provides workplace training and inclusive leadership plans for large companies. Because she stays away from more controversial discussions about social justice, she said she’s seen little impact on demand for her company’s services. “There’s a return to a new sense of normalcy where companies are adapting, adjusting,” she said. “Ninety percent of our companies are saying they don’t see any major disruptions happening in the long term.” DEI is the latest term used to describe corporate policies that developed in response to the Civil Rights Act. In the 1980s, as companies prepared for rising shares of women and people of color in the workforce, executives began developing programs to better recruit, develop and integrate talent. These efforts ultimately evolved into the myriad initiatives often called DEI. While initially centered on race, the acronym came to also embody programs that would benefit a variety of minority groups, including women, people who identify as LGBTQ, those with disabilities and veterans. Such recruitment and training programs were slow to produce results, and often developed only after an investigation found evidence of rampant discrimination. Then came the 2020 murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by a White police officer in Minneapolis, setting off waves of protests about racial justice. Corporate executives responded by adopting sweeping, transformative language to spur their workforces into action, and setting ambitious goals for boosting diversity in their ranks. But just as today’s rhetoric about DEI rollback run into the reality of corporate inertia, the loud calls for boosting DEI after Floyd’s death often amounted to merely incremental changes. Many companies poured money into expanding DEI efforts based on programs they already had, hoping increased attention to race would help them transform their workforces. Such efforts met resistance almost immediately, with critics arguing that diversity programs amounted to discrimination against White (and sometimes Asian) people. They argued that bias training blamed employees for the sins of their ancestors, amplifying rather than diminishing racial angst. The pushback gained steam with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, a landmark case that overturned affirmative action in college admissions in 2023. While not directly implicated in that ruling, corporate America quickly began to question whether its own programs — especially those open to people only on the basis of race or gender — might run afoul of the course set by the court. Meanwhile, Trump’s return to the presidency has elevated DEI’s most ardent critics. His administration has argued that “corporations and universities use DEI as an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices and illegal admissions preferences.” He’s intensified the pressure on federal contractors, who must pledge that they’re not engaging in “illegal DEI,” while providing little detail on what exactly that is. “President Trump’s executive order mandates recommendations to strengthen enforcement of federal civil rights laws against unlawful discrimination, including DEI initiatives, and he anticipates further actions to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. Meanwhile, critics like influencer Robby Starbuck and activist group Alliance Defending Freedom have pushed companies to stamp out even elements of DEI that don’t violate the law, arguing that employers shouldn’t be making statements or instituting policies that express “woke” beliefs, especially about gender or race. Starbuck has said he intends to go after companies who pledged to abandon DEI but whose commitment was only “surface level.” Companies “don’t want to end up on a list, don’t want to be a target,” said Craig Leen, a partner at law firm K&L Gates and the former director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs during Trump’s first term. Trump has ordered each federal agency to identify up to nine large companies, associations and nonprofit groups that should be investigated over DEI policies. But while the administration’s signaled a new enforcement priority, the president’s actions haven’t meaningfully changed anti-discrimination law. “A lot of what companies are doing in the DEI area they’re still able to do,” Leen said, though he suggests they consider re-branding. In response, many large employers have pulled back on any initiative that might inhabit a legal gray area. DEI critics have argued that numeric goals for workforce demographics, even when only aspirational, effectively amount to illegal quotas; such metrics were on the chopping block at almost half of companies who announced changes to their DEI plans, according to a Gravity Research study. Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. are among financial firms who said they’d no longer require hiring managers to interview a diverse slate of job candidates. Segal, the employment law specialist, also tells clients to go a step further, revisiting the underlying messaging behind their DEI plans. For example, companies that say they want a workforce that “reflects the diversity of the community” might draw scrutiny, because it could be seen as suggesting a company employ a certain number of people from each demographic group. But seeking a workforce that “reflects the talent in our community” likely mitigates the risk. Surely all companies have a responsibility to shareholders to seek out the best talent, taking care to look for people with backgrounds that might historically have been overlooked. “It sounds a little bit like semantics, but the words matter,” Segal said. He estimates that three quarters of firms he’s worked with “have made changes to their communications” about diversity initiatives to ensure that they can’t be interpreted as discriminatory, but by and large the underlying programs remain intact. Companies are also saying less. The director of a nonprofit group focused on Latino entrepreneurship said it had scrapped a planned press release about financial backing from corporate philanthropy. The donor didn’t want publicity, even though they’d sought such recognition in the past. Similarly, a banker said his employer balked at adding its name to an event championing Latinos in tech, but still sponsored the event for its client-building potential. In a survey of C-suite executives published in February, law firm Littler Mendelson PC found 55% were more concerned about the risk of lawsuits related to DEI after Trump’s inauguration than they were before. Even so, 49% of respondents said they were not considering any new or further rollbacks of their programs after Trump’s executive orders, while 27% said they were considering them only “to a small extent.” In the short term, they’re simply desperate to avoid government scrutiny. Johnny Taylor, the CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, said leaders of large public companies mostly want to maintain diversity and inclusion programming that keeps workers happy. Executives don’t want to find their companies’ names on a government list of “woke” companies, he said. But they’re also worried that top law firms who’ve struck deals with the Trump administration — like Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and Latham & Watkins LLP — will fulfill their pledges to provide pro bono legal services by representing aggrieved former employees claiming reverse discrimination. What Taylor hears from CEOs is a version of: “Tell us what we can do that will affirm our commitment to this work but is not going to get us sued and get us into a protracted legal battle,” he explained. One way executives are solving that puzzle is by keeping battles quiet. A few companies, including Costco Wholesale Corp. and Apple Inc., have publicly defended their diversity efforts in the face of proposals from conservative groups to curtail those initiatives. But Deere & Co., McDonald’s and IBM — all companies that have made statements to employees or the public signaling retrenchment on DEI — have kept a much lower profile while asking shareholders to reject similar proposals. The government’s next steps remain a crucial unknown for corporate America, and the uncertainty has left lawyers at top firms guessing — and their phone lines busy. Employment “law used to be more about looking at the different court cases and giving your advice about what a court is likely to do,” said Leen, the K&L Gates lawyer and former government official. “When you have a very active administration, companies are more interested in what the administration might do than what a court might rule down the line.” Photo: A protest at Harvard University in 2023.

Title: AvalonBay braces for signs of trouble in DC rental market

Let Multifamily Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. CEO Ben Schall also said the softness in the REIT’s expansion markets could provide opportunities to add assets. On AvalonBay Communities' first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, CEO Ben Schall wasted little time before addressing some of the volatility in the current economy. “Recognizing that we are in a period of heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of policy actions on the broader economy, I want to start by emphasizing that we are very well positioned, given our portfolio makeup, our unique set of strategic capabilities and our preeminent balance sheet, to continue to deliver superior earnings growth for shareholders,” Schall said on the REIT’s earnings call. AVB, whose home is in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia, has a bird’s-eye view of the localized impacts of the Trump administration's policies, specifically those limiting federal funding and mandating government layoffs. AVB Chief Operating Officer Sean Breslin said the D.C. Metro area continues to perform as expected, and occupancy and availability align with last year's levels. Lease breaks have also fallen year over year over the previous few months. But there are some signs of trouble. “Over the last few months, we've started to hear from prospects and residents about the level of uncertainty in the job market, but to date, the velocity of activity and pricing in the region has not been impacted,” Breslin said. “About 12% of our resident base is employed by the government, so we're certainly monitoring the pace of leasing, renewal acceptance and other metrics very closely.” AVB covered more than just its home market in its earnings release and call. Here’s more on what’s happening in its established and expansion regions. AVB is projecting that new deliveries will fall to 80 basis points of existing stock in 2026, which is roughly 45,000 units across its coastal established markets, according to Schall. That level of new deliveries hasn’t been seen in 20 years. “Our established regions are benefiting from several tailwinds, including strong occupancy and very limited new deliveries this year and in 2026, which should support healthy pricing power,” Schall said. In Seattle, return-to-office mandates from Amazon, Microsoft and others; relatively strong job growth; and limited new supply in suburban markets have helped AVB. The REIT’s properties are more than 96% occupied across the Northern California region, which is about 50 basis points higher than last year. “Northern California, specifically San Jose and San Francisco, continues to improve and at a pace that's slightly ahead of our original expectations,” Breslin said. “Performance in San Jose picked up at the end of last year, but San Francisco really started to gain momentum at the beginning of this year.” As other REITs have noted, Los Angeles is more challenging. While the metro’s availability and occupancy are in line with last year's, according to Breslin, AVB’s year-to-date asking rent growth is below historical norms at just 3%. “We'll need to see better job growth in LA, which has been weak recently, to experience stronger performance throughout the remainder of this year,” Breslin said. Unlike its established regions, supply continues to be a concern in AVB’s coastal markets. “While we are pleased with the portfolios we have curated in our expansion regions, we do expect these markets to continue to face operating softness until deliveries decline and market occupancies rebuild,” Schall said. “On the flip side, this softness provides opportunities as we execute on our longer-term portfolio optimization goals, selectively increasing our allocation to our chosen expansion regions.” In Q1, AVB announced it acquired eight properties in Texas from entities associated with Little Rock, Arkansas-based owner BSR Real Estate Investment Trust. The deal closed last week. “These are all relatively simple walk-up garden assets in suburban submarkets in our target geographies,” Matthew Birenbaum, AvalonBay’s chief investment officer, said on the earnings call. “And that doesn't happen all that often. So, mostly what we've done until this point has been buying kind of one-offs, and that's still kind of the base case assumption.” Like other trades, AVB sold assets from its established regions and redeployed that capital to the expansion regions in the Texas deals. SOURCE: AvalonBay “You think about where rents in these markets have traveled over the last three years,” Breslin said. “You look at the basis at which we can enter these markets and the Texas transaction being a good example of that at $230,000 a door, and we're thinking about long-term both earnings and value creation.” AVB will also continue to grow from developments with $3 billion of projects match funded and construction costs substantially locked in. “As these projects lease up this year and next, they will produce a meaningful incremental stream of earnings that is unique to AvalonBay,” Schall said.

Title: Nvidia isn’t just building AI chips — it’s building an AI-powered world

If you missed Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) keynote at Computex 2025, here’s the short version: AI is no longer just a tool — it’s the infrastructure of the future. Robots, desktops, smart cities, physics engines, and even national computing grids — all of it, Nvidia says, will be built on artificial intelligence. Speaking in Taipei at Asia’s largest electronics expo, CEO Jensen Huang laid out a sweeping vision of the company’s future — one where Nvidia isn’t just enabling AI, it’s helping build a world run by it. Leading the announcements was the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer built for individual developers, researchers, and students. Think of it as a desktop-sized version of Nvidia’s massive Blackwell-based systems, with enough power to train and fine-tune large AI models locally — no cloud access required. It’s the plug-and-play engine for what Huang called “AI-native” users — those who want high-performance AI development at their fingertips. Major OEMs such as Dell (DELL-3.07%), ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, and Gigabyte are already lined up to offer Spark systems tailored for different segments of the market. That’s just one node in Nvidia’s broader push toward what Huang calls “AI factories” — purpose-built computing environments where massive amounts of data are processed and AI-based systems are created, refined, and deployed. To support this expansive vision, Nvidia launched something Huang said was “very special” and “one incredible ingredient” that has been missing: NVLink Fusion, an initiative that allows its GPUs to work seamlessly with third-party CPUs and custom AI chips. That means companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM+0.20%), Fujitsu, Marvell (MRVL-1.67%), and Alchip Technologies can plug into Nvidia’s ecosystem — a notable shift for a company long known for its tightly integrated stacks. “I’ll let all of our partners price it for themselves, but one thing’s for sure: Everybody can have one for Christmas,” Huang said. But this wasn’t just a cloud-computing conversation. It was one about bringing AI into the physical world. Nvidia doubled down on “physical AI” — the idea that machines should understand and interact with the laws of the real world. Huang talked about Isaac Groot N1 (announced in March), which is a foundational model for robotics that gives humanoid robots the ability to reason, plan, and perceive their surroundings. “The age of generalist robotics has arrived with breakthroughs in mechatronics, physical AI, and embedded computing — just in time as labor shortages limit worldwide industrial growth,” Huang said. One challenge in robotics today is data scarcity, especially high-quality, physical interaction data. Nvidia hopes to answer this problem with Cosmos, a photorealistic simulator that creates synthetic data by observing human behavior in virtual environments. Isaac Groot N1, combined with Cosmos, means developers could now create massive amounts of training data in virtual worlds before rolling out systems in the real one. Developers can now use Groot Dreams — a tool built on Cosmos — to create “future world states,” Huang said, by prompting the model with new tasks and images. This makes it possible to simulate millions of training scenarios before deploying robots in the real world. To help ground those dreams in physical reality, Nvidia will use the recently announced Newton, an open-source physics engine built in collaboration with Google DeepMind (GOOGL-1.57%) and Disney Research (DIS-1.33%) that will be open sourced in July. It’s designed to help AI systems understand real-world dynamics such as gravity, collisions, and torque — bridging the gap between code and physical context. “It’s incredible what it can do,” Huang said. “It’s completely GPU accelerated. It’s differentiable, so you could learn from experience. It is incredibly high fidelity.” Meanwhile, Nvidia is planting deeper roots in Asia with Nvidia Constellation, a new AI-focused hub in Taipei’s Beitou Shilin Science Park. It’s a strategic play — tapping into Taiwan’s world-class semiconductor ecosystem while deepening Nvidia’s presence in the global AI supply chain. Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, attended Huang’s keynote and later told reporters that the city fully supports Nvidia’s plans and is ready to offer whatever help is needed. One of the most strategically significant announcements came near the close of Huang’s keynote: a joint effort to build a national AI supercomputer in Taiwan. Nvidia will partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+0.63%) (TSMC), Foxconn, and the Taiwanese government to create a cutting-edge AI system for the island. This project aims to integrate AI deeply into urban infrastructure, transforming cities such as Taipei into smart ecosystems powered by advanced computing. The initiative underscores Nvidia’s goal of embedding AI — and thus, its products — into the fabric of daily life, from autonomous vehicles to intelligent public services. Huang’s overall message was unmistakable: AI is no longer just software. It’s infrastructure. It’s automation. It’s everywhere. And Nvidia wants to not only build just the silicon — it wants to build but the systems, the software, and the global footprint to power it all. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Digital asset investment products managed by firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares drew in $785 million of net inflows globally last week, marking the fifth consecutive week of gains, according to data from CoinShares. The latest inflows have pushed year-to-date figures to $7.5 billion, surpassing the previous high of $7.2 billion set in early February. “It also fully recovers the near $7 billion of outflows experienced during the February-March price correction,” CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote in a report published Monday. Source: CoinShares While Bitcoin-related products continued to attract the most capital, with $557 million in inflows, Ethereum-based funds saw a notable rebound. Ethereum products registered $205 million in inflows last week, bringing the year-to-date total to $575 million. Butterfill described Ethereum as the “standout performer” for the week, citing renewed investor confidence following the Pectra upgrade and the appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as co-executive director. However, only $41.8 million of those Ethereum inflows came from US-listed spot ETFs, highlighting mixed sentiment across markets. Bitcoin traded in a narrow range between $102,000 and $105,000 during the week, while Ether declined about 3%. Total assets under management across crypto investment products stood at $172.9 billion, close to record highs. Despite the strong weekly inflow, Bitcoin products saw a decline from the $887 million recorded in the previous week. Butterfill attributed the slowdown to ongoing hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million in inflows, marking their fourth straight week of gains. US-based crypto investment products led inflows with $681 million, followed by Germany at $86.3 million and Hong Kong at $24.2 million — the latter’s highest since November 2024. In contrast, Sweden, Canada, and Brazil registered outflows of $16.3 million, $13.5 million, and $3.9 million, respectively. Among altcoins, XRP and Sui recorded inflows of $5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink saw smaller positive movements. Solana-based funds were the only segment to report net outflows last week, with $0.9 million withdrawn.

Title: China's Xiaomi will spend $7 billion on homegrown chips amid the trade war
URL: https://qz.com/xiaomi-7-billion-chips-in-house-trade-war-lei-jun-1851781251
Time Published: 2025-05-19T14:52:00Z

China’s Xiaomi will invest at least $6.9 billion over the next decade to develop its own semiconductor chips, the company announced Monday. CEO Lei Jun made the announcement in a post on the Chinese social media site Weibo. He said the tech giant is “well aware of the difficulty of chip manufacturing,” but it has “formulated a long-term and continuous investment plan: at least ten years of investment, at least 50 billion yuan, steady and steady, step by step.” The first chip, the Xring 01, will be unveiled at a company event on May 22. Xiaomi previously started making its own chips beginning in 2014, unveiling them three years later, but the project was eventually scrapped due to a number of setbacks. The new chip initiative began in 2021, Lei wrote Monday. “Xiaomi has always had a ‘chip dream’ because, in order to become a great hard-core technology company, chips are a peak that must be climbed and a tough battle that cannot be avoided,” he said. The company will manufacture integrated chips for use with its own smartphones. Apple (AAPL-0.39%) popularized the so-called system-on-a-chip (SoC) process, which combines essential functions on a single circuit to save space and power. Apple’s in-house chip designs have helped it remain dominant in the tech space. Xiaomi has relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm (QCOM+0.20%) and Taiwan’s MediaTek for chips, according to Business Insider. Qualcomm will reportedly continue to do so, yet stock was down about 1% Monday morning. The move makes Xiaomi the latest Chinese tech firm to focus on developing its own chips amid the U.S.-China trade war. In April, Huawei announced that it was getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival those made by Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%). In addition to the tariffs placed on China by President Trump last month, the U.S. has been restricting chipmakers from selling certain chip technologies to Chinese firms for years in an effort to curb the country’s advancements with AI chip technology. The approach has hurt business for U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, which previously sold components to many Chinese firms.

BounceBit, a crypto infrastructure provider using features from both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), has executed a bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trading strategy using BlackRock's yield-generating tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to enhance returns. The strategy, to be rolled out to institutions and retail users, consisted of two main components: a bitcoin basis trade, involving a long position in the spot market while shorting futures, and a short position in BTC put options, both collateralized by BUIDL tokens. The basis trade, also known as cash and carry arbitrage, alone generated an annualized yield of 4.7%, with put option writing contributing an additional 15%. Combined with the 4.25% return from BUIDL used as collateral, the total yield exceeded 24%. Integrating BUIDL as collateral helped generate a higher return than strategies collateralized by stablecoins, which do not generate any return. "This strategy allows investors to capture both Treasury Bill yields and funding rate arbitrage returns," Jack Lu, founder and CEO of BounceBit said in a press release exclusively shared with CoinDesk. "BounceBit bridges the gap between Western real-world asset issuers and Asian crypto trading infrastructure, providing new options for yield generation," Lu said. BounceBit is the native BTC restaking chain secured by staking both bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. The network allows BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem and a CeFi-like mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital. As of writing, cryptocurrencies worth over $500 million were locked on BounceBit. BounceBit plans to roll out the BUIDL-collateralised strategy to institutional and retail users soon. "The successful pilot is a proof of concept to our new product line BB Prime, which will be available to both retail and institutional users," BounceBit's spokesperson told CoinDesk. "This strategy underpins BB Prime as a new class of CeDeFi applications built on top of RWAs which are traditionally troubled by a lack of utilities beyond just holding for t-bill yield, hindering mass adoption," the spokesperson added. BUIDL, launched in March 2024 by Securitize and BlackRock, is a tokenized investment fund operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos and Polygon. The token, currently boasting a market cap of $2.88 billion, is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds, boasting a stable value pegged at one dollar per token. Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

May 19, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Big Tech's great flattening is happening because it's out of options

Welcome back! In case you missed it, our new newsletter, Tech Memo, written by the great Alistair Barr, launched on Friday. Check out the first edition here. And if you aren't already, subscribe here. In today's big story, we're looking at Big Tech's obsession with cutting out middle managers and flattening their orgs. What's on deck Markets: When companies like Facebook and Zillow IPO, they turn to this man Tech: How one of the hottest coding startups almost died. Business: Gen Z is turning to blue-collar jobs. But first, no longer stuck in the middle. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Technology can quickly become outdated, but it's a job title in tech that's an endangered species: the middle manager. Big Tech is flattening its ranks to thin out layers of management in a bid to reduce bureaucracy, writes Emma Cosgrove, Tim Paradis, Eugene Kim, and Ashley Stewart. Middle managers have had to keep their heads on a swivel for a while. At the end of last year, BI's workplace expert Aki Ito detailed Corporate America falling out of love with the role. But the tech industry has taken the trend into overdrive, as is often the case. From Microsoft to Intel and Amazon, companies are shedding managers to make themselves as quick and lean as possible. The biggest immediate impact of flattening orgs is managers overseeing more workers. Some argue that will limit micromanagement. Others say you'll burn out the managers who are left behind. Big Tech is willing to take its chances, though. As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last fall: "I hate bureaucracy." "The goal again is to allow us to have higher ownership and to move more quickly," Jassy added. Big Tech's middle-management purge speaks to a larger trend: Let the stars shine and get rid of anyone else. Part of tech companies' efficiency push is to identify top performers and weed out underachievers. With that approach, you could argue there is less of a need for managers. No weak links in the chain means managers don't have to do as much hand-holding. Get out of the way and let your top performers do what they do best. This isn't a foolproof strategy, though. Someone being extremely capable at their job doesn't always correlate with them being an easy employee to manage. In fact, sometimes the opposite can be true. But what other options do these tech giants have? The pressure from startups like OpenAI and Anthropic is undeniable. Their smaller size also gives them a massive leg up to move quickly. And when it comes to AI, speed is the name of the game. Meanwhile, middle managers seem to only be slowing companies down. 1. Trump's "Big, beautiful bill" could cause some big chaos. Market pros say the president's tax bill would add $4 trillion to the US deficit, stoking mayhem in the bond market. That means another Trump vs. bond market showdown could be headed our way. 2. Bankers tell startups wanting to go public: "Go, go, go." Startups like Hinge Health put their IPO plans on hold when Trump introduced sweeping tariffs. Now that the stock market has recovered, bankers are telling companies to go public while they still can. 3. This "hick from Ohio" is a big deal for IPOs. Pat Healy could be the forefather of getting stock exchanges to compete for the right to get a company to list with them. From free Davos advertising to NFL star appearances, here's how Healy lands companies major marketing perks. 1. "Appstinence" is a virtue. Raised in the age of the smartphone, a growing cohort of people, mostly millennials and Gen Zers, are opting for dumb tech instead. As the evidence of our collective phone addiction adds up, even tech lovers are embracing the digital detox movement. 2. How Silicon Valley's favorite startup came back from the edge of disaster. StackBlitz was at death's door when Anthropic released its AI model Sonnet 3.5 in 2024. That led StackBlitz to create Bolt.new, a product that could write code based on prompts written in English — and the company's gold mine. BI's Alistair Barr has the full story. 3. Is AI coming for teachers? Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn thinks so. On a recent podcast appearance, he told venture capitalist Sarah Guo that schools will still be necessary in an AI-driven future — but mostly just for childcare. He thinks AI will do the actual teaching. 1. Gen Z is dyeing white collars blue. The cost of college is skyrocketing, and the white-collar job market is unstable. That's led many young people to turn to trades instead, which can offer six-figure salaries and have a high demand for workers. 2. Selling a merger to Trump? MAGA-ify it. Cable giant Charter is merging with Cox, posing a bigger rival for Comcast. The merger still needs the green light from the Trump administration, and it seems like Charter is leaning into pro-American rhetoric to get it, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 3. LA investor Jessica Mah is in a legal battle with DGV investor Justin Caldbeck and two ex-employees. In a lawsuit, Mah has accused Caldbeck of sexually harassing her, which he denies. The lawsuits against Mah, meanwhile, accuse her of misusing company funds, harassment, and age discrimination, BI's Rob Price reports.

Title: US-Sino AI Rivalry Enters ‘Competitive Coexistence’ After Tariff Truce

ByVivian Toh ByVivian Toh, Contributor. The U.S. and China strike a 90-day tariff agreement. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty ... More Images) Wall Street and Shanghai markets may have cheered the U.S.-China tariff détente, but beneath the surface optimism lies a profound strategic recalibration of the world’s most consequential technological rivalry. The May 12 agreement, a 90-day suspension of escalating tariffs, has seen U.S. duties on Chinese imports plummet dramatically, from an aggressive 145% down to a more moderate 30%, while China reciprocated by reducing tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%. This temporary peace, however, signals not an end to hostilities but a new phase defined by careful maneuvering and intense strategic rivalry, aptly termed "competitive coexistence." Influential Chinese commentator Ren Yi, widely known as Chairman Rabbit, encapsulated Beijing’s view by describing the tariff truce as a "beautiful counterattack." In a widely circulated WeChat post, Ren portrayed the agreement as a pragmatic victory against the Trump administration’s "impulsive paper-tiger tactics," underscoring China's long-term strategic acumen and disciplined approach in contrast to America's more reactive stance. His narrative resonated deeply with domestic Chinese audiences, reflecting Beijing’s confidence in its strategic positioning amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Yet, beyond political narratives, global financial markets have demonstrated notable resilience. After the initial tariff announcement on April 9 triggered widespread anxiety, markets had already begun to recalibrate expectations by the time the two nations officially announced the truce. From April 9 to May 12, technology stocks notably benefited from investor confidence in the resilience and adaptability of major firms. Alibaba led the charge with a remarkable 25.5% rise in its share price, followed closely by Tencent with a 17.3% increase and Baidu’s 13.3% gain. U.S. tech giants also shared in the relief rally: Meta’s shares surged by 9.2% and Apple’s by 6%, although Alphabet’s stock experienced a modest decline, reflecting lingering investor concerns about its international regulatory exposure and vulnerabilities in key global markets. Share price of U.S. and China tech giants before and after the tariff truce. This market adjustment represents more than mere optimism — it highlights a deeper shift in investor psychology. Geopolitical tensions are no longer seen as isolated threats but strategic inflection points demanding corporate agility and adaptability. Investors increasingly expect firms to navigate geopolitical uncertainties effectively, turning potential disruptions into opportunities for strategic recalibration. Central to this recalibration is the intense race for artificial intelligence dominance. American companies like Meta and Microsoft are vigorously expanding AI capabilities through advanced cloud services, partnerships and product innovations. Meta's strong growth reflects increasing demand for its AI-powered ad tools and content creation services, which have significantly enhanced user targeting and engagement. Microsoft, meanwhile, continues to integrate OpenAI’s cutting-edge technologies into its Azure cloud platform, seeking to set global standards in enterprise AI solutions. Chinese tech giants are equally aggressive, accelerating development of self-contained AI ecosystems in response to tightening U.S. restrictions, including export controls on advanced AI chips and critical technologies. Tencent, for instance, reported robust financial results in Q1 2025, with revenues climbing 13% year-on-year to RMB 180 billion ($25.1 billion). This growth was fueled primarily by its Value-Added Services segment, including blockbuster games such as Honour of Kings and Delta Force, as well as AI-driven marketing enhancements on platforms like Weixin Search. Despite substantial investments in AI, Tencent managed an 18% rise in operating profits to RMB 69.3 billion ($9.7 billion), underlining its capacity to balance strategic investments with profitability. Meanwhile, China’s strategic pivot toward domestic technological innovation has been particularly evident in AI infrastructure development. Initiatives like Baidu’s PaddlePaddle and Alibaba’s ModelScope illustrate a determined push to build sovereign technological stacks capable of competing independently of foreign technologies. The broader geopolitical context, especially U.S. export controls and the rescinding of the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule — replaced with targeted restrictions — has galvanized China’s resolve to innovate autonomously. The strategic realignment also underscores broader shifts in global supply chains, with U.S. companies actively diversifying manufacturing and production away from China to hedge against future geopolitical shocks. Apple epitomizes this approach through its accelerated expansion in alternative manufacturing hubs like India and Vietnam — a strategy known as “China+1.” However, despite these tactical shifts, China’s entrenched role in global manufacturing, bolstered by its extensive supplier networks, skilled workforce and manufacturing efficiencies, renders complete decoupling unrealistic and economically disruptive. Capital and talent flows have similarly been reshaped by geopolitical tensions. Chinese firms now face increasing obstacles when attempting to access foreign investment or public markets. Heightened scrutiny of researchers’ visas and the politicization of academic collaborations have further complicated talent acquisition. Nevertheless, both China and the U.S. continue to significantly ramp up domestic investments. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act channels substantial federal funds into semiconductor and AI research, aiming to safeguard technological leadership. China mirrors these efforts with extensive initiatives bolstering technology zones, intensifying public-private partnerships and prioritizing STEM education nationwide. The resulting environment is one of strategic caution combined with sustained competitive aggression — a delicate equilibrium captured by the term "competitive coexistence." Companies must adeptly navigate a dual reality of collaboration and competition, reflecting a fragmented yet interconnected global technology landscape. In this new paradigm, the defining contest between the U.S. and China transcends tariff skirmishes. Instead, the battlefield extends to innovation, scalability and influence over international technological standards. This truce thus provides not only temporary economic relief but also a moment of clarity, spotlighting the relentless drive of both superpowers toward long-term technological supremacy. The markets, now more accustomed to such dynamics, perceive geopolitical frictions as persistent realities that demand continuous strategic foresight and adaptability.

Title: Why META Stock Is A Prime Choice In The AI Boom

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/18: In this photo illustration, the Meta AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why pay a premium of 35 times earnings for Microsoft stock when Meta stock is available at 25 times earnings? This seems particularly questionable when considering the following three key factors: Meta isn't exactly a safe haven investment. To illustrate this, consider how Meta's stock has reacted during past market shocks: it experienced a significant 77% decline during the 2022 inflation shock, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of only 25% for the S&P 500. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Meta’s stock fell by 35%, while the S&P 500 saw a comparable decline of 34%. These instances suggest that Meta is not a particularly "safe" stock. Also, see Buy or Sell Meta Stock. Furthermore, it has already seen substantial gains this year, rising 7%, and a remarkable 32% in just one month, climbing from around $485 on April 21st to $640 currently. On the other hand, for a more balanced perspective, consider the Trefis High Quality strategy, which has outperformed the market with over 91% returns since its inception, as demonstrated in the HQ performance metrics. Confident in the long-term potential of the AI revolution? Meta Platforms presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its unique position. Unlike companies solely focused on AI development, Meta integrates AI across its massive and growing user base. The daily active people (DAP) across Meta's family of apps have grown by an impressive 16%, from 2.95 billion in 2022 to 3.43 billion currently. This vast engagement provides a distinct advantage in monetizing AI advancements through enhanced advertising, content recommendations, and overall user experience. A substantial portion of the company's revenue is directly generated from ad sales on its key platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, making AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and delivery particularly impactful. Supported by significant investments in AI research and development, and leveraging this unparalleled global social media network, Meta is strategically positioned to capitalize on AI growth, regardless of the dominant technologies that emerge. Despite its compelling advantages, investing in Meta is not without risks. A key concern is the potential for earnings to fall short of expectations or for sales growth to decelerate from 22% in the past year to a possible 15% in the near future. This slowdown could be driven by broader economic headwinds, where businesses might reduce advertising expenditures to preserve capital, particularly in the event of slowing economic growth or a recession. Furthermore, unforeseen or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock’s performance. Consequently, investors should be prepared for the possibility of significant declines, potentially reaching 50% or more. Selling during such downturns could be detrimental to long-term returns. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider consulting a financial advisor with experience navigating multiple bear markets. They can provide insights into strategies like the Trefis HQ strategy and other prudent approaches to potentially capitalize on market downturns. Remember, substantial wealth can be generated in such environments by maintaining a rational perspective. Considering these factors, if you are a long-term investor with a 3-to-5-year horizon and a buy-and-hold strategy, Meta could present an interesting entry point at its current valuation, even after its recent price increase.

Speaking at the Computex trade show, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that Nvidia will work with Taiwan’s government and Foxconn’s Big Innovation Group to construct the new system, which will house over 10,000 of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell GPUs. The supercomputer will be deployed at the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC) and support Taiwan’s leading academic institutions and Nvidia’s key chip partner, TSMC, as per a company statement on Monday. “We are growing beyond the limits of our current office [in Taiwan],” Huang said, debuting concept footage of the company’s upcoming “Constellation” HQ, designed to resemble a spacecraft landed in Taipei’s Beitou district. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes tech firms to onshore manufacturing, rolling back Biden-era export restrictions while cracking down on AI chip sales to China. Nvidia has pledged to invest $500 billion in U.S. infrastructure, but Monday’s announcements show the company’s deep dependence on Taiwan’s supply chain and scientific institutions. According to Nvidia, the new system will deliver more than eight times the AI performance of the existing Taiwania 2. It will feature HGX H200 nodes, Blackwell Ultra-based B300 systems, and GB200 NVL72 racks, all connected via Nvidia’s Quantum InfiniBand networking. “The new NCHC supercomputer will drive breakthroughs in sovereign AI, quantum computing, and advanced scientific computation,” said NCHC Director General Chau-Lyan Chang. Among the projects it will power TAIDE, a national effort to build large language models tuned to Taiwanese culture and language; a generative AI development platform called Taiwan AI RAP; and simulations in climate modeling, quantum chemistry, and epidemic prevention. Nvidia’s CUDA-Q platform has already enabled researchers to run a record-breaking 784-qubit quantum simulation, according to the statement. A new hybrid quantum-classical computing system is also in development. The Taiwan rollout follows Huang’s recent trip through the Gulf with President Trump, where Saudi Arabia committed to a $600 billion investment package spanning AI, energy, and infrastructure. As part of that initiative, Nvidia agreed to supply at least 18,000 Blackwell GPUs to power “Humain,” a state-backed Saudi AI firm developing a 500-megawatt data center. The company also unveiled NVLink Fusion, a new effort to let rival AI chips connect directly to Nvidia’s platform, aimed at locking its GPUs into the backbone of next-gen AI systems. “Nothing gives me more joy than when you buy everything from Nvidia ... but it gives me tremendous joy if you just buy something from Nvidia,” he said. Nvidia (NVDA) is currently trading at $135.40, up 0.42% on the day, per Google Finance data.

Title: Hired-Hand Billionaires 2025: These 48 Executives Got Rich Working For Others
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2025/05/19/hired-hand-billionaires-2025-these-48-executives-got-rich-working-for-others/

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. Most billionaires got rich by building businesses or inheriting big bucks from someone who did. Yet a small but growing group of current and former American executives have managed to amass three-comma fortunes as very well-paid employees. Altogether, Forbes found a record 48 of these hired-hand billionaires in 2025, up from 29 a year ago. And that count is sure to keep climbing thanks to soaring share prices and sky-high executive pay packages. The average annual compensation of the ten highest-paid CEOs in America shot up more than sevenfold from $46 million per year in 2010 to a peak of $330 million per year in 2021, according to data firm Equilar. Most Americans build their wealth through a salary or hourly wage, but top execs are often paid in stock options and other share awards that vest over several years and are often tied to performance. And that’s increasingly the case, with the average equity component of CEO pay packages growing from 54% in 2012 to 66% in 2023, per executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. That’s helped the best-paid CEOs in the U.S. keep getting richer, even as the average pay of the top ten chief executives has actually fallen post-Covid, to a still-enviable $125 million per year in 2023, the most recent year for which full data is available. Because the stock market has continued to climb, with the S&P 500 up nearly 370% since 2010 and nearly 25% since 2021, the value of the shares many of these executives were awarded in the past has skyrocketed, helping the rich get richer and making more companies big enough to birth non-founder billionaires than ever before. Back in 2010, only seven of America’s 403 billionaires were hired-hands, accounting for just 2% of the country’s richest people. That included six former executives who are also on this year’s list: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, the two richest hired-hands by far today, as well as Jeff Skoll and Meg Whitman of eBay, John Brown of medical equipment maker Stryker and Hamilton “Tony” James of Blackstone. (The seventh, former Cisco CEO John Morgridge, has since fallen from the billionaire ranks.) Fifteen years later, hired-hand billionaires are still relatively rare, but their numbers have increased at a rate that outpaces the incredible growth of America’s three-comma club overall, suggesting that the ten-figure fortunes minted by these current and former non-founder executives aren’t just the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. Today, 5% of America’s nearly 900 billionaires are hired-hands, up from 4% when Forbes last counted them in February 2024, when there were nearly 760 U.S. billionaires. There are 18 newcomers in this year’s group, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, FICO CEO William Lansing, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell, former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, longtime Nvidia director Harvey Jones and Howard Lutnick, who left his role as chairman and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to become President Trump’s secretary of commerce in February. AMD CEO Lisa Su is the only hired-hand on last year’s list who failed to make the cut this year, as shares of the chipmaker she runs have cratered by nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, early Uber employee Ryan Graves and Bob Muglia, the former CEO of cloud-based database software firm Snowflake, have regained their billionaire status and returned to this year’s ranking after failing to make the 2024 list of hired-hands. Here are a few of the most notable newcomers on this year’s hired-hands list (net worths are as of May 13, 2025): Born and raised in Russia, Shikin joined marketing software and mobile game maker AppLovin as vice president of engineering when the company was founded in 2012. He was promoted to chief technology officer in 2020 and helped take the company public a year later. Shikin owes a big chunk of his fortune to a performance-based share award he was granted in 2023 that could only be fully unlocked if AppLovin’s stock price soared sixfold in five years. The company hit that once unfathomable goal by the third quarter of 2024, and the company’s market capitalization has skyrocketed by another 370% since to $125 billion, amid a frenzy for anything remotely AI-adjacent. Shikin owns a nearly 1% stake in AppLovin between his stock and options that is worth $1.6 billion. He is one of eight AppLovin billionaires, including fellow hired-hand Herald Chen. Winkelried joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 and rose to president and co-chief operating officer in 2006, alongside President Trump’s future chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn. When Winkelried retired three years later, he walked away with 1.5 million Goldman shares that would be worth nearly $900 million today with the bank’s shares soaring nearly sixfold since the end of March 2009, plus options to acquire another 1.1 million shares (though Forbes assumes that Winkelried likely diversified his holdings along the way, and a spokesperson declined to comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2015 to become co-CEO of TPG alongside the private equity giant’s billionaire cofounder Jim Coulter. Winkelried was promoted to sole CEO in 2021, when Coulter stepped back into his current role as executive chair, and the pair helped take TPG public in 2022 with the firm’s other billionaire cofounder David Bonderman (d. December 2024). TPG’s stock has soared by more than 50% since the IPO, and the 5% stake Winkelried has earned so far for his 10 years of service to the firm is now worth more than $950 million. Culp joined Danaher, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire brothers Mitchell and Steven Rales, in 1990 and rose to president and CEO in 2001. By the time he retired 14 years later, Culp had helped boost the company’s stock price by more than 500% and netted nearly $230 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting stock along the way. That left him with 1.7 million split-adjusted shares that would be worth nearly $350 million today with Danaher’s stock up more than 200% since, plus options to acquire another 2.9 million split-adjusted shares (though Forbes assumes that Culp likely diversified his holdings along the way, and his spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2018 to lead the turnaround of troubled General Electric as chairman and CEO. He has broken up the bloated conglomerate into three separate public companies after spinning off its healthcare business as GE HealthCare in 2023 and its energy business as GE Vernova in 2024. Shares of the original company, now known as GE Aerospace, have nearly quadrupled since Culp took over as CEO, earning him shares of all three companies that are worth more than $400 million combined. After nearly a decade at Google, Arora left for Japanese investment giant Softbank in 2014, where he was promoted to president and chief operating officer a year later and touted as the likely successor to the firm’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son. Things didn’t go as planned, and Arora resigned from his executive roles in 2016, though he remained at the company as an advisor for another year. He ended up cashing out at least $360 million (before tax) during his short stint at Softbank between his lucrative pay package and resignation agreement. He spent a year angel investing, then joined cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks as chairman and CEO in 2018. The firm, which was founded by an Israeli-American entrepreneur named Nir Zuk, who now serves as chief technology officer, in 2005 has seen its stock price soar nearly sixfold since Arora took over, making both him and Zuk billionaires. Arora has netted nearly $800 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting shares over the past two and a half years, leaving him with stock and options worth another $340 million. Brown is the longest-serving CEO of Motorola after the firm’s cofounder Paul Galvin (d. 1959) and his son Bob Galvin (d. 2011). Brown joined Motorola in 2003 and was promoted to chief executive in 2008. He spun off the company’s struggling legacy smartphone business as a separate public company called Motorola Mobility in 2011, and the Razr maker was acquired by Google for $12.5 billion a year later. (It’s now part of Lenovo.) Then, through a series of more than 50 acquisitions, Brown has transformed the company now known as Motorola Solutions into a nearly $70 billion (market capitalization) behemoth in the market for mission-critical public safety communications, 911 command center solutions and video security. The firm’s stock has soared more than sixfold since Brown took over, and he’s netted more than $700 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling shares along the way. He still owns Motorola Solutions stock and options worth a further $600 million. Baratta and Chae are two of five hired-hand billionaires from Blackstone, the nearly $180 billion (market capitalization) alternative asset management giant cofounded by billionaires Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson (d. 2018). Baratta joined Blackstone in 1998 and moved to London in 2001 to help build the firm’s European private equity business. He has served as global head of private equity since 2012. Chae joined Blackstone in 1997 and ran its international private equity business before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2015 and vice chairman in January. Blackstone’s stock is up nearly 15% over the past year, and Baratta and Chae each own shares worth nearly $1 billion. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, the software giant’s chairman and CEO is a billionaire for the first time. Nadella joined the tech giant in 1992 and rose to CEO in 2014, when America’s richest hired-hand billionaire, Steve Ballmer, retired that year. Nadella was named chairman in 2021, replacing veteran tech exec and investor John Thompson, who had assumed the role from Microsoft’s billionaire cofounder Bill Gates in 2014. Nadella has made Microsoft a major player in the AI boom, investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and leading the development of Microsoft’s own suite of AI-powered tools called CoPilot. He owns just 0.01% of the $3.4 trillion (market capitalization) company’s stock, but that’s just enough to make him a billionaire—when combined with his more than $600 million in (pretax) share sales.

May 19, 2025 05:20 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that the Elevance Health class action lawsuit – captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., No. 25-cv-00923 (S.D. Ind.) – seeks to represent purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock and charges Elevance Health as well as certain of Elevance Health’s executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-elevance-health-inc-class-action-lawsuit-elv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Elevance Health class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 11, 2025. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Elevance Health operates as a health benefits company. Among other things, the cost of providing health benefits to members is driven by the level of care a patient requires, often referred to as “acuity,” and the members’ utilization of the health benefits, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Medicaid redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance Health’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs; and (ii) this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance Health’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 17, 2024, Elevance Health revealed that it was now “expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint. Then, on October 17, 2024, the Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that Elevance Health announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that Elevance Health had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance Health further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 11%. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Elevance Health common stock during the class period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit.

Title: How President Trump is sparking a crypto revolution in America

By Rafael Nam President Trump addresses the Bitcoin 2024 conference at Music City Center in Nashville, Tenn., when he was still a candidate. Jon Cherry/Getty Images hide caption For years, crypto was viewed by many as a weird and fringe investment, hyped up by a bunch of math geeks and used widely by all kinds of unsavory characters, from drug dealers to hackers. It was known for spectacular returns — and spectacular crashes: Top crypto exchange FTX collapsed just two years ago, landing its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, in prison. Now, a radical shift is taking place under President Trump. From financial regulators to the halls of Congress and all the way to the Oval Office, the U.S. is fully embracing — and even promoting — crypto. It is a remarkable turnaround from the Biden administration. And crypto companies are emerging as big winners. On Monday, one of the top exchanges in the sector, Coinbase, is joining the S&P 500, the stock market index that tracks the biggest traded companies in the U.S. "I think it's a historic moment for the industry and it's a really special moment for Coinbase," says Faryar Shirzad, the company's chief policy officer. "Having Coinbase be the first crypto company that's on the S&P 500 and (to be) be in a position where more and more people are beginning to watch how we operate (and) what we do is really exciting for us." President Trump himself also stands to benefit financially. Shortly before his inauguration, he even launched his meme coin — a crypto asset known more for being tied to internet memes and jokes. And his family is getting into the action too with financial interests in crypto companies. Advocates of cryptocurrencies welcome the developments, believing the U.S. is finally embracing — and taking a global leadership role in promoting — an area they say will help define the future of the financial sector. But critics are aghast, warning that the U.S. is promoting an investment with a history of incredible volatility that will end up hurting scores of average Americans, potentially setting up a financial crisis like the one the world experienced in 2008. "History is going to show this will be a disaster courting a catastrophe for the rest of the country and especially for Main Street Americans, who are going to get stuck with the bill cleaning up after the next financial crash," says Dennis Kelleher, a prominent crypto critic at advocacy group Better Markets. Whatever anyone believes, however, one thing's clear: Trump has ushered in a new golden era for crypto. From Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 to the deep regulatory shifts, here are three ways to understand what's taking place in the crypto sector. Perhaps the most sweeping changes have taken place at the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mission is to police the financial sector and protect investors. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC aggressively went after the crypto sector, with lawsuits and enforcement including against top crypto companies such as Coinbase. Gensler, who stepped down early this year, called crypto "the Wild West." and sought to rein in the industry, comparing it to the period before the Great Crash of 1929 when the financial sector was dominated by "hucksters" and "fraudsters" before federal laws on securities were put in place. His approach set him up as an enemy for the sector as he sought to get companies such as Coinbase to register with the agency and comply with its regulations, despite protests from crypto companies that they shouldn't be considered part of traditional Wall Street. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler took a much more aggressive approach against crypto companies when he headed the agency. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption No longer. The agency has staged a remarkable turnaround starting even before the new SEC head Paul Atkins was sworn in last month. In one of the agency's biggest decisions, it dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase that accused the company of trying to operate outside of its purview. It reassigned its chief litigation counsel to a new role managing IT systems. (The SEC did not reply to a request for comment from NPR.) Crypto companies have welcomed the changes, calling them a needed readjustment from what they saw as excessive heavy-handedness under the Biden administration. And regulators such as the SEC and the country's law enforcement are not necessarily giving up on overseeing crypto altogether. Just this month the former founder and CEO of a crypto company called Celsius Network was sentenced to 12 years for fraud and market manipulation. Yet for consumer advocates, the changes are devastating. Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection at Consumer Federation of America says it's akin to letting "crypto run wild." It's also personal for Frayer, who was at the SEC for more than three years. "It is very frustrating to see three years of, you know, 65, 70-hour weeks that me and my team worked to try and protect investors and get this industry compliant with the law, be erased in essentially three months," Frayer says. "And it is surprising to see, given the risks that it creates for the traditional financial system." When crypto exchange FTX collapsed, many analysts thought at the time that it would permanently tarnish crypto, validating warnings by critics about the dangers of the industry. Instead, something remarkable happened: Crypto has gone legit. By early 2024, BlackRock, one of the biggest financial firms in Wall Street, was the first to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, offering investors — including mom and pop ones — an easier way to invest in the cryptocurrencies. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried arrives for a bail hearing at Manhattan Federal Court in New York City on Aug. 11, 2023. When the crypto exchange collapsed, many thought it would permanently tarnish the crypto sector. It's done anything but. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption Super PACs representing crypto companies spent over $100 million in the 2024 election cycle, helping elect lawmakers they view as friendlier to the crypto industry to Congress. And now, Coinbase is set to become part of the S&P 500 starting at the open of trade on Monday, replacing Discover Financial Services, which is being acquired by Capital One Financial. "Coinbase joining the S&P 500 means crypto is here to stay. It's going to be in everybody's 401(k), everybody is going to have crypto exposure at least indirectly through Coinbase," said Brian Armstrong, the company's CEO, in an interview with Yahoo Finance. As crypto goes increasingly mainstream, another person stands to benefit directly: President Trump himself. Trump's launch of his meme coin sparked controversy even within the crypto industry, which sees it as a distraction that could undermine the credibility of the industry. Although $TRUMP lost a substantial part of its value since launching, President Trump sent the price of the coin soaring for a while when he announced he would hold a special dinner this Thursday for the top 220 holders of the meme coin as measured during a three-week period that ended earlier this month. That has sparked accusations that investors, including from abroad, rushed to buy Trump's currency as a way to influence the president. And it goes beyond meme coins. Members of the Trump family are also in. His sons are involved in crypto ventures that are reportedly exploring financial deals with major crypto companies as well as foreign-backed entities. President Trump's son, Eric Trump, who's an executive at the Trump Organization, participates in the Token 2049 crypto conference in Dubai on May 1. Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Ultimately, all the changes that are taking place under President Trump have consumer advocates concerned that it will end in a crisis similar in scope to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. There are similarities, according to crypto critics. Back then, financial firms peddled complex financial investments with elaborate names like credit default swaps or collateralized debt obligations — investments that few understood and turned out to be a house of cards that collapsed and dragged the global financial system down with them. "You have these predatory instruments that come into the marketplace. They're advertised as innovations. They're advertised as serving low-income communities or middle-class Americans. And at the end of the day, they blow up," consumer advocate Frayer says. "The companies that foisted them upon Americans get bailed out or do fine, and everyone else is left holding the bag. So I am afraid this is like 2008 all over again." An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that President Trump has invited the top 220 holders of his namesake memecoin for dinner this Wednesday. The dinner is on Thursday.

Title: CE 100 Index Jumps 5% as Shopify Gets a Post-Earnings Bump; Payment Brands Rally

A rally across all market indices, as China-focused tariffs were reduced, helped lift the CE 100 Index 5% higher in a week that saw almost all pillars advance, with the exception of the “Be Well” segment. In the Shop vertical, up 7%, Shopify surged 20.3% to take the lead among gainers for the week. Shopify’s first-quarter earnings results showed double-digit growth in gross merchandise volumes (GMV) and a continued movement toward streamlined checkout online and further inroads made in offline commerce. “It’s still early to assess the full impact of the current trade environment,” Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said on the conference call with analysts. He added that “We’re, of course, monitoring for potential slowdowns, but our data through April shows little evidence of that.” The company’s earnings results noted that revenues were up 27% to $2.4 billion; GMV surged 22% to $74.8 billion. Offline GMV increased 23% and B2B GMV delivered triple-digit growth, up 109% from the year-ago first quarter, Finkelstein said. Tencent took the Pay and Be Paid segment up 6.9%. In its own quarterly report, Tencent’s CEO noted that its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities had “contributed tangibly” to its gaming and advertising businesses. Revenue was up 13% year over year to 180 billion yuan ($25 billion). “We also stepped up our spending on new AI opportunities, such as the Yuanbao application and AI in Weixin,” CEO Ma Huateng said, referring to the company’s super app. Domestic Games revenues were 42.9 billion yuan, representing a 24% year-over-year increase from last year. Tencent shares were 18% higher. Also within the payments sphere, Affirm’s stock gained 13.2%. Affirm is partnering with Costco to offer online shoppers the option to pay over time for transactions. Customers, if approved, will be able to select monthly Affirm payment plans when shopping on Costco’s website. Also within the payments pantheon, PayPal’s stock was up 2.7%. The company’s shares rose in the wake of news that AI search company Perplexity has launched a partnership with PayPal. The collaboration will see Perplexity use PayPal to power agentic commerce on its Perplexity Pro platform. Beginning this summer, U.S. consumers can check out instantly using PayPal or Venmo when they ask Perplexity to look for products, book travel or purchase tickets, per the announcement. As for the payment networks themselves, Visa and Mastercard gained a respective 3.6% and 2.6%. As detailed by PYMNTS, a group of trade associations representing European retailers reportedly asked the European Commission to take action against Mastercard and Visa under European Union antitrust rules, alleging that the companies charge high fees and don’t provide transparency on those fees. In a letter, the associations also called for price controls on interchange fees, transparency and nondiscriminatory obligations for International Card Schemes, and a tool for regulators to scrutinize ICSs’ actions. A Visa spokesperson told PYMNTS the firm’s fees reflect the value of its services, adding: “This includes extremely high levels of security and fraud prevention, near-perfect operational resilience and reliability, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality, innovative products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs.” The Be Well segment was the only decliner, slipping 1.1% as United Healthcare plunged 23%. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth Group for possible criminal Medicare fraud related to its Medicare Advantage business.

Title: Legendary investor Ron Baron shares the early contrarian lesson that's helped him return 1,843% over 22 years
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ron-baron-shares-the-first-investing-lesson-he-ever-learned-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-19T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
It's hard to imagine Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital, knowing little about investing. Baron is one of the most successful investors of his time, amassing more than $41 billion in assets under management since 1982. His Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) is up 1,843% since launching in May 2003, trouncing the S&P 500's 536% return and beating 99% of similar funds over the last 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar data. But like all of us, he was once a beginner, too. After studying chemistry and then attending law school, Baron finally decided he wanted to work in finance. With no job offer, he moved into a friend's basement in New Jersey until he could find work. His engineer parents weren't happy. But his uncle bought him a copy of Joseph E. Granville's "A Strategy Of Daily Stock Market Timing For Maximum Profit." Reading it, Baron learned his first major lesson about investing: taking a contrarian approach to prevailing market consensus can pay off. "What made sense in this book, which was not intuitive, was that when news was really bad, you're supposed to invest, you're supposed to buy things," Baron told the Economic Club of New York on May 13. "And when news was really good, you're supposed to sell things." Essentially, don't chase returns on the back end of rallies when all the good news is already priced in. It's time-tested advice that many investing legends espouse. Warren Buffett's famous mantra was to "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Sir John Templeton wrote: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." Investor sentiment has been all over the place in recent weeks. After President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement, investors became exceptionally bearish on stocks. A month ago, CNN's Fear and Greed Index was in "Extreme Fear" territory. But the outlook has improved as Trump has started to back off from his trade war. Right now, "Greed" is the dominant feeling among investors. Today, Baron is uber-bullish on Tesla, saying he believes its share price will grow 10x from current levels. The stock makes up 35% of his Baron Partners Fund. While Baron doesn't trade short-term macro developments, instead betting on companies he thinks will outperform over the long term, he still applies the lesson he learned early in his career by being ahead of the consensus on the stocks he buys and seeing future outcomes that no one else sees. "It's about being the opposite of what everyone else says," he said. And when things are going awry in markets and the economy, Baron stays cool and thinks about the big picture. "I just figure like John Lennon that in the long run, everything's going to work out. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end yet," he said. "Sooner or later, everything works out. Man causes problems and then fixes the problems." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to

Title: China remains committed to high-level opening up

A robotic dog is exhibited at the 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, April 16, 2025. (Photo by Wu Wenjun/People's Daily Online) The recently concluded 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, saw the participation of 288,000 overseas buyers from 219 countries and regions. On-site intended export deals reached $25.44 billion, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent. Multiple indicators hit record highs, underscoring China's determination to share its development opportunities with the world through high-level opening up. At a time when globalization is facing headwinds and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, China is opening its door wider to the world, providing much-needed stability and certainty to the global economy. Opening up to the world is the fundamental national policy of China that has endured throughout more than four decades of reform and opening up. This long-standing commitment remains a vital pathway for China to pursue its own development while contributing to global prosperity. By promoting development through opening up, China has been widely recognized as an oasis of certainty and a hot spot for investment and entrepreneurship. China's high-level opening up is a continuous effort rather than a completed mission. Actively expanding imports is also a key part of this strategy. China does not deliberately pursue a trade surplus. It is working to foster more balanced trade by actively increasing imports. In 2024, the total value of China's imports reached 18.4 trillion yuan ($2.55 trillion), up 2.3 percent year on year, setting a new record. The country has maintained its position as the world's second-largest importer for 16 consecutive years. Photo taken on April 19, 2025 shows crowds of people visiting the 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair. (Photo by Huang Taiming/People's Daily Online) The China International Import Expo (CIIE) is the globe's first national-level exposition dedicated to imports, demonstrating China's commitment to opening its market and advancing trade liberalization and economic globalization. From hosting international cooperation platforms such as the CIIE, Canton Fair, China International Fair for Trade in Services, China International Consumer Products Expo, and China International Supply Chain Expo, to promoting the brand of "Invest in China" and launching the "Shopping in China" series, China is providing broad development opportunities for global companies with a spirit of openness. Meanwhile, it has given all the least developed countries with which it has diplomatic relations zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. With these ongoing efforts, the enormous Chinese market is turning into a shared global market, demonstrating China's sense of responsibility as a major country. China's determination to expand high-level opening up remains unwavering. This is not only a clear position but also evident in concrete actions. In the first quarter of this year, 12,603 new foreign-invested enterprises were established in China, representing a year-on-year growth of 4.3 percent. Meanwhile, China has removed all market access restrictions for foreign investors in the manufacturing sector. The items on its negative list, which specifies fields that are off-limits to foreign investors, have been further slashed to 29 in the national version and 27 for pilot free trade zones (FTZs). China has also released a guideline for improving its FTZs and approved a plan that aims to expand comprehensive pilot programs to accelerate the services industry's opening-up. These efforts reflect China's steady drive to expand institutional opening up, such as that of rules, regulations, management, and standards, and its commitment to deepening and broadening opening up. As Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, noted, China has a spirit of openness where businesses worldwide can connect, forge partnerships and contribute to a more prosperous and interconnected global economy. China's pursuit of high-level opening up has expanded the space for mutually beneficial China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation. In 2023, the U.S. set up 1,920 new enterprises in China, with an actual investment of $3.36 billion, up 52 percent from the previous year. At the same time, China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has generated substantial business opportunities and profits for American companies. For example, Tesla's electric vehicle sales in the Chinese mainland have hit a record high of 657,000 units in 2024, up 8.8 percent year on year. China's voluntary opening policies have benefited financial institutions from all countries including the United States. More than 10 American insurance companies have subsidiaries in China. American financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, American Express, Bank of America, and MetLife, have achieved substantial investment returns as strategic investors in Chinese financial institutions. Meanwhile, BlackRock, Fidelity, Neuberger Berman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Alliance Bernstein have been allowed to establish wholly foreign-owned fund management companies in China. Some U.S. politicians have called for greater opening up of China to American business for the good of both China and the United States. The fact, however, is that China has repeatedly affirmed its welcome to companies from all countries, including the U.S., to invest and thrive in China. China has developed sound regulations, policies and procedures for foreign investment, promoted trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and made active efforts to foster a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. It has been and will remain an ideal, safe, and promising destination for foreign investors. It is hoped that the U.S. will refrain from creating obstacles for American companies seeking to invest in China, and stop using national security and America First as catch-all pretexts for demanding openness from others while tightening its own trade restrictions. Such protectionist moves risk disrupting global industrial and supply chains and weakening the multilateral trading system. Only through mutually beneficial cooperation can China and the U.S. realize their respective development goals. This not only serves the common interests of both countries but also meets the expectations of the international community.

With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. Baxter & Bailey could've taken the safe route for their Friday evening talk at OFFF. They could've showcased slick work for the Royal Parks, the Royal Mail, or the London Soundtrack Festival. Instead, they pulled back the curtain on what really goes on behind the pristine curtain of the design industry, revealing a tangle of mistakes, mishaps and moments of pure chaos. "We live in a world where everything we see is finished, polished and presented, which can be quite a daunting prospect for young designers entering the industry," they explained. "It's a nice reminder that even the most experienced designers mess up sometimes." With that, Matt and Dom launched into an hour of confession, comedy, and collective therapy. It was an airing of creative dirty laundry, shared in the spirit of learning and laughter. Baxter & Bailey started with their own biggest fumbles, warming the crowd up for what was to come. Dom kicked things off with a tale from a night train journey in Russia en route to a crucial pitch for a telecoms giant. Sharing a cabin with a snoring stranger called Constantin from Moscow, he awoke to find his roommate enjoying breakfast in nothing but his pants. In the panic to flee, Dom left his carefully crafted presentation boards on the train. "What I learnt from that mistake was: even if you wake up and the first thing you see is an old Russian man's crotch, keep cool, don't panic and remember what you're doing," Dom told the crowd. Matt followed with a story from a concept presentation a decade ago. Just a few minutes in, the client's top boss entered the boardroom, watched in silence… then stood up, gave a thumbs down, and stuck out his tongue with a rude noise of disapproval. "I still cringe every time I hear that story," said Dom. The pair soon revealed they weren't alone in their confessions. Before the talk, they'd floated the idea to British design legend Rian Hughes, who not only approved but offered his own disaster story. On screen, Rian recalled his first job interview at a Camden agency. Lost, rain-soaked, and 45 minutes late, he finally arrived with his portfolio strapped to a trolley. As he lifted it onto the table, he noticed something brown on his sleeve and realised he'd rolled the trolley through dog poo. One side of his portfolio was covered, and so was the director's mahogany table (not to mention the stench). "Despite this auspicious beginning, I got the job," said Rian. "But I don't recommend it as an interview technique – and the job was shit anyway. I lasted three months." With proof of concept secured, Baxter & Bailey launched The Design Laundry, a growing archive of creative calamities submitted by designers across the industry. The idea is that people share their worst moments, get them out in the open, and maybe learn something in the process. Here are just a few they aired at OFFF. Jamie Ellul, founder of Supple Studio, joined in from the remote countryside to share his cautionary tale. Early in his solo career, he landed a job designing a brochure for an accountancy firm. "I think it might have actually looked worse than it did in the beginning when I was finished," Jamie admitted. He sent the final artwork to print, then forwarded the printer's quote to the client before hopping on a train. Following weeks of radio silence, the client finally replied: 'Hi Jamie, I've been wondering how to respond to your email, having seen your note to the printer below on the email chain'. That note read: 'Please don't judge me—this is the shittest thing I've ever designed'. Cue laughter from the crowd – and a lesson in double-checking email chains. As Matt and Dom pointed out, email fails were the most common type of submission. We've all been there. Next up: Francis Jackson, formerly of MetaDesign and OPX and now a psychotherapist, shared her story in a letter. Years ago, she worked with The King's Trust on a beautifully designed book promoting the value of art in the built environment, Art in the Public Environment. The problem was that a glaring typo was revealed by none other than the King of England himself after hundreds of printed copies went out across the country. What the front cover actually said was: 'Art in the Pubic Realm'. When the King was handed a copy while visiting the offices, he swiftly returned it, eyebrows raised. I'm sure Francis was hoping for the ground to open up beneath her at that moment! Daljit Singh, co-founder of pioneering digital agency Digit, appeared onscreen in sunglasses, mid-holiday, to recount a transatlantic disaster. After landing in the UK from New York in 2007, Daljit got a message: Gene Simmons (yes, from KISS) wanted to meet him. Being a huge fan, he turned around, caught the next flight back, and headed straight to the hotel. But as he flew, doubt crept in, and he asked himself: could it be a prank? He'd played an elaborate hoax on his friend Simon not too long ago, so when told to ask for "Simon Smith" at reception (apparently Gene's alias), his suspicions grew. Still, he went upstairs, knocked on the door, and shouted, "Simon, come out, you massive tosser." None other than Gene Simmons opened the door. "You English guys have got such strange senses of humour," he said, before ushering Daljit in. The meeting lasted three awkward minutes. They didn't get the job. After airing these disasters, Matt and Dom returned to each story to highlight the learning points. Jamie reminded us to treat every job (and every email) with care. Francis' typo showed that even major mistakes fade with time. Daljit's story offered a reminder not to let doubt derail bold decisions. The laundry pile grew with more stories, laughs, and stains, and the pair could've gone all night. Luckily, this won't be the last spin cycle for The Design Laundry. Dom and Matt are bringing the idea to future events and inviting more submissions through their website. Because if creativity is a messy process, there's no shame in airing a little dirty laundry.

Title: Texas Stock Exchange CEO Sees State Muscling In on NYC, Delaware

The head of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange said the state is making a serious play to reshape the US financial landscape, using new pro-business laws and a proposed ban on trading taxes to take on longtime power centers on the East Coast. Governor Greg Abbott signed legislation this week aimed at strengthening legal protections for companies and curbing shareholder challenges, part of a broader strategy to lure corporate registrations from Delaware. Meanwhile, a ballot measure in November would ban taxes on securities transactions just as a group of New York lawmakers is pushing to bring back a state levy on stock sales. “Texas is going in direct competition with Delaware and New York, Delaware for registrations and New York for listings and the exchange operators,” Jim Lee, founder of the Texas Stock Exchange, said in an interview a day after attending a signing ceremony with Abbott. The new measures show “the commitment that the state is making to building out capital markets here.” Lee’s Dallas-based bourse project is backed by the likes of BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and pipeline billionaire Kelcy Warren. But for all the progress Lee has made, he still has a long way to go to get the Texas Stock Exchange up and running. The exchange is still under review by US securities regulators. Lee said approval will potentially come by the end of the third quarter, keeping the schedule on track to begin trading early next year. The exchange will soon have about 60 employees working from a temporary office in Dallas. It’s still shopping for a permanent space, which it plans to announce in the summer. The industry’s powerful incumbents appear to be taking notice. The New York Stock Exchange announced it would reincorporate its Chicago operations in Dallas to start an equities exchange in Texas. Nasdaq Inc. unveiled a plan to open a regional headquarters in Dallas. Together, the two exchanges dominate US listings. “It’s flattering and we welcome them,” said Lee, chief executive officer of TXSE Group Inc., the parent company of the Texas exchange. “We’ve been driving this process for years now and we welcome them to the effort. They are formidable competitors.” The TXSE is trying to break through at a time when growing US businesses have been staying private for longer, tapping funding sources such as private equity firms that offer capital without the costs of operating a public company. Calling such expenses “a flaw in our public markets,” Lee is pledging to offer predictability to listing companies while holding down costs. He has national and global ambitions but says the initial focus will be on companies in the “southeastern quadrant” of the US from Texas to Florida and the Carolinas. Its primary trading platform will be in Secaucus, New Jersey. “The solution is, you have to have a lot more alignment and predictability for public companies, and we have to drive down cost,” he said. While the New York proposal to reinstate a tax on stock sales has little chance of becoming law for now, Lee said any future steps in that direction would benefit his state. Texas is also trying to entice companies to move their incorporation to the state as more executives question Delaware’s status as the gold standard for business litigation. Texas is developing a system of business courts. Elon Musk won shareholder approval last year to move Tesla Inc.’s incorporation to Texas after a Delaware judge voided his record-setting pay package. His Space Exploration Technologies Corp. also moved its incorporation to Texas from Delaware last year. Topics Texas

May 19, 2025 00:25 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- COMPUTEX -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.5, the first update to NVIDIA’s open, generalized, fully customizable foundation model for humanoid reasoning and skills; NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams, a blueprint for generating synthetic motion data; and NVIDIA Blackwell systems to accelerate humanoid robot development. Humanoid and robotics developers Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Foxlink, Galbot, Mentee Robotics, NEURA Robotics, General Robotics, Skild AI and XPENG Robotics are adopting NVIDIA Isaac™ platform technologies to advance humanoid robot development and deployment. “Physical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “From AI brains for robots to simulated worlds to practice in or AI supercomputers for training foundation models, NVIDIA provides building blocks for every stage of the robotics development journey.” New Isaac GR00T Data Generation Blueprint Closes the Data Gap Showcased in Huang’s COMPUTEX keynote address, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams is a blueprint that helps generate vast amounts of synthetic motion data — aka neural trajectories — that physical AI developers can use to teach robots new behaviors, including how to adapt to changing environments. Developers can first post-train Cosmos Predict world foundation models (WFMs) for their robot. Then, using a single image as the input, GR00T-Dreams generates videos of the robot performing new tasks in new environments. The blueprint then extracts action tokens — compressed, digestible pieces of data — that are used to teach robots how to perform these new tasks. The GR00T-Dreams blueprint complements the Isaac GR00T-Mimic blueprint, which was released at the NVIDIA GTC conference in March. While GR00T-Mimic uses the NVIDIA Omniverse™ and NVIDIA Cosmos™ platforms to augment existing data, GR00T-Dreams uses Cosmos to generate entirely new data. New Isaac GR00T Models Advance Humanoid Robot Development NVIDIA Research used the GR00T-Dreams blueprint to generate synthetic training data to develop GR00T N1.5 — an update to GR00T N1 — in just 36 hours, compared with what would have taken nearly three months of manual human data collection. GR00T N1.5 can better adapt to new environments and workspace configurations, as well as recognize objects through user instructions. This update significantly improves the model’s success rate for common material handling and manufacturing tasks like sorting or putting away objects. Early adopters of GR00T N models include AeiRobot, Foxlink, Lightwheel and NEURA Robotics. AeiRobot employs the models to enable ALICE4 to understand natural language instructions and execute complex pick-and-place workflows in industrial settings. Foxlink Group is using them to improve industrial robot manipulator flexibility and efficiency, while Lightwheel is harnessing them to validate synthetic data for faster humanoid robot deployment in factories. NEURA Robotics is evaluating the models to accelerate its development of household automation systems. New Robot Simulation and Data Generation Frameworks Accelerate Training Pipelines Developing highly skilled humanoid robots requires a massive amount of diverse data, which is costly to capture and process. Robots need to be tested in the physical world, which can present costs and risk. To help close the data and testing gap, NVIDIA unveiled the following simulation technologies: Foxconn and Foxlink are using the GR00T-Mimic blueprint for synthetic motion manipulation generation to accelerate their robotics training pipelines. Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Fourier, Mentee Robotics, NEURA Robotics and XPENG Robotics are simulating and training their humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab. Skild AI is using the simulation frameworks to develop general robot intelligence, and General Robotics is integrating them into its robot intelligence platform. Universal Blackwell Systems for Robot Developers Global systems manufacturers are building NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 workstations and servers, offering a single architecture to easily run every robot development workload across training, synthetic data generation, robot learning and simulation. Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro announced NVIDIA RTX PRO-powered servers, and Dell Technologies, HPI and Lenovo announced NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell-powered workstations. When more compute is required to run large-scale training or data generation workloads, developers can tap into NVIDIA Blackwell systems like GB200 NVL72 — available with NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud on leading cloud providers and NVIDIA Cloud Partners — to achieve up to 18x greater performance for data processing. Developers can deploy their robot foundation models to the NVIDIA Jetson Thor platform, coming soon — enabling accelerated on-robot inference and runtime performance.

After securing a strong base of support in the 2024 election, Donald Trump is positioning himself for a renewed push in foreign policy — an area that his supporters argue has deteriorated under recent Democrat direction. With growing global instability and concerns about America’s waning influence abroad, many see Trump’s return as an opportunity to reassert U.S. strength on the world stage. Citing what they view as failures in diplomacy, deterrence, and global leadership under the Biden administration, Trump’s supporters anticipate a more forceful, deal-driven approach that prioritizes national interest and restores America’s negotiating power. The Deal with Ukraine One of the most significant early foreign policy moves of President Donald Trump's second term is the U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed on April 30, 2025. The agreement, seen as a strategic counter to Russian influence, was finalized after months of complex negotiations and is viewed by Trump’s supporters as a testament to his assertive and transactional approach to foreign policy, especially in contrast to the strategies of the previous Democrat administration. Almost immediately, Democrat lawmakers and affiliated media outlets began to raise red flags. They argue that the agreement reflects an overly transactional and politicized approach to foreign policy, questioning whether Trump bypassed traditional diplomatic protocols to bolster his political standing. Democrats expressed concerns over the agreement’s terms, with some advising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reject the deal, citing fears of compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty and the absence of explicit security guarantees. Notably, Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) met with Zelenskyy shortly before his Oval Office meeting with Trump, urging caution against a “fake peace agreement” lacking security arrangements for Ukraine. Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) likened Trump’s approach to a coercive real estate tactic, suggesting the deal resembled a demand for Ukraine to “pay rent” through mineral concessions. Furthermore, Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) characterized the agreement as “extortion” in a televised interview. Undercutting Democrats’ Political Narrative Many Democrats view major deals initiated by Donald Trump as potentially damaging to their own standing because these deals shift the narrative in Trump’s favor. When Trump achieves visible wins on the international stage, it challenges Democrat criticisms of his leadership and complicates their messaging. Such developments can resonate with voters who prioritize results over rhetoric, thereby posing a threat to Democrat poll numbers and weakening their leverage in debates over foreign policy direction and executive decision-making. The Democrat party has built a complex network of influence across key financial and institutional channels. Supporters see this as a strategic framework for implementing progressive policy goals and ensuring long-term institutional stability. Initiatives like Trump’s foreign economic deals — particularly those negotiated outside traditional diplomatic or bureaucratic structures — are viewed by some Democrats as threats to a financial and governance model they have helped shape over decades. A growing concern among Trump-aligned policymakers is that meaningful progress in reshaping U.S.-Ukraine relations may be stalled as long as key Ukrainian institutions remain heavily staffed or influenced by figures aligned with pro-Democrat frameworks. Any effort by Trump to establish a new kind of dialogue with Ukraine may be constrained until there is a shift in Ukraine’s internal political and administrative landscape — one that allows for greater openness to his administration’s more transactional and sovereignty-focused foreign policy approach. And a notable example is Tomáš Fiala, a key figure in Ukraine’s financial sector with deep ties to Western institutions and a consistent advocate of liberal democratic alignment. Ties with Soros and the Democrat Party Fiala is the CEO and founder of Dragon Capital, a leading Ukrainian investment firm. He has served as the elected President of the European Business Association (EBA) from 2010 to 2015 and again from 2016 to 2021, leading Ukraine’s top business organization comprising over 1,000 companies with more than a million employees. He was also elected to the Board of Transparency International Ukraine from 2016 to 2020, part of a leading global anti-corruption watchdog. In October 2020, Fiala was elected to the Board of Directors of the Kyiv School of Economics. He has been associated with George Soros through business partnerships and media ownership in Ukraine. In 2015, Soros became an anchor investor in a new Ukraine fund managed by Dragon Capital, marking a significant international investment in the country following its 2014 revolution. Additionally, Dragon Capital’s pro-Western stance and Soros’s involvement have been noted in discussions about media ownership and potential foreign influence channels in Ukraine. By the way, Soros Fund Management has held various investment positions across the financial sector, including bonds issued by major firms like BlackRock. Regarding connections to the Democrat party, the media outlets associated with Fiala have supported Democrat figures. For instance, reports indicate that a media group funded by the Open Society Foundation and managed by Fiala played an active role in the U.S. electoral process, supporting Democrat candidates. As Trump Sets the Narrative, Democrats Struggle to Respond Some Democrat strategists are reportedly growing concerned that the ideological momentum behind Trump-aligned populism could disrupt their longstanding influence over policy and financial frameworks - both domestically and in foreign relations. This includes not only narrative control but also influence over financial channels such as foreign aid, NGO funding, and institutional partnerships. With the 2026 Congressional elections approaching, many within the Democrat party see the stakes as increasingly high. For them, preventing a deeper shift in public sentiment — and preserving their grip on key institutions and funding networks — has become a political priority. But Democrat strategies to counter his influence have largely fallen flat. Rather than offering a compelling alternative vision, many within the party appear to be relying on the hope that Trump will eventually sabotage himself through legal missteps or controversial decisions. Despite internal calls for a bold rebranding, Democrats remain fragmented and overly reactive, often focused more on opposing Trump than defining their own agenda. This passive stance leaves them vulnerable, especially as Trump continues to dominate political discourse with a clear, sovereignty-focused message. Ultimately, waiting for him to stumble may prove to be a losing strategy as the 2026 congressional elections approach. Ensuring Loyalty and Effectiveness As Donald Trump pushes forward with a series of high-profile foreign policy initiatives — ranging from negotiations with Ukraine on resource development to renewed diplomatic overtures in the Middle East — the Democrats are increasingly focused on delaying or obstructing these efforts. In this view, the Democrat strategy is less about offering a clear foreign policy alternative and more about buying time to regroup and rebuild public support after electoral losses. To effectively carry out the policy agenda, the president must continue to go beyond reforming agencies like USAID and pursue broader leadership changes across the federal government because as it stands, certain agencies are remaining staffed with individuals whose ideological leanings conflict with Trump’s vision. If Trump leaves pro-Democrat officials in key government and diplomatic positions, the Republicans risk enabling internal opposition that could undermine their foreign policy goals. These individuals, aligned with previous administrations’ multilateral and progressive agendas, may reinterpret or redirect the implementation of Trump-initiated deals to align with Democrat priorities.

Title: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’ Review: Benicio Del Toro Hilariously Dominates Wes Anderson’s Latest All-Star Wes Anderson Movie – Cannes Film Festival

By Pete Hammond Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic Like Jacques Tati, Woody Allen and Luis Buñuel, there can be no mistaking a movie directed and written by Wes Anderson. An auteur in the truest sense of the word, he is as much a painter with words and visuals that put us unquestionably into part of a brain that sees the world the way he wants to see it. There’s his Oscar-winning masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel; animated gems Isle of Dogs and my favorite Wes movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox; and a string of beloved film comedies including The Royal Tannenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom and so many more including his 2024 Oscar-winning short The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. It is good to report that the filmmaker is back in style with his latest, The Phoenician Scheme, after stumbling a bit through the overly narrated and artificial (even for Anderson) Asteroid City, the most recent of his films to debut in Cannes, just as his latest world builder, The Phoenician Scheme, did Sunday night in Competition. This one is particularly refreshing in that, instead of focusing on a number of characters, here it is Benicio Del Toro‘s Zsa-Zsa Korda, a shady, uber-wealthy industrialist who dominates the proceedings much the way we saw in other Anderson riffs like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Sure, there are the usual starry cameos running through the story, but it is all in the service of Zsa-zsa, a man who dominated the business world and global economy in Europe in the early 1950s in much the same way we see Elon Musk now, an equally shady rich guy whose track record is spotty at best. In fact, there also are sly comparisons we could make even to Donald Trump with this man, whose enemies are doing everything to bring down his empire where he is accused of swindling banks, skipping tariffs, filing frivolous lawsuits — you name it, he’s done it. But is it all bad? Watch on Deadline RELATED: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’s Benicio Del Toro, Michael Cera & Mia Threapleton On Wes Anderson’s Comedic Timing – Cannes Studio Zsa-zsa, who has survived six airplane crashes including the latest one that opens the film on a note of excitement, is even starting to see God, or at least a group of religious leaders who act as therapists in a way in fantasy sequences where he thinks he has died. Somehow he never does, even with a price on his head by any number of would-be assassins. His latest plan, with the lofty name of the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme, has him enlisting his 20-year-old daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton), who is in training to become a nun but whom he thinks could be better suited to ultimately take over his company and complicated financial dealings. Why not his nine — count ’em — nine sons (another Musk comparison)? He wants to give Liesl a shot. The idea is to create an infrastructure scheme for an unused area of Earth that can be mined for a potentially rich region that doesn’t exist yet. In return, his business takes in 5% of the newfound riches in perpetuity. To do this he also has to enlist a number of wealthy donors from the worlds of shipping, mining, railroad, banking, real estate and the black market. Their identities all are contained in a set of shoeboxes, each with a particular specialty. RELATED: Cannes Film Festival 2025: Read All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews First up is a visit to Prince Farouk (Riz Ahmed), who has proven savvy with his kingdom’s natural wealth, then to an underground tunnel for a meeting with railroad barons Leland (Tom Hanks) and Reagan (Bryan Cranston). Another box introduces us to Marseilles Bob (Mathieu Amalric), a gangster and nightclub owner who wants terrorists to stop shooting up his place. There alsois the shipping magnate (Jeffrey Wright) who could be crucial; a second cousin named Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, in briefly) who could be new wife material; and finally leading up to his brother, the conniving Uncle Nubar (a very amusing Benedict Cumberbatch), who is big trouble in the family. With Liesl just as interested in trying to solve her mother’s murder (could it be Nubar?) as in closing the gap of Zsa-zsa’s vast finances, they are on dueling paths, joined by the other major character to complete this triangle, that of Norwegian tutor Bjorn (Michael Cera), who also studies insects. Of course he does! As Anderson explains the mindset of Zsa-zsa, “he is a certain type of businessman who can always pivot. He has no obligation to the truth.” The director cites all sorts of real-life figures from the past as inspirations for this man, people only a Jeopardy! contestant might be able to reel off instantly, but you can certainly see the Trump/Musk influence creeping in, even though this was written long before their partnership got into the picture. At least that is what I sniff here, proving Anderson’s wholly fictional creation has some odd relation to our current reality. Can you imagine Zsa-zsa living in these times? RELATED: Full List Of Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery As with all Anderson films, the production values are spectacular. This one was shot almost exclusively on soundstages at Studio Babelsberg in Germany. Bruno Delbonnel’s lush cinematography (first time working on a feature with Anderson, who usually goes back to the same well of artisans) and Adam Stockhausen’s production design are exquisite as are Milena Canonero’s costumes and Alexandre Desplat’s score. The film belongs lock, stock and barrel to Del Toro, playing this Onassis-style billionaire who proves again to be so adept to the rhythms of Anderson’s dialogue and delivers flawlessly here. So do newcomer Threapleton as Liesl and Cera, a first-timer in Anderson’s stock company who undoubtedly will be asked back. Ahmed and Cumberbatch also are welcome additions, as is regular Richard Ayoade as a terrorist leader. Look for Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham as pop-ups along the way, with Hanks, Cranston, Johansson and others in for a fun day’s work. Anderson, Jeremy Dawson, John Peet and Steven Rales are producers.

Title: Limerick hammer Cork in statement Munster hurling championship win

AS STATEMENT PERFORMANCES GO, this one from Limerick will rank as highly as anything they’ve produced in the John Kiely era. They blew Cork away by 16 points this afternoon to leave their home support in a joyous mood in the May sunshine. Qualification from Munster has been assured and Limerick’s status as favourites to land a seventh provincial title on the bounce has hardened after the scale of victory they delivered here. Cork were left chastened after this beating and know they must now get a positive result at home to Waterford next Sunday to prolong their season. The cold truth was that this game was settled by the interval, Limerick retreating to the dressing room with the comfort of a commanding 2-18 to 0-9 advantage. Goals from Aaron Gillane and Adam English underlined their utter dominance in that period. After Tom Morrissey had snapped over a brace of points, Gillane set the tone in the third minute when he gathered the ball in the left corner and took advantage of a slip by Niall O’Leary. The Patrickswell man galloped in along the endline, sidestepped Ciarán Joyce, and drilled home his shot. Cork’s Alan Connolly and Diarmaid Byrnes of Limerick James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Cork did notch the next three points of the game to cut the deficit to two but they were chasing in Limerick’s slipstream for the remainder of the afternoon. By the time Limerick raised a green flag again in the 27th minute through English, released by the outstanding Cian Lynch for the strike, they were 2-12 to 0-6 clear. The signs were ominous for Cork and they could have shipped further goals but Barry Nash’s effort went wide under pressure from a swarm of Cork defenders, Shane O’Brien was hooked on another occasion, and in the same passage of play, Tom Morrissey’s effort was blocked on the line by Mark Coleman. The pressure on the Cork defence was intense. Limerick, driven on by the power of their half-back line where Kyle Hayes excelled, were in control and Cork couldn’t get their attacking game going to bag the boost of a goal at the other end. Nickie Quaid was equal to a Patrick Horgan strike in the 21st minute after Brian Hayes fashioned an opportunity, and Cork were left staring at a 15-point deficit at the break. Advertisement Cork’s Shane Barrett and Tom Morrissey of Limerick. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO The second half had a lower-key feel to it. Cork sprung Séamus Harnedy from the bench and he landed two points during his time on the pitch, while Horgan finished with 1-9 to his credit, but his overall display also featured some poor shooting as he chalked up four wides from frees and dropped another short. Cork landed seven of the first 10 points in the second half, substitute Cormac O’Brien impressing, but it was damage limitation stuff such was the majesty of hurling that Limerick had produced in that opening period. Cork’s goal arrived ten minutes from full time, Horgan smashing home a 20-yard free after Brian Hayes had been fouled. The outburst of celebration in the Cork support was soon quelled as Limerick grabbed their third goal, Gillane firing home a penalty after he was fouled by Eoin Downey. Substitutes Cathal O’Neill and Peter Casey kept the Limerick scoring tally ticking over, and the champions are now in the driving seat to return to another provincial decider. Scorers for Limerick: Aaron Gillane 2-7 (1-6 frees, 1-0 pen), Adam English 1-2, Tom Morrissey 0-5, Gearóid Hegarty 0-3, Peter Casey 0-2, Cathal O’Neill 0-2, Michael Casey 0-1, Diarmaid Byrnes 0-1, Cian Lynch 0-1, Shane O’Brien 0-1, David Reidy 0-1.

Title: Bitcoin Price Suddenly Soars As Congress Predicted To ‘Make History’

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 05/18 update below. This post was originally published on May 17 Bitcoin has been thrust back into the spotlight by extreme price swings this year, with U.S. president Donald Trump’s assault on the global trade order resulting in wild predictions of total U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has reclaimed $100,000 per bitcoin, topping the closely-watched level even as BlackRock quietly issues a stark bitcoin warning. Now, as crypto traders brace for a perfect storm to hit the bitcoin price, JPMorgan analysts have flipped from gold to bitcoin, predicting the bitcoin price will outperform gold over the rest of 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon remains skeptical of bitcoin and crypto despite the bitcoin ... More price boom over the last few years. "Between mid-February and mid-April gold was rising at the expense of bitcoin, while of the past three weeks we have been observing the opposite, i.e. bitcoin rising at the expense of gold," JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note seen by Decrypt. "In all, we expect the year-to-date zero sum game between gold and bitcoin to extend to the remainder of the year, but are biased towards crypto-specific catalysts creating more upside for bitcoin over gold into the second half of the year." Those "crypto-specific catalysts" include the passage of pro-crypto laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as Trump’s support of the technology. Elsewhere, Wall Street and tech giants are quietly gearing up to blow up the crypto market. 05/18 update: A U.S. bill that would regulate stablecoin issuers, formerly introducing crypto into the established financial system, will be debated by Congress this coming week, with some claiming it’s poised to pass the Senate. The bitcoin price surged to $106,000 per bitcoin on Sunday, climbing to a level not seen since early February and putting it in touching distance of its all-time high of almost $110,000. “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins,” Republican senator Bill Hagerty from Tennessee, who sponsored the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act, said in a statement. After Democrats raised eleventh hour concerns over the bill earlier this month that stemmed from U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration’s links to the crypto world, the bill has been redrafted to satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements, according to a copy seen by Coindesk. “Let’s get this home, we are ready for adoption and to revolutionise the way this financial market works,” Bo Hines, executive director of the president’s council of advisors for digital assets, said during the Consensus crypto conference this week. “We’re actually having these conversations in real-time—I’m extremely confident in the fact that they will get it pushed through, we’d love to see it on the president’s desk. We’re well on our way to achieving the presidents’ goal. We are moving extremely quickly and effectively.” Crypto companies have long been calling for regulation, with Congress under president Joe Biden trying and failing to get rules for stablecoins and issuers passed into law. "The industry wants regulation," investor Ira Auerbach from Offchain Labs said in emailed comments. “The message from those I engage with is clear: Give us the rules of the game and watch innovation flourish.” In April, the JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin’s burgeoning reputation as “digital gold" was under pressure as the bitcoin price failed to hold up in the face extreme market volatility triggered by Trump’s global trade war. The bitcoin price plummeted to around $75,000 per bitcoin, dropping over 30% from its all-time high of almost $110,000, as traders panicked over Trump’s tariffs but has since bounced back to over $100,000. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... More predictions. Bitcoin price bulls have remained upbeat, however, with Miller Value Partners chief investment officer and chairman, Bill Miller IV, telling CNBC the bitcoin price will keep climbing until it eclipses gold’s $20 trillion market capitalization. “Bitcoin’s back in the six-figures with a lot of room to go. If you compare its primary functional use case, a check and a balance on the lack of accountability in fiat unit creation, we still have a long way to go,” Miller said, predicting bitcoin’s “functional superiority” will push it to a price of $1 million per bitcoin. The gold price has hit its own record high this year as investors flee to the traditional safe haven, though it has dipped in recent weeks as the global trade war looks increasingly close to being resolved. With bitcoin’s market capitalization “back above $2 trillion and gold trading north of $3,200/oz, the two now stand side-by-side—as hedges against geopolitical turmoil and, increasingly, as high-conviction stores of value for the future,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

Register | Sign in Latest News Current Drivers Current Teams Current Circuits Latest Galleries Gallery Categories NEWS STORY18/05/2025 Today's race - probably the last at this iconic track, unless, God (and the WEF, Bill Gates, Blackrock etc.) willing, there is another pandemic - can go one of several ways. It could be decided at the first corner, or certainly on the opening lap, and then become one long DRS train, or it could be a genuine thriller. The Weather Gods are not going to be playing a part, which leaves it down to tyres, pit stop strategy and good old grit and determination. We know from experience that neither Oscar nor Max is prepared to give an inch, so the opening lap will be vital, however with the likes of Russell, Norris, Alonso Sainz, Albon and Hadjar in close proximity there should be added drama from the outset. Then we have the frustrated Ferraris, not to mention an equally fired-up Antonelli. A one-stop is the most viable choice, in part because there is only one DRS zone and also because this is the longest pit lane of the season in terms of time lost during a pit stop. The combination of medium and hard, with a stop between laps 17 and 23, is the most likely. However, as an alternative, some drivers might prefer to go for a longer first stint, starting on the hard, in the hope of an eventual Safety Car, in which case the switch to medium would be between laps 37 and 43. A two-stop strategy is not out of the question in terms of total race time, but the factors just mentioned mean it is at a disadvantage. For anyone attempting this, the best combinations would be medium-hard-hard." Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen and Antonelli all have one set of fresh mediums available, while, of those mentioned, Norris has one set of fresh hards while the rest have two. As for the soft - the infamous C6s - we are not going to see them again today, indeed the drivers would be happy never to see them again such were the issues they had with them yesterday. Despite the drama of Q2 and Q3, Aston Martin insists that its qualifying positions are not purely down to tyre choice but also the raft of upgrades brought here. Hopefully, Alonso and Stroll can use their positions, and the limitations of the Imola track, to convert their grid spots into a decent points haul. The Spaniard is always 'up for it', consequently it has been disappointing to see his frustration this season. Yesterday proved he still has fire in his belly, and given the equipment can still do the business. The Williams pair have looked strong all weekend, and it is good to see Sainz finding his feet, and while the Grove outfit should be in for some decent points there is still a long, long way to go before we can start thinking podiums. Having looked so strong on Friday, Gasly fell away somewhat yesterday, but he should give a good account of himself today, though Hadjar and Stroll will be keen to thwart him. The drama of the front rows aside, the real drama this afternoon should come from behind what with the Ferraris, Hamilton, Colapinto and Tsunoda. Having harangued Jack Doohan since before the season even began, Colapinto's 'fans' have now turned their attention elsewhere, giving poor old Tsunoda grief after the Red Bull driver gesticulated after being impeded by the Alpine. The Argentine has spoken out at the abuse levelled at Tsunoda - much of it racist - but sadly that appears to be the sort of demographic the sport is attracting these days. Despite his excellent debut last year Colapinto was subsequently involved in far too many crashes - costing Williams a small fortune - however this appears to have been overlooked amidst the anticipation of taking Doohan's seat. Yesterday he picked up where he left off, consequently the doubts over his potential remain. Already condemned to the back of the grid, a complete new engine change means that poor old Yuki will start from the pitlane. Colap;into drops one place after he entered the fast lane in the pit lane before the re-start time was confirmed. Talking of qualifying, Haas is still arguing over the fact that Bearman's final Q1 lap was disallowed, though it is unlikely that the stewards will change their mind, and even if they do, what can be done about it? With only one stop looking likely, not to mention the sole DRS zone and the fact that overtaking is nigh impossible, other than tyre choice it is the pit stop strategy that could be a decider today, so it is going to be fascinating to watch for the undercuts and overcuts. In the minutes before the pitlane opens, there is drama in the Williams garage where a leak has been detected on Albon's car. It's unclear what sort of leak it is so the car is being stripped down. The pitlane opens and Verstappen is first out, followed by Hulkenberg, Hadjar, Sainz and Lawson. Air temperature is 24 degrees C, while the track temperature is 46 degrees. It is bright and sunny. That said, Race Control says there is a 20% chance of rain. While Albon's car is sorted and the Thai driver takes his place on the grid, there is activity at the rear of Russell's Mercedes. All are starting on mediums bar Hamilton, Antonelli, Hulkenberg, Bearman and Tsunoda. Fresh rubber for all bar Russell, Alonso and Stroll. They head off on the formation lap, all getting away cleanly. The grid forms. They're away! Piastri gets away well, as does Russell right behind, but Verstappen is slow off the line and as they take the kink that is Turn 1 the Red Bull and Mercedes are side-by-side. However, heading into Tamburello Verstappen starts to brake early and having left Russell for dead clearly catches Piastri on the hop and is through to take the lead. A brilliant move by the world champion. "Piastri, what is he doing," asks a frustrated Russell who is boxed in behind the McLaren as Verstappen forges ahead. At the end of Lap 1, it's: Verstappen, Piastri, Russell, Norris, Alonso, Sainz, Albon, Stroll, Gasly and Leclerc. Hamilton is down to thirteenth and Antonelli up to twelfth. Ocon pits for hard tyres. Hamilton and Antonelli are side-by-side as they battle for 12th, while Gasly goes off and into the gravel at Turn 10 as he battles Leclerc. The Frenchman drops to 14th. After 3 laps Verstappen is 1.4s clear of Piastri as Leclerc closes on Stroll. As Russell remains 2.4s down on Piastri a DRS train consisting of nine cars forms behind the Mercedes. Sainz is harrying countryman Alonso as Hamilton is all over Antonelli further back. At the start of Lap 9, Norris tries a Verstappen on Russell, but is unable to pull it off. "I'm not sure how I'm going to make it to the target lap, pushing like this," admits Russell. In his determination to pass the Mercedes, Norris has two wheels on the grass. "He just drove on the grass," says a surprised Russell. As the pair continue to battle, Alonso and Sainz close in. Finally, following a little mistake by Russell, Norris passes the Mercedes as they head into Variante Villeneuve. Russell and Sainz both pit at the end of Lap 11, rejoining in 15th (Russell) and 16th. A two-stopper? Leclerc also pits, rejoining in 15th. "Plan A is very ambitious at the moment," says Piastri. Check out our Sunday gallery from Imola here. {pb] Alonso and Bortoleto pit at the end of Lap 12, as Leclerc posts a new fastest lap (20.505). The undercut has seen Leclerc pass Russell and Alonso. Replay shows flames from the front-left wheel on Alonso's car as he headed down the pitlane following his stop. Piastri pits at the end of Lap 13. An issue with the front-right sees the Australian rejoin in 12th, 4.9s ahead of Leclerc. Stroll pits at the end of Lap 14, as Hamilton is up to 6th. It's a slow stop for Stroll who rejoins in 17th. After 15 laps, it's: Verstappen, Norris, Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Hulkenberg, Colapinto and Bearman, though all have yet to stop. The leading car yet to stop is Tsunoda, who is 0.599s ahead of Piastri. The Japanese driver is told to do his best to hold him up. He tried, but to no avail, Piastri is through and seeks to make up the 32s gap to Verstappen. Having made short work of Bearman Piastri sets off after Colapinto. Out front, Verstappen leads Norris by 9.6s. As Piastri passes Colapinto, Tsunoda is battling a charging Leclerc. "The key for us is clean air and going long," Norris is told. "Albon 21.8, 21.8," Sainz is told as Leclerc passes Tsunoda for 11th. "There is no gap right now," Hamilton is told, "we are not ruling out Plan C." "Understood," he replies. Despite earlier fears the medium appears to be coming back. "It's like the rear track-rod or something is broken, the rears are moving," complains Russell. Colapinto pits at the end of Lap 22 and rejoins in 20tgh, as Piastri passes Hulkenberg for seventh. As Hamilton continues to harry Antonelli, Piastri closes on the pair. On Lap 26, Piastri passes Hamilton in Tamburello, the Briton offering no resistance. The Australian subsequently repeats the move on Antonelli, as he sets off after Hadjar, who can do Verstappen some good if he can hold off the McLaren. Piastri passes the RB to claim fourth, leaving him 32s down on Verstappen. Norris pits at the end of Lap 28, rejoining in seventh ahead of Leclerc. The VSC is deployed as Ocon has stopped on track. Verstappen pits as do Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton and a whole load of others. "Unbelievable, unbelievable," complains Leclerc at the turn of events. While a one-stopped played to his advantage, this has wrecked his race. As the dust settles, Verstappen leads Norris, Albon, Piastri, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Alonso, Stroll and Leclerc. Russell is down to twelfth. The VSC is withdrawn and as Leclerc tries to catch Stroll napping, Verstappen leads Norris by 19.9s. Replay shows a possible unsafe release for Antonelli. Norris post a new fastest lap (19.816), as Piastri hunts down Albon. Unseen, Leclerc has passes both Aston Martins, while Sainz has passed Tsunoda for 13th. Hamilton finally passes Antonelli in Tamburello to claim 6th, as the stewards have noted Tsunoda for causing a potential collision with Sainz. Russell passes Stroll and immediately closes on the other Aston Martin as Hamilton posts a new fastest lap (19.473). The crowd roars as Hamilton sweeps by Hadjar to claim fifth, the VSC having played out perfectly for the seven-time world champion. Now 18.7s ahead of Norris, Verstappen is leaving the opposition for dead. In fifth, Hamilton is the leading driver on the faster medium tyres. "I had to use a lot of tyres to get through those two," says Hamilton when told he is up to P5. Meanwhile, teammate Leclerc passes Antonelli for 7th. Hulkenberg passes Alonso for tenth as Tsunoda passes the other Aston Martin for 13th. Leclerc passes Hadjar to claim 6th, leaving him 2s down on his teammate. However, this raises the question of whether on hards, while his teammate is on mediums, will team orders come into play again? Sainz passes Hulkenberg for tenth as Tsunoda passes Alonso for 12th. "I'm the unluckiest ******* driver in the world," sighs Alonso. "It's going to be torture," he adds, knowing that he is destined to slip further down the order. "Swap the positions," Colapinto is told. He duly obliges, allowing Gasly through to take 15th. "I've got an issue," says Antonelli as he pulls to the side of the track on Lap 46. The Safety Car is deployed. Verstappen pits, taking full advantage of the freebie, as Norris follows suit. "We need to stay out, we don't have a tyre to last until the end," Leclerc is told. Hamilton and Hadjar pit as Norris rejoins behind his McLaren teammate. Hamilton rejoins in 7th, as Alonso and Stroll pit, along with Colapinto and Bortoleto. Next time around Albon pits, the Thai driver rejoining in fifth. As Piastri closes to within 1.8s of Verstappen - on 18 lap old rubber - they are taking their time in removing Piastri's car. With Norris on fresher rubber, McLaren is going to have to make a tough decision over the course of the remaining laps. Behind the Safety Car it's: Verstappen, Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Albon, Russell, Hamilton, Sainz, Hadjar and Hulkenberg. "I see tyres are pretty dead," says Norris. "I'm not asking to be let by, I'm just saying." "These tyres are going to be incredibly difficult to restart," warns Leclerc. With 11 laps remaining, Bearman is told he can un-lap himself, which should take another lap or so. Piastri's tyres are 21 laps old, Leclerc and Russell's 22 laps. The Safety Car is withdrawn at the end of Lap 53. Verstappen lets loose, and as Piastri follows Leclerc tries to make a move on Norris. Having failed, the Ferrari driver comes under attack from Albon. Check out our Sunday gallery from Imola here.

Oscar got done over by Verstappen and it was very much a catch me if you can exercise from there on. It peed me right off but that's racing. What were McLaren thinking pitting Piastri on lap 12. To my mind that was a disaster just waiting to be played out...as it certainly did. Must admit though that Oscar scything through the field was really great to watch.In the end Norris's plaintive pleading to be let by wasn't missed despite Norris claiming he was just making an observation!!! Fortunately the team were not about to risk it and he had to make a pass on merit, on newer rubber which was easier for the team to defend, The race exceeded expectations and Imola is a far nicer environment to hold a race. All I'm hoping for now is for Piastri to get a pole position in Monaco and do the business. That will make the run down to the first corner something to behold."

As is now usually the case the rest of the race was all about tyres & DRS.If Max had got clear he was always going to win. Once ahead the Red Bull's tyre heating\deg issues are nullified. The Red Bull is every bit as fast (in clean air) as the McLaren: its performance in Qualifying attests this. As a side issue it seems that Max is still the only driver who can come to terms with his RBR car. If RBR want to win any Team gongs they need to address this problem. Even if Max were to win every race, McLaren, Mercedes or even Ferrari, who all have two drivers able to extract decent performance from their car, stand a chance of winning the Team Championship. All the driver championship delivers is a bigger pay-packet for the driver of the Team's car...." Rating: Positive (1) Rate comment: Positive | NegativeReport this comment 5.

Only those cars with damage or punctures should be allowed into the pits. If tyres are changed during a safety car they should be of the same type (red for red). Any car with changed tyres under a safety car must stop and change the tyres on the lap after the safety car has pulled into the pits. All a safety car will do is bunch the cars. Much better than the farce we have now. " Rating: Negative (-2) Rate comment: Positive | NegativeReport this comment 12.

A portfolio manager, she spent more than a decade at BlackRock, where her duties included trading risk-off assets like government bonds. But, in 2021, Thornton’s career took a sharp turn—she left her post at the world’s largest asset manager and entered the world of Web3. "There's just a lot of opportunities here," Thornton said of the crypto industry. That's particularly true for women, she added, despite the fact that the space's ranks are overwhelmingly dominated by males. "It's exciting," Thornton said. "People [are] coming from other industries, bringing their knowledge, bringing their skills, and applying them in this new way on this new asset class." Now, she spends her days in the crypto trenches, trading tokens like Bitcoin and one-of-one monkey jpegs —two emerging asset classes that lie at the opposite end of the risk spectrum compared to the financial instruments she traded during her traditional finance days. “When I'm working from home, my kids will kind of walk by my desk, and then they'll stop in their tracks and ask, ‘Mom, what are you doing?’” Thornton told Decrypt. “I'm like, ‘Oh, well, these are the Pudgy Penguins, and these are the Lil Pudgys,’” she said, explaining that the people in her life often seem mystified by her work. Her mother, she added, “thinks I work for Bitcoin.” (She does not.) Thornton is a senior index fund portfolio manager at Bitwise, a crypto-focused asset manager founded in 2017 that offers its clients a variety of investment vehicles, from crypto index funds to ETFs and private funds. As part of her role at the company, Thornton is responsible for implementing investment strategies across a large swath of portfolios—much like she did in her TradFi days. But, she also contributes to managing such unconventional funds as the Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index Fund, which targets a decisively more crypto-native crowd. “Where I am, and like so much of what I do really, is at that intersection of the two spaces,” Thornton told Decrypt. Thornton is one of a growing number of traditional finance professionals who are flocking to the crypto industry as institutions increasingly embrace the asset class, and lawmakers clear a path toward reducing federal regulatory oversight of the industry, encouraging its growth in the U.S. Although current employment data on the crypto industry is scant, a report from digital assets-focused research firm K33 Research shows that 199,000 people held jobs in the industry as of 2023, with the majority of those employees working for exchanges and brokerages or crypto-focused financial firms. That tally is small compared to the more than 6 million people who were employed in the finance and insurance sectors that same year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But now, as a growing number of institutions, states, and public companies invests in the asset class, elevating the price of Bitcoin back near its all-time high above $108,000 set in January, some experts say the crypto industry is poised to attract even more talent from more traditional employment sectors. A recent report from the World Economic Forum shows that over 10% of global GDP could be stored on blockchain by the end of 2025—a marked increase in blockchain use that could spur cross-industry hiring into Web3, according to crypto-focused recruitment services firm RecruitBlock. As Web3 and traditional finance become increasingly enmeshed, it's people like Thornton who will continue to close the gap between those worlds. Thornton said the differences between the emerging tech and traditional finance worlds can, at times, be stark. Crypto markets, unlike regular markets, never close. And whereas TradFi systems “usually have maybe two decimal places on a share quantity,” cryptocurrencies can go out to eight or 12 decimal places. Those differences inform Thornton and her colleagues’ work to manage crypto-focused portfolios much in the same way they used to manage TradFi portfolios, with an aim to create balance, reduce slippage, and tighten market exposure. “When you trade an asset with a price as large as Bitcoin, it matters if you're trading 10.48 or 10.483527397—and you have to get that level of precision,” Thornton said. “They hired me at Bitwise to manage the funds with the same level of precision and rigor and professionalism that we did at BlackRock.” Asked if she feels the gap between the professionalism that guides interactions in the TradFi world and the somewhat cultish espirit de corps of the Crypto Twitter (aka X) trenches, Thornton said, “I'm more of a lurker, to tell you the truth.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: How Dell is riding the AI wave while serving its massive installed base

UPDATED 13:38 EDT / MAY 17 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Dell Technologies Inc.’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under-appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, founder Michael Dell (pictured) always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman who literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Dell Technologies World 2025 in Las Vegas, we examine the question of how will Dell capture the explosive artificial intelligence opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, storage arrays and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? We believe Dell’s ability to stay out in front hinges on three imperatives, including: 1) Doubling down on full-stack “AI factory” systems that collapse infrastructure silos and accelerate time-to-AI value; 2) Unlock the latent power of its massive global channel — treating 200,000-plus partners as an extension of the direct engine rather than a bolt-on; and 3) Modernizing the core — that is, redesigning servers, storage and networking for highly parallel, power-hungry workloads while relentlessly driving down cost per floating-point operation and attacking the energy footprint customers now scrutinize. Below we show a chart Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke unveiled at Dell’s 2023 Financial Analyst Meeting in October 2023. The image depicts a time-series line that surges through key milestones in tech. We see in the 1990s the direct-to-consumer PC model takes off, then accelerates again in the early internet era when e-commerce turbocharges that same motion. Around the early 2010s the curve flattens — then dips — illustrating Dell’s struggle to morph into an enterprise powerhouse, jettisoning its relationship with EMC and moving forward on its own with 30-plus acquisitions such as Compellent, EqualLogic, Boomi, Perot Systems and many more, including several software assets. This ultimately proved to be an expensive learning exercise. The line rebounds sharply post-2016 after the EMC deal, peaks with the VMware stake, and now turns upward again as Dell positions itself squarely in the AI wave. In our view the slide is more than a history lesson; it’s a roadmap. Dell’s strategic pivots — private-equity reset, EMC megamerger and VMware monetization — set the stage for the current AI cycle. The task now is to translate that hard-won enterprise footing into end-to-end AI factories, monetized via a revitalized channel and powered by infrastructure that balances performance with energy pragmatism and an enticing value proposition for enterprise customers, relative to hyperscalers. Dell’s equity story aligns with the market’s awakening to generative AI. The five-year stock chart shown below highlights January 2023 with the shares at around $40 — valued well under one times sales. Visually, the chart shows a long flat-to-slightly-down channel from 2020 through 2022, a sharp diagonal ascent beginning Q1 ’23, an acceleration post-Analyst Day, and a gentle step-down to the current level — essentially a classic hype-cycle “installed base” plateau. AI is only half the story, perhaps even less. Dell returns ~80 % of free cash flow to shareholders, Michael Dell included, through repurchases and dividends. That framework resonates with value-oriented funds that previously ignored the name. The flip side, of course, is that sizable buybacks imply management sees limited return on investment in incremental R&D or M&A. Whether that tradeoff is sustainable as AI factories scale will be a key watch-point in upcoming quarters. Dell’s strategy appears to be focus on keeping costs down, making structural changes internally, applying AI to improve efficiencies and driving EBITDA and cash flow through the roof. As we said, it’s not sexy, but it’s lucrative. The slide below from Dell’s financial reporting distills the company’s P&L into two main vectors comprising the bulk of its nearly $100 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2025. The business is split almost evenly between its two reporting segments. In our view, the elegance of this structure is strategic. By preserving the PC volume HP jettisoned after its split, Dell keeps purchase-order muscle that wrings pennies out of every component across the stack. That flywheel lowers unit costs for ISG. Moreover, it allows Dell to claim true “end-to-end” status while competitors assemble piecemeal. During the early phases of the pandemic, an unprecedented surge in remote-work and at-home learning catalyzed a sharp spike in PC demand. Unit shipments soared, propelling Dell’s top-line revenue to record levels. However, the mix leaned heavily toward lower-margin notebooks. Because these volumes carried thinner product margins and added supply chain costs, the very growth that buoyed revenue simultaneously compressed gross margin, underscoring how a skew toward less profitable products can dilute profitability even in boom times. Today, the center of gravity has shifted to AI-optimized servers within the Infrastructure Solutions Group. Enterprises and service providers racing to deploy large language model and inference workloads are prioritizing GPU-dense systems with far higher average selling prices and margins. This mix enrichment somewhat offsets Nvidia’s higher silicon vig in each configuration. Consequently, margin expansion is visible despite the absolute dollar outlay for GPUs, illustrating the leverage that premium configurations bring when demand is both urgent and price-insensitive. Storage mix further accentuates this benefit as Dell controls more of the IP. Looking ahead, we believe the next catalyst will come from a broad-based storage refresh cycle. All-flash arrays shipped in the 2018-2020 window are hitting warranty expiration just as new AI-centric storage architectures – featuring graphics processing unit-direct fabrics, parallel file systems, object stores and greater AI affinity, combined with ultra-low-latency networking embedded into servers — enter mainstream availability. As customers migrate to these higher-value, high-capacity systems, the shift promises a second-order margin tailwind. In our view, the combination of richer storage average selling prices and recurring software licensing tied to data-services will fortify gross margin even further, extending the profitability uplift that began with today’s AI-server boom. VMware hitting Dell’s P&L once addressed Dell’s software deficiency, but the Broadcom divestiture leaves a hardware-centric portfolio. Management chose liquidity and balance-sheet clarity over folding VMware in and inflating margin optics. The explicit bet Dell is making in our view is that its supply chain scale combined with AI factories will allow the company to compete on value against the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Amazon Web Services Inc. In our opinion, Dell’s ~$100 billion hardware flywheel is both its moat and its challenge. Though the company has unmatched procurement leverage on one hand, it faces constant pressure to innovate at wafer-thin PC margins while chasing higher-value enterprise workloads. As much as we would have loved to see a VMware “spin in,” the company appears comfortable with and well-suited to pursue its current model and navigate the challenge. Above we show a comparative table of five tech incumbents — Dell, HPE, IBM Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp. — arrayed left-to-right starting with Dell, then ascending by revenue multiple. The rows list trailing-12-month revenue, gross margin, operating margin, operating cash flow dollars, OCF as a percentage of revenue, approximate market cap as of yesterday, and the resulting revenue multiple. In our opinion, Dell’s capital-return story and AI server uptick have closed part of the valuation gap, but the table tells a clear story – i.e. hardware scale alone makes it difficult to crack the 1x sales valuation ceiling. To earn a software-style multiple, Dell must: 1) Embed higher-margin intellectual property deeper into its AI factory stack; 2) Find a software engine it can keep this time; or 3) Massively automate with AI, cutting internal costs and driving unprecedented productivity by applying agents to redesign processes. We believe the third option carries low risk and is well underway. This in and of itself should provide a mid-term valuation boost. It remains unclear whether Dell will tap either or both of the other two options to trade at a higher multiple relative to peers. The slide below pulls from Enterprise Technology Research’s quarterly TSIS survey and plots Net Score — the firm’s composite metric for spending velocity — across five Dell categories: Laptops, Cloud Computing (read: private-cloud spend), Storage, Servers and Desktops. Three data points appear for each line — April ’24, January ’25 and April ’25 — letting us track budget sentiment over the past year. How to read the graphic Key observations We believe the survey reinforces Dell’s mixed reality. That is to say, macro belt-tightening is tamping down momentum, yet the PC franchise still outperforms and the private-cloud narrative resonates with a smaller but meaningful subset of buyers. The net effect is muted, not collapsing, which sets the stage for an AI-driven refresh cycle to re-accelerate infrastructure spend when and if budgets loosen. The slide below takes the same ETR dataset but switches the y-axis from Net Score to Pervasion — the percentage of survey respondents that cite Dell as a current supplier in each category. A red box highlights the metric and the bars immediately show how deeply embedded Dell is across the enterprise landscape, with the exception of cloud. Visually, the bars for laptops and servers extend above the 50% line, storage and desktops cluster just below 40%, and cloud computing trails in the low teens. What the numbers tell us We believe these pervasion stats highlight Dell’s greatest strategic asset – that is, a vast, sticky installed base it can mine for AI-factory upgrades and cross-portfolio pull-through. The challenge — and opportunity — is converting that legacy footprint into next-gen infrastructure before subscription-heavy rivals poach the refresh cycles. The next slide below is a two-axis scatter plot drawn from the same ETR dataset: A dashed horizontal line at 40% highlights the “elevated-momentum” threshold; no hardware vendor breaches that bar in this cut, underscoring the budget drag we discussed earlier and the maturity of this market. Our research indicates that Dell’s commercial laptop line enjoys best-in-class velocity and the broadest footprint, a combination rarely achieved in mature categories. That leadership not only sustains the company’s supply-chain economy of scale but also gives Dell a privileged entry point to upsell edge AI workflows and back-end infrastructure as customers modernize their fleets. The data below is another ETR scatter plot — Shared Net Score on the vertical axis, Penetration (Overlap) on the horizontal — this time comparing server vendors. The dashed red line at 40% again marks the “high-momentum” threshold. The slide below shows the ETR storage scatter, again plotting Shared Net Score (spending momentum) on the vertical axis and Penetration (Overlap) on the horizontal. Remember, ETR lumps primary storage and data-protection arrays into one category, so the field mixes old-guard storage area network vendors with next-gen and legacy backup platforms. In our view, Dell’s strategy is clear: Leverage its unparalleled storage footprint to seed AI-ready infrastructure upgrades, continue to update the portfolio with AI optimized storage (parallel file systems, high performance, disaggregated systems); and then rely on tight partnerships and full-stack integration to reignite the momentum currently captured by more specialized rivals. Our research indicates AI is not merely an incremental workload; it is redefining the entire data-center stack. The graphic below is our April 2025 update to the long-range data-center infrastructure forecast covering facilities, power, cooling, servers, storage and networking. A key marker highlights total spend topping $1 trillion in the early 2030s. In our view, the takeaway is stark – that is, every dollar of traditional x86 spend that flatlines must be replaced, or exceeded, by GPU-dense architectures. Suppliers that master power, cooling and supply-chain economics for AI factories will ride this trillion-dollar wave; those clinging to CPU-only designs risk shrinking into the gray band that barely registers on the forecast by decade’s end. IBM’s Z will survive this transition and x86 will continue to have its place, but the days of dominance for general-purpose architectures are over. The chart below strips out non-AI workloads and isolates annual AI infrastructure outlays through 2035. Two stacked areas tell the story: Note: overall AI infrastructure surpassing the trillion-dollar mark early next decade. We believe Dell is engineering squarely for the AI crossover: In our opinion, hyperscalers will continue to set the early pace, but the battleground for the next decade is enterprise AI. Dell’s strategy — “modernize what you have while layering in what you need for AI” — positions the company to capture that second-wave demand when the forecast says on-prem AI spend overtakes legacy infrastructure. We expect Dell to emphasize heavy dose of AI PC messaging — hopefully some new adoption metrics, refreshed form factors and a deeper dive on the neural processing unit roadmap. Apple’s early M-series momentum has stoked plenty of chatter around on-device inference; Dell must now prove its AI-chip-plus-NPU strategy can deliver comparable battery life, latency and developer traction. Expect Dell to bombard attendees with server, storage, and “AI factory” SKUs — an options portfolio that illustrates its core value proposition: customer choice at global scale. We believe the headline themes will be: Dell’s cadence has become predictable: Announce a “Project” one spring, ship the SKU the next. Alpine, Frontier, Fort Knox, Fort Zero, Helix — each followed that pattern. Customers have learned they can scope budgets a year out, but history also shows some projects fade quietly. Caveat emptor: Watch which previous code names and which 2025 “projects” receive firm ship dates versus “tech preview” language. Dell services has taken on an expanded role in this AI era. Dell recognizes that many customers not only lack an on-prem AI stack but they lack the skills necessary to move fast. Dell Consulting acts as an important accelerant to help customers navigate data quality challenges and governance and privacy concerns; and build solutions that can fit into existing legacy infrastructure while at the same time helping firms lean into the AI opportunity. Expect services and consulting to be prominently on display at DTW 2025 from laptops to the top of the stack and into managed services. Our analysis flags four areas that could challenge Dell’s AI ambitions: In our view Dell’s differentiation will not come from boasting the fastest GPU node — everyone will hit spec-sheet parity within quarters. The real test is whether Dell can orchestrate an end-to-end AI factory that stitches racks, storage, fabrics, software and services into a turnkey outcome, then deliver it through a channel that already owns the loading-dock badge at most enterprises. If Dell executes, it can harvest the cash flows of its mature PC and server franchises while expanding wallet share with AI-ready systems for the next decade. The pivot hinges on the following key question: Can those AI factories leap from Tier-2 and Tier-3 service providers into mainstream enterprise halls before cloud vendors lock in the market? We’ll be on the ground with theCUBE all week to test that thesis—and will report back in Breaking Analysis as the story unfolds.

Title: Big Short’s Michael Burry Abruptly Sells Everything – Except for One ‘Recession-Proof’ Asset

“Big Short” hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 collapse of the housing market, just initiated a major portfolio shakeup. New SEC filings from Burry’s Scion Asset Management show the firm has taken a substantial bearish stance against Nvidia (NVDA), opening a large position in put options against the chipmaker’s stock. Scion has also reversed its previously bullish outlook on Chinese equities. The fund acquired bearish put options on major Chinese companies, including Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU). And here’s the twist – Scion’s only remaining long position is in New York-based Estee Lauder (EL), a bet on the cosmetics giant’s potential recovery. This solitary bullish stance underscores Burry’s cautious approach on the market, with the makeup industry often believed to be resilient to recession. This is the second time in recent years that Burry has gutted Scion’s portfolio. In 2023, Burry drastically reduced Scion’s holdings, only to later admit he was wrong while placing new, targeted bets.

Title: Silicon Valley's era of open debate fades as companies clamp down on employee dissent

Through the looking glass: As the tech industry continues to tighten control over employee speech and activism, a culture once defined by open dialogue and political engagement gives way to one marked by silence and fear of reprisal. "It's different now; employers feel they can get away with stuff," said a former Google employee. In recent years, Silicon Valley has witnessed a sharp shift in how major technology companies respond to employee activism and internal dissent. Once known for a culture encouraging open debate and political engagement, the tech industry is now cracking down on workers who challenge company policies or voice concerns about controversial business practices. Last month, two employees who interrupted an event with founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella to protest Microsoft's involvement in the Israel-Gaza war were quickly fired. Five years ago, by contrast, Microsoft divested from an Israeli facial recognition startup suspected of surveilling Palestinian citizens, partly in response to internal pressure. Also read: Microsoft fires engineers over AI protest at 50th-anniversary event This incident is part of a larger trend in the industry. Across the tech sector, companies are increasingly rejecting worker petitions, terminating employees who organize protests, and deleting critical posts from internal forums. Internet platforms have also warned against leaking information to the media, and some workers have lost their jobs as a result. Other policies have been implemented to prevent employees from contacting regulators. Last year, some OpenAI employees filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that the company's restrictive agreements prevented staff from warning regulators about AI safety risks. At the same time, the tech labor market has undergone dramatic changes, as mass layoffs, once rare among tech giants, have become increasingly routine. Since 2023, more than half a million tech jobs have been cut, according to Layoffs.fyi. This month, Microsoft announced a 3 percent reduction in its global workforce, following similar moves by Meta and Intel. The crackdown on dissent has intensified during the presidency of Donald Trump. Executives at Google, Meta, and Amazon contributed millions to Trump's inauguration committee and have engaged with the White House in private meetings. Many companies have also introduced policies that align with the administration's agenda, such as eliminating diversity initiatives and reversing longstanding content moderation practices. These changes might once have sparked significant activism among Silicon Valley's traditionally liberal workforce. However, aggressive management tactics and a weak job market have dampened employees' willingness to speak out. "A decade ago, employees would discuss controversial political issues out in the open and on employee message boards and at all-hands meetings," said Nu Wexler, a communications consultant with experience at Google, Twitter, and Meta. Now, "the companies have either strongly discouraged that or banned it." These tactics are having their intended effect. After Google announced in February that it would no longer avoid using AI for weapons or surveillance, internal message boards remained largely silent, a stark contrast to seven years ago when thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to cancel a Pentagon contract for AI-powered drone analysis. Employees, though, have not gone completely silent. A group called No Azure for Apartheid was launched and is led by current and former Microsoft employees who are protesting the company's business dealings with the Israeli military and government. It is holding a protest this weekend. However, Microsoft has come down hard on employees participating in such protests during company time. Microsoft fired at least five employees who protested during a town hall with CEO Satya Nadella. The workers, wearing T-shirts that read "Does Our Code Kill Kids, Satya?" were part of No Azure for Apartheid. Google, too, fired more than 50 employees last year after protests against its cloud-computing deal with the Israeli government. CEO Sundar Pichai had previously warned employees not to use the company as a "personal platform" or to "fight over disruptive issues or debate politics."

Title: Short Washington DC And Go Long Seattle: Three Stocks To Buy Now

ByRobert Daugherty ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Moody's lowered the sovereign credit rating of the US, joining S&P and Fitch in stripping America's AAA status. While this is historic and will attract media attention, it reveals what has long been the Federal government's poor governance and management. Spending more than it collects in taxes and lacking the courage to make difficult decisions and think long term. The current administration is admirably trying to right the financial ship. However, its on-again, off-again tariffs will never collect the intended revenue. Additionally, its proposed tax reductions come without corresponding serious spending cuts or addressing entitlement payments. While the Federal government operates under different constraints than states, a comparative fiscal analysis proves instructive. Washington State's prudent financial governance stands in stark contrast to Washington DC's struggle with fiscal discipline. The state maintains exemplary creditworthiness through constitutional balanced budget requirements and strategic reserve mechanisms that have earned it high ratings from credit agencies—precisely the credentials the federal government has now lost. Washington State's economic fundamentals further distinguish it: the state ranks among national leaders in both median household income and GDP per capita. As federal fiscal challenges mount under the weight of escalating debt, Washington State's diversified economy continues to thrive, powered by a formidable technology sector, robust job creation, and sustained investment in innovation that positions the region for continued long-term growth despite broader economic headwinds. Looking specifically at Washington state, one can imagine an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that would likely best the S&P 500 with names like Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Redfin (RDFN) and Weyerhaeuser (WY). For investors seeking above-average long-term equity returns, these value stocks are primed to deliver. There are three Seattle-based companies that are worth buying now: Nordstrom (ticker JWN), Starbucks (SBUX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK), all of which offer attractive long-term returns. Nordstrom represents one of Seattle's most iconic retail success stories. Founded in 1901, this luxury department store chain has built a reputation for exceptional customer service and premium merchandise. After facing headwinds in recent years from e-commerce competition and pandemic disruptions, Nordstrom is executing a compelling turnaround strategy focused on omnichannel integration and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division. The company's most recent quarterly earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, with stronger-than-anticipated same-store sales growth and improved margins. Nordstrom reports earnings on June 6th, so stay tuned to hear more about their turnaround plans. Despite the challenging retail environment created by the current administration's ADHD governance style which has whipsawed markets, Nordstrom remains on track to hit its 2025 guidance—no easy task in today's unpredictable economic landscape. The company's loyal, high-income customer base provides resilience during economic uncertainty. Nordstrom's digital investments are paying dividends with robust online growth, while its brick-and-mortar footprint remains strategically valuable in prime locations. The stock currently trades at attractive valuations compared to historical averages, suggesting significant upside potential as discretionary spending rebounds. Nordstrom's management team has demonstrated discipline in inventory management and cost controls while maintaining the premium shopping experience that differentiates the brand. Their focus on exclusive merchandise partnerships and personalized styling services creates competitive advantages that pure e-commerce players struggle to replicate. Seattle's global coffee empire is positioned for renewed growth after recent operational challenges. Starbucks' unmatched brand loyalty and extensive retail network of over 38,000 stores worldwide provide enormous competitive advantages. The company's strategic initiatives under new leadership are addressing operational inefficiencies while expanding digital capabilities and strengthening customer connections. Starbucks delivered a standout quarterly performance that surpassed analyst expectations across key metrics, including comparable store sales and operating margins. The company has projected $0.67 per share in the third quarter versus $0.41 per share in the second quarter. Despite navigating supply chain disruptions and consumer spending fluctuations caused by the administration's erratic policy shifts that have whipsawed markets, the company confidently reaffirmed its 2025 guidance—demonstrating remarkable operational discipline in an unpredictable environment. Starbucks continues to see strong international growth, particularly in China where the company is expanding its footprint despite near-term economic headwinds. The brand's ongoing menu innovation and premium positioning allow it to maintain pricing power even in inflationary environments. The company's rewards program boasts over 30 million active members in the U.S. alone, driving repeat business and higher average tickets. Recent stock price weakness presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, with the company's robust free cash flow supporting both dividend growth and share repurchases. Starbucks' dividend yield currently exceeds historical averages, providing income while investors wait for the growth initiatives to fully materialize. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 04: An Alaska Airlines plane takes off from Los Angeles ... More International Airport (LAX) on December 4, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Alaska Airlines has announced it plans to purchase rival Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal which must be approved by federal regulators. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) This Seattle-based airline has built a reputation for operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Alaska Air Group has successfully integrated Virgin America while expanding its routes and partnerships to create a more competitive national network. The carrier's strong presence along the West Coast positions it ideally to benefit from the region's economic dynamism and population growth. Alaska Air's quarterly results flew past expectations with impressive load factors and revenue per available seat mile, despite the turbulence created by volatile fuel prices and changing travel regulations. Alaska expects to earn $1.54 per share in the third quarter on $3.5 billion in revenue, up from $3.2 billion in the second quarter. The airline has skillfully navigated the unpredictable policy environment—characterized by the current administration's ADHD governance style that has whipsawed markets—and remains firmly on course to achieve its ambitious 2025 financial and operational targets. Alaska's fleet modernization program is improving fuel efficiency and reducing maintenance costs, strengthening its cost structure compared to legacy carriers. The company maintains one of the industry's strongest balance sheets with relatively low debt levels, providing financial flexibility to weather industry cyclicality and invest in growth opportunities. The airline's loyalty program and credit card partnerships generate high-margin revenue streams that complement its core operations. Alaska's management team has demonstrated disciplined capacity growth and pricing strategies that prioritize profitability over market share. Recent expansion into premium cabin offerings addresses higher-yield business travelers while maintaining its value proposition for leisure customers. SEATTLE, WA - (Photo by Donald Miralle/Getty Images ) These three companies exemplify the broader economic strengths of Washington state. While federal finances deteriorate, Seattle-based enterprises benefit from the state's fiscal discipline, educated workforce, and innovation ecosystem. Investors seeking refuge from national economic challenges would be wise to consider these Washington state stalwarts for their portfolios. Their combination of established market positions, turnaround potential, and exposure to the dynamic Pacific Northwest economy offers compelling long-term value.

Title: ELV SHAREHOLDER NEWS: Investors of Elevance Health, Inc. Securities are Reminded of the July 11 Class Action Deadline -- Contact BFA Law (NYSE:ELV)

May 17, 2025 07:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Bitcoin Is Headed To $1 Million Thanks To Increasingly Favorable Macro Tailwinds, Says Crypto Legend Hayes

Earlier this month, the price of Bitcoin smashed the $100,000 milestone for the first time since February as U.S. President Donald Trump teased a major trade deal. Now, Arthur Hayes is predicting that the apex crypto will rocket to $1 million in just three years, thanks to macro tailwinds. The former BitMEX CEO reiterated his uber-bullish forecast in his latest blog post. Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could surge to seven figures in a few years, owing to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury, suggesting that Bitcoin will become the preferred haven for investors everywhere. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of U.S. treasuries will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” the BitMEX founder said in his May 15 blog. Hayes timed his forecast to the next US presidential election when a less crypto-friendly president might assume office. “I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs, and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he wrote. “Maybe by some stroke of divine intervention, the American public is ready to accept the monetary hangover for the profligacy of the last century and extinguish the rotten credit destroying their society,” the crypto OG said. “Therefore, the time is now to make hay while the sun king takes a shine to Bitcoin.” Hayes, who was pardoned in late March by U.S. President Trump after having pleaded guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, went on to suggest that Trump will shift gears from tariffs to capital control. This will spook investors, who Hayes thinks will exit the United States with their capital. He reckons the US will print more money in a form similar to quantitative easing to make up for capital leaving the U.S. “It’s the same answer as always,” said Hayes. “If the foreigners won’t supply the dollars, the government will by using its printing press.” As a result, he believes President Trump is likely to shift policies, which will ultimately be a boon for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,” Hayes postulated. Hayes has often maintained that Bitcoin will end up taking off like a rocket due to the U.S.’s monetary policy of printing cash.
