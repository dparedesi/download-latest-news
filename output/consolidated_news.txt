Amazon Web Services (AMZN+2.09%) unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence training chip that it says is faster and expected to use less energy. Trainium3 is the first chip from AWS built with the 3-nanometer process — so far the most advanced semiconductor technology — that allows for better performance and power efficiency. The first Trainium3 chips are expected to be available late next year, AWS announced at its re:Invent conference on Tuesday. UltraServers powered with Trainium3 are expected to perform four times better than those powered by its Trainium2 chips, AWS said, “allowing customers to iterate even faster when building models and deliver superior real-time performance when deploying them.” The cloud giant’s Trainium2 chips, which are four times faster than its predecessor, are now generally available, AWS said. The Trainium2-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances allow for 30% to 40% better price performance than current chips, and feature 16 Trainium2 chips. The new Amazon EC2 instances are “ideal for training and deploying LLMs with billions of parameters,” AWS said. The cloud giant said it is building an EC2 UltraCluster of Trainium2-powered UltraServers with AI startup Anthropic called Project Rainier. In November, AWS announced it was following up a previous $4 billion investment in the AI startup with another $4 billion. In the next phase of the partnership, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary AI training partner. “Trainium2 is purpose built to support the largest, most cutting-edge generative AI workloads, for both training and inference, and to deliver the best price performance on AWS,” David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS, said in a statement. “With models approaching trillions of parameters, we understand customers also need a novel approach to train and run these massive workloads. New Trn2 UltraServers offer the fastest training and inference performance on AWS and help organizations of all sizes to train and deploy the world’s largest models faster and at a lower cost.” AWS chief executive Matt Garman also announced the next-generation P6 family of instances from Nvidia (NVDA+2.17%) and AWS, featuring the chipmaker’s new Blackwell chips. Blackwell has 2.5 times faster compute than current generation of graphics processing units, or GPUs, Garman said.

Title: Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger may get more than $10 million in severance pay

Time Published: 2024-12-03T16:26:00Z

Outgoing Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is set to get paid as much as $10 million as he exits the struggling tech giant. Gelsinger will receive 18 months of his base annual salary of $1.25 million, or $1.8 million, and 1.5 times his target bonus of $3.4 million, or $5.16 million, which will be paid out over the next 18 months, Intel (INTC-2.11%) said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Gelsinger will also receive a payment equal to 11/12ths of his 2024 bonus — which is subject to company performance — that he would have received had he not resigned. That would be a little more than $3 million. His departure comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA+2.17%) in the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest, including a potential takeover bid, as its performance has lagged. In early November, Intel was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to make room for Nvidia, which has been hailed as an “AI darling.” Intel’s stock has fallen by more than 52% in 2024 as of Tuesday, while its rival’s stock has surged by more than 188%. Although Gelsinger’s resignation was announced Monday morning, it came after what CNBC reports was a contentious board meeting over a lack of confidence in the CEO’s plans to compete with Nvidia. Gelsinger had served as the company’s first chief technical officer before leaving the company. He returned in 2021 to take over for then-CEO Bob Swan in an attempt to stabilize and modernize the company. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” he said.

Title: PlayStation Boss Says AI Can "Revolutionize" Gaming But The Human Element Remains Vital

Advancements to AI could play a key role in the gaming industry's future, Hermen Hulst says. By Eddie Makuch on December 3, 2024 at 8:45AM PST According to one of the top bosses at PlayStation, the rise in artificial intelligence technologies in game development has the potential to "revolutionize" gaming, but only as a tool that assists humans. "Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial," Hermen Hulst told the BBC. He went on to predict that the gaming industry will see a "dual demand," split between AI-driven "innovative experiences" and a second for "handcrafted, thoughtful content." There are concerns among industry developers about the potential for advancements to AI ending up taking jobs from humans. This is part of the reason why video game voice actors are now on strike and why some labor unions are calling on workers to organize. Another video game executive, Christoph Hartmann of Amazon, said he believes AI could replace "boring" parts of video game jobs, including localization as he sees it. However, Hartmann and others believe the rise in AI technologies will create enough new jobs to offset any potential job losses. EA's Andrew Wilson previously said the agricultural and industrial revolutions took many jobs but created countless more, and he sees an AI revolution following a similar playbook. The video game industry had another tough year in 2024 with thousands of worker layoffs, along with game cancellations and studio closures. A number of companies whose executives are speaking positively about AI--including Microsoft, EA, Amazon, and PlayStation--have all cut jobs in the past year. Whether or not these cuts were at all related to AI is unknown, however. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com Use your keyboard! Log in to comment

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks traded mixed on Tuesday as investors digested fresh jobs data and waited for new Fedspeak to cement or dent growing hopes for future interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hugged the flat line in late morning trade, coming off fresh records for the two gauges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) reversed earlier gains to fall roughly 0.4%. Job openings rose by 372,000 to 7.74 million in October compared to estimates of 7.52 million, according to BLS data released on Tuesday. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed fewer hires were made during the month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, rose to 2.1% from 1.9% in September. JOLTS serves as the first in a wave of key data this week that culminates in Friday's all-important monthly US payrolls report. Traders are now pricing in about a 69% chance that the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point at its Dec. 18 meeting, compared with 62% a day ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Those odds could shift after Fed policymakers Austan Goolsbee and Adriana Kugler appear later on Tuesday, which set the stage for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's panel discussion on Wednesday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped in early trading after shipments of the EV maker's China-built models fell again, putting sales targets in doubt. In addition, CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay deal was rejected again by a judge. Meanwhile, shares in US Steel (X) fell about 8% on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump's promise to "block" its $15 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel (5401.T, NPSCY). Trump said tax incentives and tariffs will enable the American steel giant to thrive on its own.

In a research note released to reporters on Monday, BofA's economics team led by Claudio Irigoyen projected the US economy will grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than current forecasts for 2% growth, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. This comes despite uncertainties surrounding the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump, including campaign promises of tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration, which economists have viewed as inflationary. Higher rates, coupled with a hawkish tariff policy, would strengthen the US dollar and create spillover effects to global financial conditions, representing "a major shock, not only for the US economy but the rest of the world," according to BofA. But there's one important caveat: The US is best prepared to weather any economic storm that follows Trump's agenda.

Title: Ex-Dividend Reminder: NVIDIA, Qualcomm And NXP Semiconductors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dividendchannel/2024/12/03/ex-dividend-reminder-nvidia-qualcomm-and-nxp-semiconductors/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T15:21:55Z

On 12/5/24, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and NXP Semiconductors will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. NVIDIA will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.01 on 12/27/24, Qualcomm will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.85 on 12/19/24, and NXP Semiconductors will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.014 on 1/8/25. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of NVDA's recent stock price of $138.63, this dividend works out to approximately 0.01%, so look for shares of NVIDIA to trade 0.01% lower — all else being equal — when NVDA shares open for trading on 12/5/24. Similarly, investors should look for QCOM to open 0.52% lower in price and for NXPI to open 0.43% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for NVDA, QCOM, and NXPI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. NVIDIA: NVDA Qualcomm: QCOM NXP Semiconductors: NXPI In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.03% for NVIDIA, 2.09% for Qualcomm, and 1.74% for NXP Semiconductors. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Tuesday trading, NVIDIA shares are currently up about 0.3%, Qualcomm shares are up about 2.8%, and NXP Semiconductors shares are up about 1.9% on the day.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other oil stocks with biggest upside potential. In an interview with CNBC on November 26, Daan Struyven, Co-Head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, discussed the current state of the oil market and the potential impact of a ceasefire in the Middle East on oil prices. Struyven noted that while the geopolitical risk premium in oil prices was fairly modest, he thinks that the market is focused on risks with a clear path to lower production. The market has not yet fully priced into this possibility, and the current price of oil is too low compared to inventory fundamentals. Struyven pointed out that global oil inventories have edged down this year, and the market has been in a deficit of around 0.5% of global markets. He thinks that many oil investors are pricing in a large surplus for 2025, which Struyven believes is not done yet and he sees significant upside risk to prices in the short term, potentially coming from lower production from Iran.

Struyven noted that while the Trump administration's goals are achievable, they are largely driven by technological advancements and LNG export plans that are already underway despite any policy change. He also agreed that the big oil companies are not eager to spend more money on production on current oil prices. Struyven also highlighted OPEC's influence on the market, emphasizing Saudi Arabia's preference for higher oil prices. He suggested that OPEC would likely defend a price floor of around $70 per barrel but would not hesitate to increase supply if prices climb above $80. This aligns with his expectation that oil prices will remain within a range of $70 to $85 per barrel. Finally, Struyven attributed the changes in the oil market to the success of US shale production, which has accounted for 100% of global oil production growth over the past decade. This has put downward pressure on long-term prices, making it less likely for oil prices to spike above $100 as they did in the past. The oil market is influenced by a range of factors, including geopolitical risks, production levels, and OPEC's strategies. The potential for a ceasefire in the Middle East, for example, could impact prices, but the geopolitical risk premium is still relatively modest. Despite this, oil prices remain lower than expected based on inventory fundamentals. While these dynamics shape the near-term outlook, long-term oil price increases above $100 are less likely due to the impact of US shale production, which has accounted for all global oil production growth over the past decade. For this article, we sifted through Energy ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 35 Oil stocks. We then sourced the analysts’ average price targets and picked the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of November 29. We also included their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 22.20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66 ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a leading independent exploration and production company with extensive crude oil operations worldwide. The company specializes in unconventional oil production from U.S. shale formations and traditional reservoirs in global markets. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) supplies crude oil to refineries, industrial customers, and international markets. On November 22, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) finalized its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), enhancing its potential for long-term growth. The company anticipates achieving synergies exceeding $1 billion on a run-rate basis within the next 12 months. On October 31, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) announced its Q3 financial results. During the quarter, the company generated $5.8 billion in cash from operating activities, including $4.7 billion in cash from operations. It also raised its regular dividend by 34% to $0.78 per share and expanded its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has presented a 10-year strategic plan emphasizing disciplined investment, steady growth, improved returns, and substantial cash distributions to shareholders. This approach positions ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) uniquely among its peers. Overall, COP ranks 9th on our list of oil stocks with biggest upside potential according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of COP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

US stocks drifted near all-time highs on Tuesday as investors waited for fresh jobs data and Fedspeak to cement or dent growing hopes for future interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hugged the flatline, coming off fresh records for the two gauges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up about 0.1%. Investors are bracing for a reading later on JOLTS job openings in October, the first in a wave of key data this week that culminates in Friday's all-important monthly US payrolls report. The watch is on for signs of a soft landing for the economy, which will shape views on the path of rates — especially after Federal Reserve officials hinted that they're still open to a December cut. Traders are now pricing in about a 73% chance that the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point at its Dec. 18 meeting, compared with 62% a day ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Those odds could shift after appearances by Fed policymakers Austan Goolsbee and Adriana Kugler later Tuesday, which set the stage for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's panel discussion on Wednesday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped in early trading after shipments of the EV maker's China-built models fell again, putting sales targets in doubt. In addition, CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay deal was rejected again by a judge. Meanwhile, shares in US Steel (X) fell about 8% on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump's promise to "block" its $15 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel (5401.T, NPSCY). Trump said tax incentives and tariffs will enable the American steel giant to thrive on its own. Political turmoil in France is also attracting market attention, with the government on the brink of collapse as its faces a parliamentary vote. With Germany also set for a snap election after a government breakdown, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on the two pillars of the EU.

Title: Wall Street Analysts React to HP (HPQ) Earnings – Bulls Vs Bears

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

A laptop, showing off the companys sleek notebook computers and workstations. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42 HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) recently posted quarterly results and the stock fell amid downbeat Q1 guidance. Citi maintained its Neutral rating on HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) but reduced the price target to $36.50 from $37. Analysts, led by Asiya Merchant, noted HP’s stock fell due to weaker-than-expected guidance, driven by subdued PC recovery and inflated commodity costs impacting margins in the short term. While they expect the PC recovery to gain momentum in upcoming quarters with margin improvement, the Print segment exceeded expectations. However, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) anticipates a low single-digit decline in the overall market through fiscal 2025. Margins are expected to remain at the top of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)’s target range, thanks to a shift towards more profitable units and cost actions. The analysts noted that EPS for the year will likely fall a penny below consensus expectations at $3.60 (midpoint), but still below Citi’s forecast. On the other hand, Evercore kept an Outperform rating and a $40 price target. Amit Daryanani and his team highlighted HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)’s solid results despite weak PC market conditions. While there are concerns about below-seasonal EPS guidance for Q1, the analysts believe the second-half guidance is reasonable given industry dynamics. TD Cowen maintained its Hold rating but raised the price target to $39 from $32, citing soft end markets that hinder the company’s progress with cost restructuring. The analysts noted that HP’s Q4 EPS met Street estimates, but the outlook missed expectations due to continued softness in the PC market and higher variable compensation costs for fiscal Q1 2025. Importantly, the analysts said HP’s fiscal 2025 EPS outlook is in line, as PC growth in the second half of the year and strong Print profitability should drive mid-single-digit EPS growth. While premium PC mix and the repricing of PC parts support Free Cash Flow, weak consumer PC demand and challenges in Print may limit HP’s ability to achieve significant EPS growth. J.P. Morgan maintained its Overweight rating but lowered the price target to $40 from $41. Overall, HPQ ranks 10th on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of HPQ, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HPQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Cyber Monday may be over, but the deals are still going strong—for now. Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Every item on this list has been vetted, tested, and loved by someone at WIRED. Our Gear team has cross-checked these picks with our buying guides to ensure you're getting the lowest prices—or close to it. Don't wait too long, though. These prices won't stick around forever—some may already expire by the time you reach the end of this story. Jump to Category Our Process We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. To find you the best deals, we use a proprietary tool that scans prices on everything we've reviewed over the last two years and spotlights notable price changes. We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess.

You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds.

It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor.

It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

SAN JOSE, Calif. & MIDLAND, Texas - Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) and AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) have announced a collaboration focused on enhancing global connectivity through space-based cellular broadband, leveraging Cadence's design tools and AST SpaceMobile's satellite technology. The partnership has led to the development of the AST5000 ASIC, a custom chip designed to improve processing bandwidth by up to ten times per satellite. This advancement is a key component of AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird program, which aims to provide seamless, high-speed internet access from space to standard smartphones on Earth. While InvestingPro data shows the company's overall financial health score as 'Weak', it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, suggesting financial flexibility for this innovative venture. Get access to 10+ additional ProTips and comprehensive analysis with InvestingPro's detailed research reports. Cadence's high-speed SerDes and other fundamental IP, along with their design enablement team, have allowed for significant power, performance, and area (PPA) optimizations in the system-on-chip (SoC), thereby enhancing the efficiency of the AST5000 ASIC. A critical phase of the collaboration was the utilization of Cadence’s Palladium® Emulation Platform, which facilitated pre-silicon development by validating and refining IP integration. This process ensured the integrity and performance of the final chip design. Huiwen Yao, chief technology officer at AST SpaceMobile, emphasized the importance of Cadence's industry-leading design solutions in overcoming the engineering challenges associated with building a reliable space-based cellular network. Boyd Phelps, senior vice president and general manager of the Silicon Solutions Group at Cadence, expressed excitement about contributing to a project that pushes the boundaries of satellite and mobile capabilities. AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird satellite is expected to support up to 10,000 MHz of processing bandwidth per satellite in the future, with potential data transmission speeds of up to 120 Mbps. This will enable voice calls, full data, and video applications on a cellular broadband network accessible to everyday smartphones. This collaboration aligns with Cadence's mission of enabling more efficient design cycles and hastening the journey towards a connected future. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, AST SpaceMobile, Inc. has been making significant strides in its mission to establish a global cellular broadband network in space. The company has successfully launched five Block 1 BlueBird satellites, the largest commercial phased array satellites in low Earth orbit, and is preparing to launch 25 more Block 2 satellites. The company has also secured launch agreements with Blue Origin and SpaceX for the years 2025 and 2026. AST SpaceMobile's CEO, Abel Avellan, has recently entered into a variable prepaid forward contract, a strategic move approved by the company's Board of Directors. This non-dilutive transaction accounts for approximately 3.2% of Mr. Avellan's total holdings and less than 1% of the company's total Class A common stock. The company has also reported a substantial increase in cash reserves to $518.9 million. In addition to these financial developments, AST SpaceMobile is negotiating commercial agreements with major partners like AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and the company plans to expand its ground infrastructure in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Despite an increase in estimated direct material and launch costs per satellite, the company remains confident in its growth trajectory.

Title: Stellantis' CEO stepping down shows how the auto industry is struggling to shift into high gear right now
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/auto-industry-major-challenges-stellantis-ceo-resigns-ev-tariffs-competition-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-03T14:09:22Z
Full Content:
Good morning! We've officially entered the season of company holiday parties. An etiquette expert shared some helpful tips to follow. (Take it easy on the booze.) In today's big story, an automaker CEO's resignation shows how tough a year the industry is having. What's on deck: But first, I'm just trying to get out of first gear. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. As dealerships look to clear their lots to make room for next year's models, automakers are also doing some housecleaning. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares resigned this weekend as the Jeep and Chrysler owner battles sliding sales. His expedited departure — Tavares was scheduled to leave in 2026 — shows how choppy the automotive industry remains. Stellantis' struggles have been particularly bad. Tavares's cost-cutting approach initially helped, but more recently the company's US sales were down 17% this year compared to last year, writes Business Insider's Nora Naughton. The new boss will have plenty of issues to sort through, including a legal battle with the United Auto Workers union, writes BI's Tom Carter. So, what's got the auto industry stuck in gear? There are three big issues at play here: The EV problem: Arguably the biggest issue facing automakers is slowing demand for electric vehicles. While EV sales are still rising, they aren't pacing how they were a few years ago. That's forced automakers to recalibrate strategies that were anticipating the EV good times would keep rolling. Hybrid cars are also making a comeback, further complicating plans. The China problem: As if the EV market wasn't hard enough, there's the added challenge of Chinese competitors gaining market share. Their budget-friendly EVs are proving to be a huge hit in the world's largest auto market (China), much to the annoyance of Tesla. They also turned heads at Europe's largest auto show this year. Even Ford CEO Jim Farley acknowledged how much he enjoyed a Chinese EV. (It hasn't been a complete lovefest; he also called China's auto industry an "existential threat.") The tariff problem: President-elect Donald Trump's surprise announcement to enact a 25% tax on goods imported from Mexico is the newest hurdle for automakers. The US imported more than $65 billion worth of car parts from Mexico last year. Tesla also previously announced plans for a new $10 billion factory in Mexico. Trump's trade plans might not ultimately be implemented, but the uncertainty means car manufacturers could reconsider their supply chains.

Title: Collect 12% Yields By Investing Like A Billionaire In 2025

If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns Ycharts However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns Ycharts In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms Ycharts That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.

If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there.

BlackRock is buying credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners in a stock deal valued at about $12 billion, giving it more ways to service its insurance clients BlackRock is buying credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners in a stock deal valued at about $12 billion, giving it more ways to service its insurance clients. BlackRock said Tuesday that the transaction includes equity issued by a subsidiary, and that the equity can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock. The company said the transaction creates an integrated private credit franchise with approximately $220 billion in client assets. HPS has approximately $148 billion in client assets and is an independent provider of private credit for insurance clients. BlackRock said that the acquisition of HPS will position it to be a full-service, fiduciary provider of public-private asset management and technology solutions for insurance clients. BlackRock and HPS will create a new private financing solutions division. “Today marks an important milestone in our drive to become the world’s leading provider of private financing solutions,” HPS CEO Scott Kapnick said in a statement. “Our partnership with BlackRock will further strengthen our position in this fast growing but increasingly competitive market.” HPS is one of several acquisitions BlackRock has made this year. In January the New York company announced that it was buying independent infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners in a cash-and-stock deal valued at more than $12 billion. That transaction was completed in October. BlackRock then announced in June that it was buying private markets data provider Preqin in an approximately $3.2 billion deal. The acquisition is targeted to close before the end of the year. The transaction with HPS is expected to close mid-2025. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures drifted near all-time highs on Tuesday as investors waited for fresh jobs data and Fedspeak to cement or dent growing hopes for interest-rate cuts. Futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were down around 0.1%, coming off fresh records for the indexes. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) traded broadly flat. Investors are bracing for a reading later on JOLTS job openings in October, the first in a wave of key data this week that culminates in Friday's all-important monthly US payrolls report. The watch is on for signs of a soft landing for the economy, which will shape views on the path of rates — especially after Federal Reserve officials hinted that they're still open to a December cut. Traders are now pricing in about a 73% chance that the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point at its Dec. 18 meeting, compared with 62% a day ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Those odds could shift after appearances by Fed policymakers Austan Goolsbee and Adriana Kugler later Tuesday, which set the stage for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's panel discussion on Wednesday. On the corporate front, Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped in pre-market trading after shipments of the EV maker's China-built models fell again, putting sales targets in doubt. In addition, CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay deal was rejected again by a judge. Meanwhile, shares in US Steel (X) fell over 8% on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump's promise to "block" its $15 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel (5401.T, NPSCY). Trump said tax incentives and tariffs will enable the American steel giant to thrive on its own. Political turmoil in France is also attracting market attention, with the government on the brink of collapse as its faces a parliamentary vote. With Germany also set for a snap election after a government breakdown, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on the two pillars of the EU. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Lots of analysis on the CEO shake-up at Intel (INTC) has been released, but indeed this is NOT a one day story. The path forward for Intel is vitally important for the country — the chip supply chain must be diversified beyond the singular reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). But that path forward for Intel will be brutal, at best. Here are a couple good points this morning out of EvercoreISI analyst Mark Lipacis: "We see multiple challenges for INTC, regardless of the CEO: 1) the computing center of gravity is drifting away from x86 in the datacenter to GPUs, and at the edge to ARM, 2) INTC is not only competing with AMD (AMD), but also Nvidia (NVDA) and its own customers making custom CPU and AI processors, 3) INTC has continued to lose share in servers and desktops, although it has stabilized share in notebooks. Some of my initial insight on Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's departure down below. Billionaire Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight behind a computing company that’s coming for Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance of the artificial intelligence chip market. Since leaving his post as Microsoft CEO in 2000, Bill Gates has become one of the world's most visible philanthropists. He does most of his charitable giving through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which manages an estimated $45 billion ... Art Cashin, a renowned market pundit and the UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange, has died at the age of 83, UBS said. Cashin, once dubbed "Wall Street's version of Walter Cronkite" by The Washington Post, was a regular on CNBC, delivering stock market commentary and analysis to the business news channel's viewers for more than 25 years. "It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of the passing of Arthur Cashin, Jr., a true giant in our industry," Bill Carroll, head of sales and development at UBS Wealth Management USA, said in a memo sent to employees on Monday. Meta stock could be one of the best buys in the artificial intelligence industry right now. Now, let's consider one of the highest-profile companies today, and that's artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In fact, Nvidia just completed its most recent stock split in June after the shares soared past $900 earlier in the year -- and then surged past $1,000 after Nvidia's announcement of the split. Is it possible that Nvidia, so soon after that operation, could decide to launch another stock split? The past couple of years have been terrific for stocks, with the benchmark S&P 500 index up a whopping 57.1% since the end of 2022. The average stock in the S&P 500 index offers a yield of just 1.2%, but Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC), and Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI) offer more than 6% at recent prices. Here's why adding them to a diversified portfolio now makes a lot of sense for most income-seeking investors. Here's how much Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is worth as he steps down from the helm of the chipmaker, whose shares have lost around 61% of their value during his tenure. Supermicro shares jumped nearly 30% Monday after the server maker announced that an independent review of its accounting practices found no wrongdoing. Monitor these key chart levels.

Good morning. I’m thrilled to announce that Jeffrey Katzenberg will join us at Fortune Brainstorm AI next week in San Francisco. The media mogul and three-time Brainstorm veteran—his last was in 2019—will speak alongside his WndrCo founding partner Sujay Jaswa and Writer CEO May Habib about how AI is transforming storytelling. The trio is the final piece of a brilliant two-day program. Want to see it IRL? We’re at capacity, but please bookmark our livestream page, where you can watch mainstage sessions for free. I hear this AI stuff is gonna be big, folks. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. Pat Gelsinger is suddenly out as Intel CEO. His retirement was announced yesterday, with immediate effect. Gelsinger was the consummate Intel vet, joining the company in 1979 and working his way up to CTO in 2001. He left the fold in 2009 to serve at EMC (president and COO) and then VMware (CEO), then returned to Intel as CEO in 2021. Gelsinger’s task was existential for the company—with its glory days long behind it, he had to turn it around. His plan for that revolved around separating Intel’s legacy chip-design business from its manufacturing side, in the hope that other chip firms would pay to use the latter. But Intel has so far failed to make a sustainable business out of its foundry arm. It has also fallen way behind in the AI chip race. The company recently announced job cuts and the freezing of key factory build-outs as it tries to repair its financials, and it seems Gelsinger has fallen victim to that scramble for survival. He was reportedly forced out by a board frustrated with his pace of progress. Intel’s new interim co-CEOs are David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, and the search is on for a permanent replacement…or maybe a buyer. —David Meyer Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has joined a $700 million funding round for Tenstorrent, a Toronto-born, Silicon Valley-based AI chip startup that wants to take on Nvidia. The round included investments from South Korea’s AFW Partners, Samsung Securities, LG Electronics, Fidelity, and Hyundai Motor, as well as Canada’s export credit agency and a major pension fund in Ontario, according to Bloomberg. The money will reportedly be used to hire engineers, purchase computing equipment, and expand its global supply chain. TSMC and Samsung are expected to manufacture the company’s next-generation chips. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, but its products are relatively expensive and extremely proprietary. Like other Nvidia rivals, Tenstorrent hopes to cater to customers who seek better interoperability and more value by using open-source software and hardware components that are less specialized. The company has reportedly signed $150 million worth of customers deals so far. OpenAI is reportedly discussing plans to add advertising to its artificial intelligence products. CFO Sarah Friar told the Financial Times that the firm, which is in the midst of restructuring as a for-profit company, was weighing a business model that would include ads. OpenAI would be “thoughtful about when and where we implement them,” she told the paper. (Friar subsequently said that OpenAI has “no active plans to pursue advertising” and was simply exploring other revenue streams. The FT notes that OpenAI has recently hired advertising talent from rivals Meta and Google.) The ChatGPT-maker currently generates most of its revenue by selling access to its AI models through subscriptions and other types of usage fees. The company’s monthly revenue reportedly reached $300 million in August, and it expects about $3.7 billion in annual sales this year; on the flip side, it will lose billions after accounting for computing equipment, employee salaries, and other costs. The new CEO of Amazon’s cloud computing business previewed the division’s annual Re:Invent confab—which takes place this week in Las Vegas—by saying that the AI arms race is one without end. “It is such a foundational technology,” said Matt Garman, who was named chief of Amazon Web Services in June, to the Wall Street Journal. “It’s just a thing that’s going to happen forever.” Re:Invent runs through Friday, but AWS plans to roll out major product news today. Earlier this year, Amazon announced a fresh $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic and $100 billion in data center investment over the next decade. There have also been rumors of a new version of its in-house “Trainium” AI chip, first launched in 2020. With about 39% of the market, Amazon is the world’s largest cloud computing provider and is perpetually at risk of losing its sizable lead to Microsoft (23%), Google (8%), and a number of smaller players including Alibaba, Oracle, IBM, and Salesforce. World Labs—founded in 2023 by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li and technologists Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall—has revealed an AI system that can generate three-dimensional worlds from a single image. That’s right: Input a 2D image, output a video-game like 3D environment. The company says it’s a “first step towards spatial intelligence.” Like early text-to-image examples of generative AI, the results are a bit blurry and more than a little fantastical. (Generating environments from Edward Hopper’s iconic Nighthawks from 1942 or Wassily Kandinsky’s 1908 work Murnau - Landscape with Green House only underscores the point.) They’re also limited in how far you’re able to explore. But it’s certainly an exciting development, and not at all difficult to see how the technology could be deployed at a video game studio. World Labs says the generated worlds “obey basic physical rules of 3D geometry” and don’t change once created—important if you’re in the business of designing levels for games. World Labs announced in September that it had raised $230 million from an array of high-profile investors including venture firms Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Radical Ventures, the venture arms of Adobe, AMD, Databricks, Intel, and Nvidia, as well as tech luminaries Marc Benioff, Eric Schmidt, and Ashton Kutcher. —SuperMicro external review finds no wrongdoing.

"We have always sought to position ourselves ahead of our clients' needs. Together with the scale, capabilities, and expertise of the HPS team, BlackRock will deliver clients solutions that seamlessly blend public and private," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. The deal, which is expected to close in mid-2025, comes during a boom for the private credit space. Comparable publicly traded companies to HPS such as Blue Owl Capital and Ares are up 54.6% and 46%, respectively, for 2024. Those gains are well ahead of BlackRock's 25.7% year-to-date gain. The transaction also creates "an integrated private credit franchise" with about $220 billion in assets, per BlackRock. HPS manages about $148 billion in assets. BlackRock oversees $11.5 trillion as of the third quarter. Sources told CNBC that HPS first sought to go public, which caught BlackRock's attention as it looks to grow its alternative assets business. BlackRock earlier this year announced it would acquire Global Infrastructure Partners and private market data provider Preqin for $12.5 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The deal is also expected to raise BlackRock's private market AUM and management fees by 40% and roughly 35%, respectively.

Company unveils strategy to expand America's largest fiber broadband network1 to 50 million+ total locations2.Company provides long-term guidance for sustained growth in consolidated service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS, underpinned by continued capital investment.Company expects improved financial performance to support $40 billion+ of anticipated shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases over the next three years, including an initial share repurchase authorization of $10 billion that management expects to complete by the end of 2026.Company to webcast Analyst & Investor Day presentation at 2 p.m. ET today on the AT&T Investor Relations website. DALLAS, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day presentation, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: NYSE:T) unveiled a bold, multi-year strategic plan highlighted by continued profitable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. This growth is expected to fuel enhanced shareholder returns on network investments through a robust and balanced capital allocation program. "Over the last four years, we've achieved durable and profitable subscriber growth, generated attractive returns on network investment, and strengthened our balance sheet," said John Stankey, AT&T CEO. "We're putting customers first to become the best connectivity provider in America. Our plan expands the country's largest fiber network to more than 50 million total locations, modernizes our wireless network and rewards our shareholders. As we grow, we expect to return more than $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. With this bold strategy, we are entering a new era of sustained growth at AT&T." Momentum to Continue with Investment-Led Strategy and Customer-Centric ApproachAT&T is making progress on its journey to become the best connectivity provider in America. Over the past four-plus years, the Company has streamlined its operations and centered its business around the customer as it enhanced and simplified their experiences with AT&T. The Company has also greatly expanded its 5G and fiber services to more people and places and is the largest capital investor in U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. With the plans announced today, the Company will unlock new capabilities that further its momentum while investing in future growth “ ultimately enabling more robust shareholder returns. As a result of continued investment, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. In Mobility, the Company is building a more efficient, high-capacity, programmable and open network. By 2027, it expects to have largely completed the modernization of its 5G wireless network with open technology, with deep mid-band 5G spectrum covering 300 million+ people by the end of 2026. This network will support super-fast download speeds and serve as a platform for new product and GenAI innovation. In broadband, the Company is creating even more distance between itself and the competition on what is already the largest fiber broadband network in America. By the end of 2029, it expects to reach 50 million+ total locations with fiber. This includes expectations to pass about 45 million locations through its organic fiber deployment and serve 5 million+ fiber locations through Gigapower, its joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), as well as through agreements with commercial open-access providers. The Company's fiber expansion will greatly increase its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner. While building the network of the future, the Company is actively working to exit its legacy copper network operations across the large majority of its wireline footprint by the end of 2029. The Company believes sustaining industry-leading levels of network investment and pursuing these strategic objectives will ultimately allow it to offer the best value, greater personalization and security and more customer-centric products and services on the largest, highest-capacity, lowest-marginal cost network in America. Long-Term OutlookAT&T expects to achieve the following 2025 and long-term financial targets through 2027. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, and as a result of the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity method investment, the Company plans to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding earnings and cash flows related to DIRECTV. The Company continues to expect the sale of its entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG to close in mid-2025. For comparability to these targets, the Company has provided a recast of historical results for these two financial measures in its Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024.Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2025-2027.Mobility service revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range annually.Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens annually.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2025-2027.Mobility EBITDA growth in the 3% to 4% range annually.Consumer Wireline EBITDA grows at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027.Business Wireline EBITDA declines at a low-double-digit CAGR through 2027; Business Solutions EBITDA approaching stabilization by the end of 2027.Capital investment in the $22 billion range annually from 2025-2027.Free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, of $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2027.In addition, AT&T expects to receive $5.4 billion of after-tax cash payments in 2025 and $0.5 billion in 2029 related to the sale of the DIRECTV investment.Adjusted EPS, excluding DIRECTV, of $1.97 to $2.07 in 2025, accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027.$3 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2027, inclusive of the Company's target of achieving $2 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by mid-2026.Long-Term Capital Allocation Plan: $50 Billion+ of Financial Capacity Supports $40 Billion+ of Dividends and Share RepurchasesAT&T expects this plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target. The Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025, and maintain leverage within this range through 2027. The Company expects to return $40 billion+ of this financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027. Under this plan, the Company also expects approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Of the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board has authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization. 2024 OutlookFor the full-year, AT&T expects:Wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range.Broadband revenue growth of 7%+.Adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range.Capital investment at the high-end of the $21 to $22 billion range.Free cash flow in the $17 to $18 billion range, tracking toward the midpoint of this range; excluding approximately $2.5 billion of after-tax cash payments from DIRECTV, free cash flow in the $15 billion range.Adjusted EPS of $2.20 to $2.25, reflecting an increase from the previously provided $2.15 to $2.25 range. This includes an expected adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV of approximately $0.30 per share post-tax. When excluding this, the Company expects adjusted EPS in the $1.90 to $1.95 range.Tune Into AT&T's Analyst & Investor Day PresentationThe Company will provide more details around its strategy and plans to drive strong returns to shareholders today at 2 p.m. ET.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsInformation set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available below and on the Company's website at investors.att.com. Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

DALLAS, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day presentation, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: NYSE:T) unveiled a bold, multi-year strategic plan highlighted by continued profitable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. This growth is expected to fuel enhanced shareholder returns on network investments through a robust and balanced capital allocation program. "Over the last four years, we've achieved durable and profitable subscriber growth, generated attractive returns on network investment, and strengthened our balance sheet," said John Stankey, AT&T CEO. "We're putting customers first to become the best connectivity provider in America. Our plan expands the country's largest fiber network to more than 50 million total locations, modernizes our wireless network and rewards our shareholders. As we grow, we expect to return more than $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. With this bold strategy, we are entering a new era of sustained growth at AT&T." Momentum to Continue with Investment-Led Strategy and Customer-Centric ApproachAT&T is making progress on its journey to become the best connectivity provider in America. Over the past four-plus years, the Company has streamlined its operations and centered its business around the customer as it enhanced and simplified their experiences with AT&T. The Company has also greatly expanded its 5G and fiber services to more people and places and is the largest capital investor in U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. With the plans announced today, the Company will unlock new capabilities that further its momentum while investing in future growth “ ultimately enabling more robust shareholder returns. As a result of continued investment, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. In Mobility, the Company is building a more efficient, high-capacity, programmable and open network. By 2027, it expects to have largely completed the modernization of its 5G wireless network with open technology, with deep mid-band 5G spectrum covering 300 million+ people by the end of 2026. This network will support super-fast download speeds and serve as a platform for new product and GenAI innovation. In broadband, the Company is creating even more distance between itself and the competition on what is already the largest fiber broadband network in America. By the end of 2029, it expects to reach 50 million+ total locations with fiber. This includes expectations to pass about 45 million locations through its organic fiber deployment and serve 5 million+ fiber locations through Gigapower, its joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), as well as through agreements with commercial open-access providers. The Company's fiber expansion will greatly increase its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner. While building the network of the future, the Company is actively working to exit its legacy copper network operations across the large majority of its wireline footprint by the end of 2029. The Company believes sustaining industry-leading levels of network investment and pursuing these strategic objectives will ultimately allow it to offer the best value, greater personalization and security and more customer-centric products and services on the largest, highest-capacity, lowest-marginal cost network in America. Long-Term OutlookAT&T expects to achieve the following 2025 and long-term financial targets through 2027. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, and as a result of the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity method investment, the Company plans to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding earnings and cash flows related to DIRECTV. The Company continues to expect the sale of its entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG to close in mid-2025. For comparability to these targets, the Company has provided a recast of historical results for these two financial measures in its Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024.Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2025-2027.Mobility service revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range annually.Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens annually.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2025-2027.Mobility EBITDA growth in the 3% to 4% range annually.Consumer Wireline EBITDA grows at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027.Business Wireline EBITDA declines at a low-double-digit CAGR through 2027; Business Solutions EBITDA approaching stabilization by the end of 2027.Capital investment in the $22 billion range annually from 2025-2027.Free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, of $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2027.In addition, AT&T expects to receive $5.4 billion of after-tax cash payments in 2025 and $0.5 billion in 2029 related to the sale of the DIRECTV investment.Adjusted EPS, excluding DIRECTV, of $1.97 to $2.07 in 2025, accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027.$3 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2027, inclusive of the Company's target of achieving $2 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by mid-2026.Long-Term Capital Allocation Plan: $50 Billion+ of Financial Capacity Supports $40 Billion+ of Dividends and Share RepurchasesAT&T expects this plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target. The Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025, and maintain leverage within this range through 2027. The Company expects to return $40 billion+ of this financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027. Under this plan, the Company also expects approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Of the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board has authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization. 2024 OutlookFor the full-year, AT&T expects:Wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range.Broadband revenue growth of 7%+.Adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range.Capital investment at the high-end of the $21 to $22 billion range.Free cash flow in the $17 to $18 billion range, tracking toward the midpoint of this range; excluding approximately $2.5 billion of after-tax cash payments from DIRECTV, free cash flow in the $15 billion range.Adjusted EPS of $2.20 to $2.25, reflecting an increase from the previously provided $2.15 to $2.25 range. This includes an expected adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV of approximately $0.30 per share post-tax. When excluding this, the Company expects adjusted EPS in the $1.90 to $1.95 range.Tune Into AT&T's Analyst & Investor Day PresentationThe Company will provide more details around its strategy and plans to drive strong returns to shareholders today at 2 p.m. ET.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsInformation set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available below and on the Company's website at investors.att.com. Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Title: BlackRock strikes $12 billion deal for private credit firm HPS Investment

By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) -BlackRock will buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion in an all-stock deal, the companies said on Tuesday, as the world's largest asset manager seeks to expand in a red-hot market. Private credit, or lending to companies by institutions other than banks, has grown rapidly in recent years as stricter regulations made it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. The asset class is expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Preqin data. "Together we will deliver income solutions for our clients that blend both the best of the public markets and the best of the private markets in an organized, unified fashion," BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday. He has previously outlined private credit to be a "primary growth driver" within alternatives for BlackRock in coming years. HPS was founded in 2007 as a division of Highbridge Capital Management, the hedge fund unit of JPMorgan's asset management arm. In 2016, top HPS executives acquired the firm from JPMorgan. Since then, the New York-based company has become a massive private credit player, with assets under management vaulting to about $148 billion as of September from $34 billion in 2016. HPS originally aimed to do an initial public offering, but was approached by a number of parties including BlackRock, a source familiar with the matter said. HPS did not immediately return a request for comment. BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, has an existing $85 billion private credit platform as of Sept. 30. A new private financing solutions business unit will be formed, which will be led by the HPS leadership team. BlackRock will pay roughly 9.2 million shares upon deal close that are worth about $9.4 billion as of Monday's close. Nearly 2.9 million shares will be paid in about five years, subject to certain conditions. As part of the deal, which is expected to close in mid-2025, BlackRock will retire for cash or refinance about $400 million of existing HPS debt. "The HPS deal positions BlackRock to offer comprehensive alternative asset management portfolio services to the largest institutions in the world ... significantly advancing its private-market growth goals," said Ana Arsov, global head of private credit at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Ratings. BlackRock's stock was last up 1.7% on Tuesday. “This is a really good move for them to try and bolster their higher fee areas,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp, which holds BlackRock shares. PRIVATE MARKETS PUSH BlackRock has been on an acquisition spree this year, splurging roughly $28 billion as it positions itself as a comprehensive platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. In October, the New York-based firm finalized its $12.5 billion acquisition of infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners and anticipates completing the $3.2 billion purchase of private markets data provider Preqin by year-end. "GIP gave them infrastructure, but they still didn't really have a meaningful presence in private credit ... I think they've plugged the gap," said Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. The source familiar with the situation said a private equity firm could be BlackRock's next major acquisition. BlackRock declined comment. Edward Jones' Sanders said private equity is an area where BlackRock remains smaller than some of the largest firms, although it is a more mature product with likely less growth potential than infrastructure and private credit. This year's deals aim to strengthen BlackRock's foothold in infrastructure investments and private markets, both pivotal growth areas. Fink on Tuesday said he expected a "dramatic expansion" of private capital in backing infrastructure investments. BlackRock manages roughly $450 billion in alternative assets post-GIP acquisition. HIGHER FEES The HPS deal, which will create a private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets, will also increase BlackRock's private markets fee-paying assets under management and management fees by 40% and about 35%, respectively. Recent acquisitions will bolster BlackRock fees when compared to "razor thin margins" coming from passive investment, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. Private assets carry much higher fees than exchange-traded funds, which is BlackRock's main business. Still, BlackRock's rival alternative asset managers Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) have made bigger strides in private credit. Apollo manages $598 billion in credit assets and Ares $335 billion as of Sept. 30. Blackstone manages $432 billion in assets across its entire credit platform. The HPS deal comes amid speculation BlackRock's long-time boss Fink may eventually step down from leading the firm. Speaking at a New York event in October, Fink said the growth of private markets could mitigate the economic impact of wide U.S. deficits and high government debt levels. He also said at the time he was not thinking about retiring. In an op-ed he wrote for the Wall Street Journal in November, Fink said private investments in infrastructure projects such as data centers could help boost U.S. economic growth.

MIAMI, Dec. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs today launched NVOX, the world's first single-stock leveraged ETF for the pharmaceutical stock Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NYSE:NVO). As the weight loss market continues to expand and Novo Nordisk is a key provider in that space, NVOX offers retail investors 2X daily long leveraged exposure to the change in the daily share price of Novo Nordisk without the need for a margin account. This provides a unique tool for tactical traders. NVOX does not invest directly in Novo Nordisk and has a higher degree of risk due to tracking a single stock. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark, seeking to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon their heritage in diabetes. The company does so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to their medicines, and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease. Novo Nordisk employs about 69,000 people in 80 countries and markets its products in around 170 countries. "For investors who want to gain enhanced exposure to the share price movement of Novo Nordisk stock, NVOX is a great choice, said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs. As people worldwide are losing weight using products like Ozempic and Wegovy, their maker Novo Nordisk represents a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, and we are excited to provide investors with a groundbreaking trading tool to participate in this transformative sector." About Defiance ETFs Founded in 2018, Defiance stands as a leading ETF issuer dedicated to income and thematic investing. Defiance also pioneers leveraged ETFs designed for traders seeking tactical opportunities. Our suite of first-mover leveraged & thematic ETFs empowers investors to express targeted views on disruptive innovations, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing, while our actively managed options ETFs are designed to seek current income. Important Disclosures The fund attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to two times (200%) the share price performance of an underlying exchange-traded fund (an Underlying Security). The Fund is not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund is very different from most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The Fund's investment adviser will not attempt to position a Fund's portfolio to ensure that the Fund does not gain or lose more than a maximum percentage of its net asset value on a given trading day. As a consequence, if an Underlying Security's share price referenced by a Fund decreases by more than 50% on a given trading day, the corresponding Fund's investors could lose all of their money. NVOX Disclosure: Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund's investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (Tidal or the Adviser). The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and / or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund's investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment. Total (EPA:TTEF) return represents changes to the NAV and accounts for distributions from the fund. Median 30 Day Spread is a calculation of Fund's median bid-ask spread, expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth, computed by: identifying the Fund's national best bid and national best offer as of the end of each 10 second interval during each trading day of the last 30 calendar days; dividing the difference between each such bid and offer by the midpoint of the national best bid and national best offer; and identifying the median of those values. Underlying Security Risk. The underlying security is subject to many risks that can negatively impact the Fund. Indirect Investment in NVO Nordisk Risk. NVO Nordisk is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way and has no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. NVO Trading Risk. The trading price of the Underlying Security may exhibit volatility and significant fluctuations due to various factors inherent in the semiconductor industry. This sector is susceptible to price and volume fluctuations, which may not always correlate with the companies' operational performance. Short sellers may exert influence on trading dynamics, potentially impacting supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. NVO Performance Risk. NVO may fail to meet its publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of NVO to decline. NVO provides guidance regarding its expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Pharmaceutical (TADAWUL:2070) Industry Risks. Pharmaceutical research and development are very costly and highly uncertain; NVO may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. NVO and NVO's products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost generic and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on NVO's business. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund's portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risks. Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Investing in emerging markets involves different and greater risks, as these countries are substantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in more developed markets. Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund's performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Fund performance, before fees and expenses. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Swap Agreements. The use of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. These risks may prevent the Fund from achieving its leveraged investment objective, even if the Underlying Security later reverses all or a portion of its movement. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in derivatives which exposes the Fund to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is non-diversified, it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. As a result, a decline in the value of an investment in a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers could cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund held a more diversified portfolio. New Fund Risk. As of the date of this prospectus, the Fund has no operating history and currently has fewer assets than larger funds. Like other new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's market exposure for limited periods of time. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades. NVOX is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.

NVO Nordisk is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way and has no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares.

Short sellers may exert influence on trading dynamics, potentially impacting supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. NVO Performance Risk. NVO may fail to meet its publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of NVO to decline. NVO provides guidance regarding its expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows.

Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund's portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risks. Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation.

Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Swap Agreements. The use of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions.

The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in derivatives which exposes the Fund to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund. Non-Diversification Risk.

Title: Pat Gelsinger and Carlos Tavares had the same big problem: Morning Brief

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The corporate world kicked off December with two big CEO departures. And both departures share an important commonality that almost no corporate executive can overcome, particularly in a bull market: Their company's stock price was in the basement. Stellantis (STLA) CEO Carlos Tavares quit on Sunday following a clash with the company's board. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger retired on Sunday in a move that was not entirely up to him. So far this year, Stellantis stock has lost 47%; Intel stock is down over 50%. And this in a year where the S&P 500 is up over 25%. No matter the track record of the CEO or the soundness of a turnaround plan, it is hard to underperform the S&P 500 by 60-plus percentage points in a single year and retain the benefit of the doubt from your board of directors. To wit, 2024 is pacing to have a record number of CEOs out of a job. Both executives were longtime industry leaders who had built their reputations over decades, navigating the ebbs and flows of the auto and semiconductor industries, respectively. Both men were tasked with trying to stabilize and turn around legacy brands facing existential challenges. And now, both are out of a job. Reporting from Reuters on Monday suggested Tavares's split with his board of directors came over a turnaround plan the board felt was too focused on cost cuts. Gelsinger's schism with his board emerged, among other things, over the scale of investments that may never pan out for Intel, a source told Yahoo Finance. But as Michael Farr, chief market strategist for Hightower Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban on Monday, "If a company’s figurative boat is sinking while most others are enjoying a rising tide, corrective action must be taken by the CEO and or the Board." Over the last decade, however, the idea of shareholder primacy has come under some scrutiny as the ESG movement put particular pressure on the idea that corporations should serve shareholder interests over everything else, with the stock price as the scoreboard for the company. And, of course, for the CEO. In 2019, for instance, the Business Roundtable announced nearly 200 CEOs had signed a new statement of purpose saying companies will be led "for the benefit of all stakeholders — customers, employees, supplier, communities and shareholders." Earlier this year, the Business Roundtable reiterated its support for this stance as investors and corporations start to abandon diversity pledges and other ESG-related plans. But in many ways, the Business Roundtable's push was late. Google famously said in its S-1 back in 2004 that its leaders "aspire to make Google an institution that makes the world a better place." Facebook said in its 2011 S-1, "Our mission is to make the world more open and connected." The notion that a company would stand for more than its income statement isn't new, novel, or going away. And neither Tavares nor Gelsinger had strategic pillars that were outside the bounds of what might be considered generically shareholder-friendly — control costs, enter new markets, and keep pace with industrywide trends. It's just that both Google and Facebook — now Alphabet and Meta Platforms, respectively — have more than earned the benefit of the doubt from investors that their company can stand for whatever its leaders want it to stand for. Since its IPO in 2004, Google stock has gained over 6,000% and its parent company, Alphabet, has a market cap of $2.1 trillion. Since going public in 2012, Meta stock has risen over 1,400%. Its market cap is nearly $1.5 trillion. Working "for the benefit of all stakeholders," then, seems to be something that is earned, not given to employees. Because there remains little doubt about who ranks first in that hierarchy.

Title: Behind BlackRock's ambitions to push into private markets

Time Published: 2024-12-03T10:00:01Z

Larry Fink is looking to close 2024 as he started it — by announcing a big acquisition that brings BlackRock closer to dominating private-market investing. BlackRock is set to buy HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit behemoth managing $148 billion, in an all-stock deal worth about $12 billion, the firms announced Tuesday. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive and cofounder, built the world's largest asset manager, with $11.5 trillion in assets, by packaging public markets into cheap funds for the masses. He's now been very vocal about the firm's push into the profitable private markets. This shift in strategy could lead to a more valuable BlackRock, which might just be enough for Fink, who turned 72 last month, to finally pass on the reins to his yet-to-be-named successor. In January, the firm announced that it would buy the private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, with about $170 billion in assets, for about $12.5 billion in cash and stock. The deal, its biggest one since it bought Barclays' asset-management business in 2009, closed in October. In June, it agreed to buy the data giant Preqin, which it hopes will help bring some of these more complex private strategies to a broader audience. In addition to the HPS talks, the Financial Times reported that BlackRock was eyeing a stake in Izzy Englander's $70 billion hedge fund, Millennium Management. BlackRock is not new to reshaping itself through acquisition. The Barclays deal gave the firm iShares and helped it become the passive-investing giant it now is. "I do not want us to be comfortable in our business model," Fink said during the firm's investor day in summer 2023. "I want to make sure we're questioning our business model and we are focusing on how to best serve our clients, and if we truly believe there is some great need that we need to do, we are going to reimagine who we are in our business model." Acquiring HPS could be another transformational deal for the company, helping it reach the same scale it has in public equities and bonds in private markets. HPS is set to push its alternative assets to more than $600 billion. BlackRock's private-credit business is poised to now have a combined $220 billion in client assets. The deal is expected to increase private-market fee-paying assets under management by 40% and management fees by 35%, BlackRock said. HPS was founded by CEO Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, along with Scot French and Michael Patterson, in 2007 as a unit within JPMorgan called Highbridge Capital Management. Principals from the firm bought it out in 2016 after the bank's appetite for high-risk loans waned. The three are now set to join BlackRock's global executive committee and lead a new unit combining HPS and BlackRock's existing private-credit business. The secretive firm has been at the forefront of the private-credit boom, a result of the 2008 financial crisis and banks' withdrawal from risky lending. Private players moved in to make loans to companies when Wall Street giants were reluctant to. "Our competitors refer to us as the nerds of private credit and we take no offense," French told Bloomberg in an interview in November 2023. The firm, which was previously working toward an initial public offering, caters mostly to institutional investors and has more than 760 employees in offices around the world, according to its website. BlackRock brought in more assets in the third quarter than ever before, mostly down to its index funds. But in its October earnings call, the firm's leaders were already focused on its growth engine — GIP. GIP is expected to add $250 million in management fees in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a revenue-growth story," Martin Small, BlackRock's chief financial officer, said during that call. Private-equity and credit investments are much more expensive than BlackRock's usual roster of funds and in high demand from institutions like pensions and endowments, as well as ultrawealthy investors. While BlackRock has long had an alternatives investing unit, until recently, its private-markets assets were meaningfully smaller than those of the main players in the space, such as Apollo and KKR. It's tried growing through acquisition in this space in the past. In 2018, BlackRock bought a small credit manager, Tennenbaum Capital Partners, which at that time had about $9 billion in committed client capital, but saw several investment professionals exit. BlackRock expects the private-debt market to more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. While private credit's high yields and returns have increasingly attracted wealth managers and institutions alike, the deal will likely strengthen relationships with insurance firms, which have a longer investing horizon. Ana Arsov, Moody's Ratings' global head of private credit, said the acquisition was "catapulting" BlackRock into the ranks of the top five private-credit managers and would significantly advance its private-market growth goals. "BlackRock's large installed base of insurance-client assets offers a prime opportunity to cross-sell HPS's capabilities," Arsov said. "Additionally, BlackRock's extensive distribution network of institutional investors and wealth managers opens new markets for HPS." Jump to

New Delhi, Dec 3 (PTI) Realty firm Godrej Properties Ltd has raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC and SBI Pension, through qualified institutional placement (QIP) route as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. On November 27th, the company launched its QIP issue to raise up to ₹6,000 crore. The company has raised this amount by diluting nearly 8 per cent of equity through the QIP issue, which was closed on Monday. The QIP Placement Committee of the board approved the issue price of ₹2,595 per equity share, which is at a discount of ₹132.44 (4.86 per cent of the floor price) to the floor price of ₹2,727.44 per equity share. It also approved the allocation of 2,31,21,387 equity shares to be allotted to eligible qualified institutional buyers. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Godrej Properties informed that the QIP issue saw a strong demand of around 4 times the size of the QIP. The issue also had a healthy mix of leading international and domestic investors including GIC, Blackrock, Aberdeen, Norges Bank, SBI Pension, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. As a result of the QIP, Godrej Properties said its "net worth has increased by more than 50 per cent while the equity dilution was 7.68 per cent". The company's gearing ratio will come down to below 0.2:1 from 0.7:1 as of September 30, 2024. Commenting on the fundraise, Pirojsha Godrej, Executive Chairperson, Godrej Properties Ltd, said, "We greatly appreciate the confidence and support of the investment community and will do our best to ensure we utilize this capital wisely." "This capital raise will allow Godrej Properties to significantly enhance its business development portfolio while maintaining a tremendously strong balance sheet. We remain focused on building scale through continued market share gains and margin expansion," he said. Godrej Properties has reset its scale in recent years with bookings growth of 56 per cent in 2022-23 and 84 per cent in 2023-24, he said. Pirojsha expressed confidence that the company was well positioned to deliver a 3rd consecutive year of rapid growth in booking value with 90 per cent growth in the sales bookings during the first half of this fiscal. Godrej Properties is one of the leading developers in the country. It has a major presence in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Bengaluru. It has entered into Hyderabad market recently. In the last fiscal, the company's sale bookings jumped 84 per cent to a record ₹22,527 crore, the highest among listed realty firms in 2023-24. Godrej Properties has set a target of achieving ₹27,000 crore worth of sale bookings for the 2024-25 fiscal. During the April-September period of this fiscal, Godrej Properties' sale bookings value grew 89 per cent annually to over ₹13,800 crore. This is the highest-ever booking value achieved by Godrej Properties during the first half of a fiscal year. To expand its housing business, Godrej Properties acquires land through outright purchases as well as forms partnerships with landowners for joint development. Godrej Properties has added 8 new land parcels in the first six months of this fiscal with a total estimated saleable area of about 11 million square feet and a total estimated booking value potential of around ₹12,650 crore.

Title: Tokenized Securities Exchange 21X Wins Approval from Germany’s BaFin

21X, a Frankfurt-based company building a blockchain-based exchange to list and trade tokenized securities, has received approval to go live from Germany's financial supervisory authority, BaFin. The 21X exchange, which runs on the scalable Polygon chain, plans to launch its exchange for tokenized financial instruments from its Frankfurt headquarters in the first quarter of 2025, the company said on Tuesday. The plan is to trade tokenized equity, debt securities, funds, as well as more exotic real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate or artworks that qualify as eligible financial instruments. Tokenization has become popular among traditional finance firms, with the likes of asset manager BlackRock now driving the trend. From a regulatory perspective, Europe is on the verge of welcoming a new regime for crypto assets, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the next phase of which is set to start at the end of this year. The 21X license has been issued under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime (DLTR), and is the result of an 18-month process that involved BaFin, the German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), 21X said in a press release. “This is more than just a license – it’s a revolutionary moment for capital markets,” said Max Heinzle, CEO of 21X in a statement. “For the first time ever institutional and retail investors can trade and settle tokenized securities on a fully regulated, blockchain-based exchange with the same level of trust, security and compliance as traditional markets.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Prior to that, he covered fintech for the International Business Times in London and Newsweek online.

Title: The business dynamics of London, Blair, and the crisis in France, the truth about the Parthenon marbles (good news), the diplomatic incident with Douzoglou and the Royal house of Morocco

Time Published: 2024-12-03T06:02:01Z
Full Content:
Greetings! Yesterday’s news comes from London, where the Prime Minister has been since Saturday, holding meetings with foreign investors and taking the opportunity to connect with Greek businesspeople, bankers, and various influential figures who inevitably show up whenever they sense proximity to power. Fair enough, it’s not a bad thing—after all, the Prime Minister always draws a crowd. Even if Mr. Doudonis doesn’t like it, as he pointed out on TV yesterday (SKAI), saying, “And who exactly is Mitsotakis, wanting a third term? He’s not George Washington…”—only to be reminded by the journalists of the late Andreas Papandreou, who did serve a third term. Now, you’ll find more details about London’s business matters below, but I’d like to say a few words about the famous issue of the Parthenon Marbles, which has resurfaced in recent days. The truth is that the PM’s office prefers to keep this matter out of the limelight for now, and understandably so. “It’s not the right time, and it’s harmful to us. Plus, it’s not tactful towards the new British Prime Minister to bring it up, since formally, it’s not his decision,” my source says. However, from another non-governmental source, I know that progress is being made. A formula is being sought whereby the Parthenon Marbles will return permanently, but without the British officially saying they’ve been “returned for good,” and without us agreeing to any term like “loan” in the deal. Remember that in March 2023, the Vatican, under the Pope’s directive, returned three fragments from the Parthenon’s northern frieze to Athens, now housed in the Acropolis Museum. It’s even speculated that these fragments might have been part of the same shipment as the Marbles looted by Lord Elgin, now held in the British Museum. If the plan moves forward, Greece will loan a significant archaeological artifact every six months to be displayed where the Parthenon Marbles once stood. The Prime Minister, K.M., fielded many questions during the closed session of Morgan Stanley’s event, attended by numerous corporate executives. I hear much of the discussion focused on political stability, as the City is concerned about developments in Europe, especially with France’s turbulence and Germany heading for early elections. “Greece faces no risk of political instability; we have a stable government,” K.M. assured them, emphasizing that his administration’s policies are delivering results despite Europe’s sluggish growth. Naturally, they also inquired about the government’s stance on banks, with K.M. shutting down any talk of a windfall tax on bank profits. Under new EU rules, such revenues can’t be funneled into social programs. The Prime Minister also mentioned the Thessaloniki Metro, saying, “If I wanted to describe my vision for Greece, I’d use the Thessaloniki Metro as an example. It’s an impressive public project that overcame numerous obstacles, facing resistance from all kinds of forces. It’s a state-of-the-art metro system that preserves our cultural heritage. For me, this represents the Greece of the future.” K.M. spent about 2.5 hours at a closed session organized by former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s institute, focusing on artificial intelligence. He was accompanied by Akis Skertsos and Dimitris Papastergiou, while Tony Blair had assembled an impressive group, including 2024 Chemistry Nobel Laureate Demis Hassabis, whose heritage is half Cypriot and half Singaporean. The discussion covered practical applications of AI, with a presentation of an incubator set up on Downing Street, featuring 20 scientists offering solutions across various fields. Both sides agreed on closer cooperation, as the Greek government seeks expertise in areas like healthcare services (e.g., triage), prescription management, agriculture, and road safety. At the Morgan Stanley conference, Evangelos Mytilineos stood out for his critical stance on European policies that overlook the real needs of citizens and businesses. He commented on the diminished role of the EU, which no longer plays a significant part in shaping global developments. He attributed this decline to a power struggle between soft and hard power politics, noting that Europe excelled in the former but is ill-prepared for the era of hard power. He questioned whether the aging continent could once again lead in innovation. The conference hall erupted in laughter when an investor asked whether the crisis in France and the collapse of the German government might impact the Greek economy. Someone wryly noted that 10-15 years ago, the conversation was the exact opposite—everyone was wondering if Greece’s crisis would affect Germany and France. Beyond the packed schedule, Prime Minister K.M. had a private dinner with Tony Blair last night. It’s said that Blair holds Mitsotakis in high regard, personally appreciating him. Blair perhaps sees in Mitsotakis a reflection of his own “Third Way” political model, which he implemented as Prime Minister. However, after his meetings with Morgan Stanley, discussions on artificial intelligence, and a sit-down with Keir Starmer, K.M. is set to return to Greek politics for talks with Nikos Androulakis on Wednesday. Yesterday, I mentioned the ongoing troubles of Venezuelan-born businessman Theodoros Douzoglou with the Anti-Money Laundering Authority, which remain in full swing. Today, I’ll recount a wild incident that nearly escalated into a full-fledged diplomatic episode. Last July, Queen Lalla Salma of Morocco, the first wife of King Mohammed VI (their marital status remains unclear), visited Mykonos with their eldest son, the heir to the throne, and other members of the royal family. A well-known hotel company arranged for their accommodation in some of Douzoglou’s villas in Agios Lazaros, Mykonos, due to unavailability in its own facilities. Trouble began when Douzoglou discovered that such high-profile guests were staying in his villas. He demanded additional payment from the hotel company. While this could have been settled as a simple civil dispute, things escalated. On the day of the royal family’s departure, shortly after the family members had left, black-clad men resembling bodyguards blocked the villas and prevented the royal staff from retrieving their luggage. The incident quickly reached the government via diplomatic channels, and the Greek police (ELAS) arrived within minutes. High-level orders were clear: “Anyone obstructing the royal family’s departure is to be arrested on the spot.” The mysterious men promptly disappeared, and the situation was resolved. However, the incident remains on record at the Mykonos police station. Is Greece turning into Venezuela? Following a column’s mention of potential misuse of a provision allowing Golden Visas for properties worth at least €250,000, provided they involve industrial buildings converted into residences, PASOK MP Milena Apostolaki submitted a related query to Finance Minister Kostis Hatzidakis. She noted a trend, particularly in Attica, where industrial properties are subdivided and repurposed as residential units, sold for €250,000 to third-country nationals, enabling them to acquire Golden Visas under advantageous terms. The double denial by the Prime Minister of rumors regarding a new windfall tax on banks and energy profits, coupled with the decline in 10-year bond yields (2.883%)—lower than France’s 2.921%—and the dividends announced by TERNA Energy, provided a solid boost to the stock market yesterday. A total of 34.3 million shares were traded, with 29.61 million involving the banking sector. The Banking Index surged by 4.61%, marking its best daily performance since November 14, 2023. The General Index, buoyed by the banking sector, remained positive throughout and closed at 1,424.33 points (+2.21%). It wasn’t just bank stocks that saw impressive gains. Metlen rose by 3.73% to €32.22, PPC hit €11.77 (+2.79%), TITAN hovered near €40 (€39.8, +2.71%), with BIOHALCO, HelleniQ Energy, and Motor Oil (back above €20) all contributing to the festive mood. Aegean (+2.32%) and Coca Cola (+1.91%) also added to the optimism, setting a target of 1,500 points for the index. The situation at Hellenic Defense Systems (EAS) is growing increasingly complex, making solutions harder to find. Today marks the rescheduled General Assembly of EAS shareholders, primarily the Ministry of Finance, overseen by the Ministry of Defense. The current board’s term ended on Sunday, December 1, and CEO Nikos Kostopoulos, the longest-serving CEO in EAS history, has not indicated plans for renewal. Meanwhile, company accounts are frozen pending the new board’s appointment. The assembly will decide on the new CEO, board members, and a capital increase. Regarding objections raised by ONEX over a strategic partnership between EAS and Slovakian (Czech-backed) company MSM Export for a European-funded project called ASAP, the Council of State was set to hear the case today but postponed its decision to March 18, 2025. If this date holds, March could stretch into summer—who knows what will unfold by then? Last week, EAS paid MSM Export €4 million for their ASAP share, raising questions about the legality of the payment pending the Council’s ruling. How this Gordian knot will be untangled remains to be seen. In football, Italian teams often retreat to a hotel or training center before big matches for a “ritiro” (from ritirare, meaning to withdraw), a practice that frequently delivers results. This approach is now finding its way into the corporate world. OTE plans to hold its own ritiro at a well-known Peloponnesian hotel, gathering department heads and the new leadership under Kostas Nebis, who took over a few months ago. This retreat aims to solidify the team as they execute their new strategy, set for 2030. As Nebis recently explained to journalists, this strategy rests on three pillars: growth, diversification, and transformation—focusing on improving customer service and operational efficiency. One of Greece’s largest electronics retailers advertised a camera for Black Friday with a 36% discount at €1,999, down from €3,119. However, a price history check revealed the camera cost €3,119 only last January, while in October it was priced at €2,299, making the real discount just 13%. “Fine print,” you might say, but there’s more: a TV was touted as selling for €548, the year’s lowest price, yet on September 17, it was priced at €483. “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree,” goes the saying, which fits the case of Matilda-Maria Kalliniku, daughter of Goldair Group head Kallinikos Kalliniku and Regina Golemi. The 22-year-old serves as President and CEO of the newly established “TIP TAP Solutions S.A.,” headquartered on Amalias Avenue. With an initial capital of €25,000, the company will offer services in financial intermediation, transaction processing, software development, electronic systems management, business consulting, and market research. Kallinikos Kalliniku holds the position of Vice President, while Regina Golemi completes the three-member board. Various scenarios are circulating in the market about the identity and intentions of the systematic and cautious buyer of shares in the Piraeus Port Authority. One theory points to a fund from across the Atlantic. Another suggests a major hotel group, which is either interested in or has already agreed to participate in Cosco’s €800 million investment plan. This plan includes the construction of a five-star hotel, three four-star hotels, commercial spaces, and a logistics center within the cruise passenger terminal. The main focus of this investment is the transformation of the iconic “Pagoda” building into a five-star hotel, a landmark for the area. Donald Trump has openly and bluntly declared economic war against BRICS countries. He warned—via “X” (formerly Twitter)—that nations aligning with BRICS to move away from the dollar will face 100% tariffs and must forget about exporting to the U.S. This marks the first time in history that a U.S. president has threatened 100% tariffs on imports from nine countries simultaneously. BRICS, which began in 2011 with Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, expanded this year to include Iran, the UAE, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Additionally, 34 more countries have expressed interest in joining. Trump’s warning seemingly targets them too. Simply put, global trade, as we knew it, is over. The S&P 500 index remained consistently above 6,000 points, finishing last Friday with the highest monthly gains of the past year. It’s no secret that this stellar performance is driven by the “Magnificent Seven” (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla). Since the start of 2023, these seven companies have rallied by 148%, while the other 493 S&P 500 companies rose by 35% during the same period. The overall index gained 57%, nearly three times less than the tech giants. The combined market capitalization of the “Magnificent Seven” has reached $16 trillion, equaling the total capitalization of the German, French, British, and Canadian stock exchanges. For now, “divide and conquer” is working in Europe’s favor regarding oil prices. During the last week of November, Brent crude and U.S. crude prices dropped by over 3%. This trend seems set to continue in global markets. Non-OPEC oil producers (e.g., the U.S., Canada, Guyana, and Brazil) are ignoring OPEC’s decisions and ramping up production. Meanwhile, major consumers like China are reducing demand due to the rise of electric vehicles and a slowing economy. The International Energy Agency predicts a surplus of over 1 million barrels per day. OPEC countries will meet this Thursday in a desperate bid to coordinate policies, as oil prices seem unlikely to rise above $80, staying within the $70-$75 range. Explore related questions

Title: Drinks industry veteran Patrick J Rigney invests in new Dublin brewery

Drinks industry entrepreneur Patrick J Rigney has invested in Changing Times Brewery, the newly launched beer-maker in Glasnevin, Dublin, backed by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs. Mr Rigney has been instrumental in Ireland’s drinks industry for decades, establishing brands such as Baileys as global leaders. Before establishing his own business – the Shed Distillery of PJ Rigney – he created brands including the twin-bottle Sheridan’s Irish Cream Liqueur. He also owns a distillery in Co Leitrim where he produces Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, which is his primary brand. Changing Times Brewery, located adjacent to the Royal Canal in Glasnevin, said Mr Rigney will join the group as chairman, with his involvement bringing the total investment among its backers to “over €2 million”. When the launch of the brewery was announced last month, its backers said they had put €1.8 million into the project, which would suggest Mr Rigney’s investment is in the region of €200,000. Its backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of the Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of popular bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. It is also backed by the publican families behind the Ferryman, the Long Hall, the Swan, Darkey Kellys, the Bankers, Arthur Maynes in Donnybrook, Devitts, Doheny & Nesbitts, Lemon and Duke, the Bridge 1859, the Blackrock and the Bank. The group said Mr Rigney’s investment marked his first involvement in a brewery, and said his experience in the industry would be valuable for the company. “Changing Times hope to utilise his extensive contacts, creative entrepreneurship, vast experience in bringing new brands to market and his global perspective in helping to establish and grow their brand and products,” it said. Initially the brewery’s new beers are being stocked in the pubs of its founding members, with further pubs “expected to be announced soon”. “I was greatly flattered when I was asked to get involved in Changing Times Brewery, which I think represents a real innovation in the Irish beer market,” said Mr Rigney. “The families behind this brewery are steeped in the pub heritage of Dublin and Ireland with years and years’ of experience in catering to their customer’s tastes. They are a part of the fabric of the Dublin’s social culture. “Who could be better placed to deliver authentic, refreshingly Irish, locally brewed beers. I’m excited to come on board and to help them deliver a timely change for customers at the pub counter.” Colin Gleeson is an Irish Times reporter Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SolarZero collapse: Liquidators’ first report reveals more than $40 million owed
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/solarzero-collapse-liquidators-first-report-reveals-more-than-40-million-owed/OBA77JJHWJBA5FGH6L44752YQY/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T05:10:34Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The first liquidator’s report on SolarZero reveals the company owes more than $40 million to more than 700 creditors and staff. The Kiwi-founded solar and battery firm ceased operations last week and was placed in voluntary liquidation by its sole shareholder, an investment fund controlled by US private equity giant BlackRock. Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton were appointed liquidators of the six entities – all in liquidation – that made up the Group. The reason for SolarZero’s collapse was due to it being unable to generate a profit – nor did it reach breakeven, the liquidators said. The company had 169 staff at the time of liquidation. The liquidators said they are aware of 173 preferential claims totalling $1,796,880, representing holiday pay owing to employees for accrued entitlement. Trade creditors with security are owed $3.1m. There are 598 unsecured creditors who are owed just over $34.9m. This includes $4.1m owing to trade creditors and $24.4m in intercompany payables. “At this stage, it is unknown if there will be any funds available to make payment to unsecured creditors,” the report said. The liquidator’s report also confirmed BlackRock had bought SolarZero for $110m from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price has not been previously disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. Since the acquisition, BlackRock has injected a further $147.8m into the business, the report said. Last week the company said its customers – of which is estimated to be 15,500 – would not be affected by the liquidation. The liquidator’s report said SolarZero’s cash generating assets, and associated obligations, including most of its contracts with its customers, were legally transferred into special purpose trusts controlled by Public Trust. “This means that the majority of the Group’s SolarZero customers are not creditors of any of the companies.” The Public Trust has been quoted as saying “The trusts continue to operate as a going concern and are focused on ensuring services continue for customers”. The liquidators said since their appointment they have received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. “We are keeping an interested parties register and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders,” they said. On Friday about a dozen former staff protested outside BlackRock’s Auckland office, claiming they were owed $1.4m in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We also have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000,” one of the protest organisers told the Herald. Such sums were “chump change” for BlackRock, he said. Master Electricians chief executive Alexandra Vranyac-Wheeler said 14 former installers for SolarZero were Master Electricians have come forward. The amount owed to the industry group’s members was at least $118,000. Electricians outside the group had also approached it. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Societe Generale. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations,” NZGIF said on Friday. Finance Minister Nicola Willis, who is due to meet with NZGIF executives later this week, said she was urgently seeking more information. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald last week: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract.

Title: Altcoin Boom Forecasted: Expert Predicts $1.4 Trillion Market Cap With Bitcoin At $130,000
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-boom-forecasted-bitcoin-at-130000/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T05:00:03Z

As the cryptocurrency market experiences a notable uptrend, altcoins have begun to take center stage while Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates just below its recent record high of $99,540. This shift has led to significant capital rotation toward altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) and XRP, both of which have outperformed many of the top ten cryptocurrencies over the past month. Market analyst Doctor Profit recently shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that while retail traders seem to be selling off their holdings, cryptocurrency whales are accumulating Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. According to his analysis, in the last three to five weeks, these whales have amassed $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Conversely, retail traders appear to be sidelined, primarily holding USDT as they panic-sell without clear justification. Doctor Profit also noted that Ethereum (ETH) is currently “undervalued” according to its market value to realized value (MVRV) chart and is showing signs of upward momentum. This month alone has seen 245,000 ETH in exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, with Ethereum ETFs surpassing Bitcoin ETF inflows for the first time, signaling a significant shift in institutional interest. The analyst suggests that the market is pricing in a potential altcoin-focused ETF launch in 2025, with S-1 filings made by asset managers such as Bitwise and Canaray Capital, among others, for these index funds to invest in Solana, Litecoin, XRP, and Hedera. According to Doctor Profit, the market is entering the “altcoin season” with previous periods of stagnation behind. He predicts that the upcoming XRP ETF, rumored to be launched by major financial institutions such as BlackRock and JPMorgan, will spur further interest in the altcoin market. Delving into the market’s dynamics, Doctor Profit emphasizes the importance of the Bitcoin to altcoin market cap ratio. In previous market cycles, a drop in this ratio has signaled impending corrections for Bitcoin. For instance, during the peak of April 2021, Bitcoin had a market cap of $1.2 trillion, while altcoins were valued at $984 billion, creating a healthier 50% ratio. However, when this ratio fell to 20% and later to 18%, Bitcoin faced substantial corrections. Currently, the altcoin market is undervalued relative to Bitcoin, with the ratio sitting at an extreme 95%. This discrepancy suggests that Bitcoin is overvaluing the altcoin market, which Doctor Profit views as a positive indicator for both sectors. The analyst further predicts a robust altcoin market cap of $1.4 trillion by Q1 2025, supported by anticipated altcoin ETFs, while Bitcoin could reach approximately $130,000. At the time of writing, XRP, the third largest digital asset on the market, is trading at $2.73, boasting a colossal market cap surge towards the $152 billion mark, setting a new all-time high in this metric for the token.

Title: 31.2 Patch Notes - Battlegrounds Season 9, Twist, Arena, Event, Heroic Brawl & More!

This site works best with JavaScript enabled. Please enable JavaScript to get the best experience from this site. The Great Dark Beyond Cards List & Guide Patch Notes for a 31.2 patch were just released, including Season 9 in Battlegrounds, a new event, upcoming Heroic Tavern Brawl & More! Details inside. Patch 31.2, launching tomorrow, kicks off Battlegrounds Season 9, sends an invitation to Bob's Holiday Bash, and more! On December 3 , Battlegrounds Season 8 will end and Season 9 will begin. That means ratings will reset in Battlegrounds and Duos, Trinkets will be removed, and the Battlegrounds Rewards Track will switch over. All rewards that were earned on the Season 8 track, but not yet claimed, will be automatically claimed. Learn more about the upcoming Season in our Season 9 Announcement Blog . Farseer Nobundo Exarch Othaar Zerek, Master Cloner These three new heroes will be offered in every Battlegrounds/Duos game for two weeks following their introduction in Patch 31.2. Since they will always be in the initial hero offerings each game, that also means you will NOT be able to Reroll into them during this period (because you can't Reroll into a hero that's already been offered, more on that below). Lich Baz'hial Shudderwock Marin the Manager Trade Prince Gallywix The new season will bring nearly 90 new and returning minions and 11 all-new Tavern spells across Battlegrounds and Duos! With so many changes, Bob's rolling out the minion types in groups so you can learn the new synergies, and each gets a chance to shine: You can see all the card reveals and changes now in the official Card Library . Starting with Season 9, the damage cap will be adjusted in solo Battlegrounds games (note: this change will only apply to solo Battlegrounds, not Duos). The damage cap will start at 5 damage, then go up to 10 damage on turn 4, and 15 damage on turn 8. The cap will still be removed once you're in the Top 4. This change will allow games to progress more evenly, without big bursts of damage in the early game. Starting with Season 9, you'll be able to Reroll Hero options during the Hero selection phase of your Battlegrounds games. Each Hero slot can be Rerolled once per game, using new Battlegrounds Tokens. Each Reroll will change that specific Hero into a different Hero option that hasn't been offered to any player in the lobby that game.* Each player's Rerolls are independent of other players', so you don't need to worry about timing your Rerolls to make them more effective. You can get Battlegrounds Tokens from the Rewards Track (as free rewards and with the Season Pass), in-game grants, viewership rewards, and the in-game Shop. Once Patch 31.2 goes live, all players will automatically have 2 Battlegrounds Tokens added to their account. There will also be a free bundle of 4 Battlegrounds Tokens that you can claim in the in-game Shop for a limited time after launch. Finally, with the new Battlegrounds Season Pass+, your first Reroll each game doesn't require a Battlegrounds Token. * Because you can't Reroll into a Hero that was already offered to someone in the lobby, and because the new Heroes are guaranteed to be offered in every lobby for two weeks following the patch, you will be unable to Reroll into those Heroes during that period. With Season 9, the Battlegrounds Rewards Track is being extended to add Battlegrounds Tokens throughout both the free rewards and the paid rewards from the Season Pass. There will also be a new option, the Season Pass+, that includes everything on the Season Pass plus a perk that makes it so your first Reroll each game doesn't consume a Battlegrounds Token—making it the most consistent and efficient option for people who want to maximize their Rerolls and Hero options. The Season Pass will be available for the same price as before ($14.99 USD or 1500 Runestones). The Season Pass+ will be available for $19.99 USD or 2000 Runestones. If you get the regular Season Pass and later decide you want to upgrade to the Season Pass+, you will be able to do so for $4.99 or 500 Runestones. See our Season 9 Announcement Blog for the details about all three levels of the Rewards Track. When Patch 31.2 launches on December 3 , all ongoing Arena runs will end and a new Arena season will begin. The eligible sets will be updated to the following: Twist is back! Twist returns with the Wonders format for when Patch 31.2 launches on December 3 . The Wonders format is a throwback format celebrating the early years of Hearthstone*. In it, players can make decks with cards from the following sets: Starting with Patch 31.2, Twist will no longer require that all formats start and end exactly on the first and last day of the month. This will allow for better support during those transition periods by avoiding weekends and holidays. The initial Wonders format will run from December 3 to January 6 . Seasons will still be monthly and ladder rankings will still reset with the monthly calendar. That means, for example, that the January ladder season will consist of two different formats: one from January 1-6 , and one from January 6-31 . On January 6 , the XL Wonders format will begin. XL Wonders uses the same card pool as Wonders, but allows you to build your decks with anywhere between 30 and 40 cards and then have your life total match your card total (so if you have a 37-card deck, you will begin the game with 37 max life). This means you can keep playing your Wonders deck, or add a bit more cards in once the format rolls over. What Wonders will you accomplish with freedom over your deck and life total?! We'll have more information about the February Twist season closer to when it goes live. * Before the introduction of Demon Hunter and Death Knight, so those classes are banned in both Wonders and XL Wonders. Heroic Tavern Brawl returns for the week of December 4-11 . Pay an entry fee and compete in high-stakes games until reaching either 12 wins or 3 losses, with prizing based on how well you do. Bob's hosting a holiday bash this year, with a special in-game event. From December 10 to December 31 , complete Event Quests to earn XP on the special Event XP Track. Both Hearthstone and Battlegrounds are on Bob's invite list, so Event Quests can be completed in either Mode, and progress gives rewards for both Modes. Complete the entire Event Track to earn 7 The Great Dark Beyond Packs, 4 Battlegrounds Tokens, and Bob the Bartender himself (regular and golden), for the first time in Standard Hearthstone! Bob the Bartender is planned to rotate out of Standard with the 2026 Standard rotation. Finish the year out strong with Hearthstone: Music of the Tavern (Volume 2), releasing on December 18 ! Enjoy the tunes of over 50 in-game tracks when they launch on Spotify, Apple Music, itunes, and Deezer! Artist: Uriah Voth Hello P2W. I was fine with a masked subscription fee for a static competetive advantage but this shit is strictly pay to win. correct me if I'm wrong, but Bob the Bartender would be able to deal with Unkilliax with the "Recruit a minion" option, right? Hopefully what I am seeing here from Bob the Bartender and Freeze the Shop specifically is a control tool for Rogue to get to the late game. Recruit a Minion is nice for control decks but I would stick with Mind Control Tech as it comes a turn earlier and against Ramp Druid, you'd want their Zilliax or Titan active on your side of the board immediately rather in hand. I think Bob will be tried out but I don't he is necessarily valuable for any deck. I mean you can get similar freeze the board effect with Sleepy Resident for example. Let me guess you can't craft Bob, right? Just like the Alliance/Horde spell from the current event. So this is gonna be a thing now? What about new and returning players? I can't believe it. These cards are even really fun and better than the average card IMO. I don't even know anymore with Hearthstone. It could be such a fun game but then they do things like that. I think until now it was maybe annoying to get some cards but now you literally can't anymore. Why are they doing this? Well, at least for me that means I really shouldn't play much anymore. Because why would I if the most fun cards aren't even available to people anymore. To be fair most people don't even like to play that way. But maybe in the future I thought we could have more social stuff like groups and I could play with people that are more like me. But now... this... I guess... it was to be expected... but I still feel disappointed. thats a lot of words for i dont want to play the game and want everything to be obtainable by spending money Bob about to see a lot of play in my Priest deck literally the artwork of the wrong N'zoth for the Twist promo art "Is Heroic Brawl worth it for me?"Short answer: No. Long answer: No, it is a scam set up to drain your gold reserves ahead of the miniset launching next month so you're more likely to have to spend real money on it instead. i dont know how much gold we will spend on 1 run? If still 150 it will be a boom I truly don’t understand why people get so angry about the brawl. If you’re a bad player or a player with a terrible deck wasting your gold on the brawl, then you deserve what happens to you. The brawl is only good for the very best players with great decks. I don’t understand the appeal of the brawl. I’ve never felt the desire to participate in it. I didn’t even play in the latest brawl (the one that was right before this expansion). The timing of the brawl has NOTHING to do with it being a “scam.” Even if it were after the mini-set, bad players shouldn’t participate. By the way, it’s totally fine if you just want to play it for fun. I’m talking about bad players who expect to maximize their gold and number of packs by winning in the brawl. Imagine a random player thinking they can profit from the brawl, saying, “I am rank 4284387 legend. I am so good at the game. Obviously, I will get at least 10 wins in this brawl.” LOL PS: I just want to make it clear: when I said “bad player,” I’m including diamond and low-legend players as well. It always makes me laugh how much players hate on Heroic Tavern Brawl, when it is basically a lite version of what "tournament mode" would be which is something we complain endlessly about not having. Face it guys - if you suck at the game, any competitive mode is going to be a losing proposition for you. So play it for fun, or don't play it. gotta love the flexers above pretending that a 12-2 or better win rate is consistently possible for the event to be even considered a profitable investment of time and gold."buh you get packs for less wins"yeah for a set I already have a meta-viable collection of. Oh boy! I cant wait for them to get rid of trinkets: (one of the funnest and most exciting mechanics they've ever added to BGs) and replace it with NOTHING again!!! And wow, I cant wait to get reroll tokens (a feature designed for tier-wh*re players who will choose the highest WR character every time because they care about imaginary rank points which don't actually give you any in-game rewards) instead of hero skins from the free tavern pass! Best season ever! IMO it's time for battleground to have its own game, I'm tired of seeing all these updates for a mode I don't even play. I think BG players would like this too, especially if they don't play constructed mode. Sign In Help Advertise Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2024 Magic Find, Inc. All rights reserved.

Title: Bitcoin And Ether ETFs Set Record $7.6 Billion Inflows Amid Trump’s Crypto Push
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-ether-etfs-set-record-7-6-billion-inflows-amid-trumps-crypto-push/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T22:30:36Z

Analysts said that two of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world are riding on the waves of positive sentiments as the exchange-traded funds of Bitcoin and Ethereum reached record highs. The pro-cryptocurrency stance of US President-elect Donald Trump continues to fuel the positive outlook, propelling BTC and ETH to attain unprecedented levels. Analysts showed that as of November, the firstborn cryptocurrency’s exchange-traded funds (EFT) recorded an all-time high of $6.5 billion in net inflows, a significant milestone attributed to the incoming Trump administration. Many market commentators are predicting that Bitcoin could soon hit a record high of over $100,000 per coin; even American author Robert Kiyosaki posted on his X account that BTC would settle at around $250,000 in 2025. Analysts mentioned that since the start of 2024, BTC’s price has already doubled, and they observed that the crypto went up by 45% after the US presidential election, noting that investors’ optimism on cryptocurrencies can be attributed to Trump’s promise to make regulations more friendly to digital assets. As of press time, Bitcoin has been traded at $95,721, down by 1.8% in the last 24 hours and with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. BTC is moving even closer to the $100,000 mark but continues to struggle to pass this resistance level. Crypto analysts commented that since Trump’s election, Ethereum has outmatched Bitcoin as the leading altcoin has reached new heights, riding on the overall optimism in the cryptocurrency sector. Reports illustrated that the Ethereum ETFs hit an all-time high of $1.1 billion in net inflows, saying that ETH is keeping up with the Bitcoin surge. Analysts noted that a net inflow of $333 million was recorded from nine Ether EFTs on November 29, adding that BlackRock led the charge wherein its ETHA had a total inflow of $2.1 billion. In the last week of November, SosoValue revealed that Ether ETFs garnered more than $466 million while having an outflow of $71.60 million in the prior week. Moreover, its price also increased by 48% in the last seven days. According to CoinGecko, the largest altcoin is being traded at $3,619 with a total market capitalization of more than $435 billion. In a post, digital asset analyst Markus Thielen suggested that Bitcoin’s supply might be drying up, noting that there is a dwindling Bitcoin balance on cryptocurrency exchanges. “Unlike late summer, when a sudden large inflow temporarily replenished exchange balances, this time, no additional inventory is appearing,” Thielen said on LinkedIn. The analyst said that Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase are the only crypto exchanges with sufficient Bitcoin in their inventories. Some reports suggested that the latest inflows into BTC are significant, and a bearish outlook might be premature. However, he noted that the crypto’s market capitalization is growing but its dominance waning down by 60% to 56%. Could this indicate that the altcoin season has arrived?

Title: Salinas Loses $5.5 Billion in a Day on Elektra Slump

(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Grupo Elektra tumbled 71% on Monday as trading resumed following a months-long halt, wiping off $5.5 billion from the fortune of billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego and pushing him out of the world’s top 500 wealthiest list. Shares of Elektra ended the session at 274.27 pesos per share compared to a 944.95 price where they last traded in July. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores said in a filing early Monday that it had been asked by regulators to let the stock trade even it blew past circuit breakers in the premarket auction — a mechanism which had barred it from resuming for days. Trading resumed even as Elektra said in a statement before market open that it had a court order keeping it blocked, adding that anyone dealing in the stock could be held responsible. “It is our obligation to reiterate that the resumption of trading in these, in addition to causing irreparable damage, could involve shares obtained improperly,” Grupo Salinas spokesman Luciano Pascoe said in a response to questions. 4-Month Halt Salinas himself had triggered the trading halt back in July, alleging he was a victim of potential fraud. His lawyers claimed a creditor had used the company’s shares to fund a $110 million loan, and later discovered most of the shares appeared to have been sold, pushing the stock price down. The rest, they say, was pocketed by the creditor, who has denied any wrongdoing. “It is important to remember that any eventual consequences are the exclusive responsibility of their buyers and sellers,” Pascoe said. After a month of no trading, Elektra got booted from the country’s main stock gauge. Now, it’s facing selling pressure from exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Inc and The Vanguard Group, which need to dump shares. Volume on Monday surged to a more than seven year high. Officials had been trying for days to lift the halt, but the low bids immediately triggered a market circuit breaker designed to limit volatility, suspending it again. Lawyers for Salinas had argued to keep the stock from trading, saying it would cause “irreparable damage to the company.” $5.5 Billion Salinas’ nearly 75% stake in the company is now worth about $2.2 billion, down from $7.6 billion on Friday. That gives him a net worth of $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Salinas, 69, has long been the third-wealthiest Mexican behind Carlos Slim and German Larrea. Heading into this week, he was ranked the world’s 262nd-richest-person by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With the plunge, Salinas is no longer on the list of the 500 wealthiest people. Beyond Salinas’ stake, ETFs and other index-tracking funds hold around 4 million in shares out of 47.8 million in free floating shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the slump is vaporizing Salinas’ wealth on paper — which had been a key fixture of his ability to take loans out against Elektra’s value — it could make a bid to de-list the shares easier. Elektra said last week it would hold a meeting in late December to discuss taking the company private. --With assistance from Carolina Wilson.

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Among Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top Stock Picks Heading Into 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks. Ken Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors. Fisher said, "I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused." Besides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors. In the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips. READ ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams’ Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks. Even though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better. "Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly," Ken Fisher said. Ken Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the "magnificent seven" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions. "If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find.

Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: $8.32 Billion Number of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a company that built its name as a retail giant on the sale of consumer products and advertising. It has since diversified its business empire with investments in cloud computing and the sale of electronic devices. About 38% of online sales in the US happen in the company's online store. Consequently, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of e-commerce industry sales. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is succeeding in fending off competition in online sales. The launch of ultra-cheap products through Amazon Haul has strengthened its edge in attracting more sales through the mobile-only marketplace. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also boasts the largest cloud computing unit. Amazon Web Services is emerging as a key growth and profit driver amid the digital revolution. Grandview Research expects the cloud market to grow by about 21% annually by 2030. Likewise, AMZN should be the biggest beneficiary as it controls 33% market share in the segment. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also invests in artificial intelligence solutions to enhance its cloud computing solutions. Consequently, AWS sales rose by 19% in the third quarter to $27.5 billion. The increase came as the company rolled out new services, improvements, and solutions for its cloud unit and e-commerce site. Parnassus Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the quarter slightly down, so our underweight position contributed to relative return. We added the stock after the share price declined significantly, and the timing of the purchase proved beneficial: after we initiated the position, shares rebounded strongly as sentiment around the consumer improved.” Overall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks. Ken Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors. Fisher said, "I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused." Besides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors. In the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips.

Even though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better. "Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly," Ken Fisher said. Ken Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the "magnificent seven" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions. "If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward", Fisher said in a video interview.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

This might force Google to make some of its technology stack available to partners and offer search text ads for one year to U.S. partners while keeping just 10% of gross revenue. “In tandem with this, Google is only allowed to syndicate 25% of search text ads, meaning that partners (like an Apple) would need to backfill their remaining search ads either through their own tech stack or through a new partner like Bing,” Lenschow added. “This, in theory, would open up a unique opportunity for Microsoft to capture share for a period of time.” Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management’s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.” Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: An Intel Break-Up Could Follow Its CEO Shake-Up, Bank of America Says
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/intel-break-up-could-follow-ceo-shake-up-bank-of-america-stock-8753963
Time Published: 2024-12-02T21:27:24Z

Intel (INTC) could break up its operations after CEO Pat Gelsinger's sudden retirement was announced Monday, according to Bank of America analysts. The analysts wrote Monday that Intel's internal manufacturing business and the foundry business that makes chips for other companies are now more likely to be separated, as the outgoing CEO was a proponent of keeping them together. Such a shake-up would still face a number of hurdles, like the strings attached to the nearly $8 billion in federal CHIPS Act funding announced last week. The BofA analysts said that the funding agreement dictates that Intel needs to retain at least a 35% stake in its foundry business. "Both businesses are undergoing their own strategic, structural, financial, and competitive issues, with no near term solution in sight," the analysts wrote, maintaining their "underperform" rating and $21 price target on the shares. Intel's stock finished Monday slightly lower. While Intel shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year, some of the company's few bright spots have come from reports of potential investments or acquisition offers, or after the chipmaker sold pieces of some assets. Bloomberg and Reuters reported Monday that Gelsinger met with the chipmaker's board last week over its concerns about the company's turnaround effort and its progress in catching up to competitors like Nvidia (NVDA)—and allegedly was given the choice to retire or be fired.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq close at record highs as tech surges to kick off December

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed at record highs on Monday as stocks kicked off the final month of a banner 2024 on a high note. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% to extend its recent record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped almost 0.3% from its recent all-time closing high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite popped almost 1%, with Apple (AAPL) shares also touching a record. Other tech stocks gained including Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META), both up more than 3%. The S&P 500 and Dow are entering December on a roll, having ended November with their best monthly gains in a year. The rally got a boost last month thanks to optimism around President-elect Donald Trump's victory. Year to date, the benchmark S&P is up over 25%, while the Dow has gained nearly 20%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained nearly 30%. In individual stocks, shares in Jeep maker Stellantis (STLA) sank after CEO Carlos Tavares suddenly resigned. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) stock ended lower after the company said its CEO, Pat Gelsinger, had retired from the struggling chipmaker. Investors are starting to count down to the November jobs report on Friday, a key input for the Federal Reserve's policy making, as well as to job openings and private payrolls readings. A surprise monthly jobs print could reset the expectations for rate cuts that have supported stocks' stellar performance this year. That said, bets on a slower path of Fed easing haven't made a significant dent in the recent appetite for stocks. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX=F) climbed as investors assessed Trump's latest tariff threat. The incoming president warned BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) not to create a rival to the US currency, saying on Saturday that they will face 100% tariffs if they move away from it. Trump has already put markets on alert with promises to hit Canada, Mexico, and China with big new tariffs. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy The Nasdaq and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday as investors looked ahead towards a crucial jobs report later this week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% to notch a new all-time closing high while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped almost 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped nearly 1% with tech stocks leading the gains. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks gained, with Apple (AAPL) touching new highs. Tesla (TSLA) shares also gained on the heels of bullish calls. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed just above the flat line. On Friday, investors will receive crucial labor market data, which could give the Federal Reserve more clues on whether it should hold rates steady or continue its cutting cycle. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet later this month. Fed governor Christopher Waller said on Monday he's leaning toward supporting another rate cut, but he may change his mind if inflation data surprises to the upside. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said on Monday he leans toward supporting another rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee meets this month, but he may change his mind if inflation data surprises to the upside. "Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2% over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting," Waller said during prepared remarks at a conference in D.C. on Monday. He went on to say, "But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation." “I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help me make my decision as to what path to take,” added Waller. The FOMC is expected to meet on Dec 17 and 18. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: Donald Trump's latest tariff threat appears to have stemmed at least in part from a nascent blockchain-based entrant into the influential world of global financial messaging. The president-elect's move came in a Saturday afternoon post where he promised 100% tariffs on countries looking to move away from the dollar. "[A]ny Country that tries should wave goodbye to America," he wrote. The target was an organization called BRICS, which currently boasts 10 nations and is led by the Western adversaries of China and Russia. One new product offering appears to be a key stumbling block. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports; The end of the holiday weekend added two fresh examples of a historic shift on Wall Street: More CEOs than ever are heading for the exits. Over the past 24 hours, the leaders of chipmaker Intel (INTC) and auto giant Stellantis (STLA) have both announced their departures, bolstering the CEO turnover tally. The leadership changes highlight the idiosyncrasies and challenges of each company — from a struggling auto lineup to a too-late computer chip turnaround. But they also reflect a broader trend across corporate America. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: The Stellantis (STLA) 2024 roller coaster hit a new low with CEO Carlos Tavares’s abrupt resignation on Sunday. Stellantis’ senior independent director Henri de Castries said in a statement that “in recent weeks different views have emerged,” which have resulted in the board and Tavares parting ways. “Speculation is likely to be rife as to what has happened, but it was already known that Tavares would resign in 2026 at the end of his contract and a search for his successor was underway. That leaves the main question — why now?” HSBC analyst Mike Tyndall wrote in a short note Monday morning. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock jumped to a session high by mid-day trading on Monday, gaining more than 30% after the server maker announced that the final findings from an independent review of its business found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. The company, which partners with Nvidia (NVDA) to provide high-tech servers with its AI chips, also said it will look for a new chief financial officer based on recommendations of the special committee conducting the review. Its current financial chief, David Weigand, will continue to serve in that position until his successor is appointed. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector hit an all-time high on Monday. XLY, which houses names like Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA), was up roughly 1% during the session. Year to date, the sector has gained more than 25%. US manufacturing activity may be slowly climbing out of its slump. On Monday, the ISM Manufacturing PMI showed a reading of 48.4 in November, an increase from the 46.5 seen last month and above economists' expectations for a reading of 47.5. This marked the highest reading for the index since June 2024, though notably the reading coming in under 50 indicates overall contraction in the sector. The sector has been above the 50 mark just once since October 2022, but Monday's reading could be an early sign that "better days lie ahead," according to Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons. "Looking ahead, we see significantly more positive signs for the U.S. manufacturing outlook than negative ones," Simons wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "Rate cuts will slow into next year, but more are coming. The Trump administration is focused on doing things that (it thinks) will improve U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing, including deregulation, a more accommodative tax environment, and protectionist tariffs. The jury is still out on the net benefit of the tariffs, but the other positive forces are unambiguous." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: BlackRock (BLK) is close to making a $12 billion bet that would take it deeper into the hottest trade on Wall Street: private credit. The world’s largest money manager is discussing a deal to buy HPS Investment Partners, a firm run by three ex-employees of Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that specializes in lending money to riskier companies. The transaction of $12 billion or more could be announced as soon as this week, according to reports in the Financial Times and Bloomberg. The deal could also still fall apart. Rad more there. Yahoo Finance's Yasmin Khorram reports: Tesla (TSLA) investors have good reason to watch the bromance between billionaire CEO Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump very closely. If the close relationship continues, it could eventually prove quite lucrative for the electric vehicle maker. Trump's transition team is looking for policymakers for the Department of Transportation and one of its agencies, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to spearhead self-driving regulation, likely easing the rules to enable faster development, according to a report by Bloomberg. However, experts interviewed by Yahoo Finance say changing the rules of the road may be a lot more complicated. Currently, self-driving is regulated on a state-by-state basis, and Tesla likely does not have the technology nailed down for total autonomous driving. Read more here. Tech stocks helped lift the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to record intraday highs on Monday morning. Shares of Apple (AAPL) rose 1% to touch a new record. All of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks gained in early trading, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares jumped as much as 12% in early trading after the server maker said an independent review of its business by a special committee found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. "The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee does not give rise to any substantial concerns about the integrity of the Company’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate," the company said in a filing to the SEC. Super Micro also said it is searching for a new CFO. Its current financial chief, David Weigand, will continue to serve in that position until his successor is appointed. Shares of the server maker have been on a roller coaster ride after an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research claimed accounting malpractice. Last month, Super Micro hired a new auditor, BDO, after its accountant, EY, resigned in late October. Tesla stock (TSLA) rose more than 3% in early trading amid bullish analyst commentary. The gains in the stock helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). Roth MKM upgraded shares of the electric vehicle giant to Buy from Hold, while Stifel raised its price target on the stock from $287 to $411 per share. Tesla's shares have surged amid optimism surrounding CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump. The stock is up more than 40% since the presidential election on Nov. 5. US stocks were little changed on Monday, holding near record highs, as investors awaited an important monthly jobs report at the end of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was relatively flat, coming off a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed on the heels of the index's own all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.2%. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks gained in early trading, while Utilities (XLU) and Industrials (XLI) slipped. On Monday, Intel (INTC) shares gained after the struggling semiconductor maker said CEO Pat Gelsinger had stepped down as of Dec. 1. Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired and stepped down from the board of directors, effective Dec. 1, according to the company. Intel shares were up more than 4% in premarket trading following the announcement. In a statement, Intel said it has named David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs while the board of directors conducts a search for a new CEO. The semiconductor giant has struggled to keep up with peers or implement an effective turnaround plan amid a series of quarters of declining revenue. The stock is down over 50% year to-date. In November, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and replaced by rival Nvidia (NVDA). Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI (November final); Construction spending (October); ISM Manufacturing & prices paid (November) Earnings: Zscaler (ZS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: Jobs report to test stock rally's staying power: The week ahead Stellantis stock sinks as CEO's early exit leaves void Bezos backs AI chipmaker vying with Nvidia at $2.6B value Trump's pick to run FCC is an ominous sign for Big Tech New Biden strike on China's chips to hit toolmakers President Biden pardons his son Hunter despite promise Dollar faces treacherous December as Trump, rate risks boil over Trump’s Plans Risk Inflating Bullish Stock Market Into a Bubble It may be the holiday season on Wall Street, but that doesn't mean analysts aren't out and about making calls into year-end. Here are three notes that caught my attention before 6 a.m. ET. After a recent management meeting, JPMorgan's longtime retail analyst Matt Boss is upgrading his rating on Gap (GAP) to Overweight (Buy equivalent). His price target went to $30 from $28. "With the foundation set under CEO Richard Dickson to support a consistent playbook of improved merchandising & marketing across all four brands, we see Gap at an inflection point to support low-to-mid-single-digit sales growth, annual operating margin expansion targeting historical levels of profitability," Boss said. A recent chat I had with Dickson helps to shed light on Boss's call. There is more going on here besides me shopping more at Banana Republic Factory, and additional insight on the analyst vibe on Gap can be found via Yahoo Finance's analyst recommendation tool. Ahead of Lululemon's (LULU) earnings on Dec. 5, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez is sticking with a Neutral rating (Hold equivalent) on the stock. But it's this call out on the stock from Lejuez that caught my eye: "Short interest currently sits at 6% of the float, above the 4% level three months ago and the highest short interest level in two years. Based on our conversations with investors, sentiment on Lulemon remains negative on the trajectory of Lululemon's US business, although most expect a sales/EPS beat in 3Q (driven by stronger international sales) and do not see another 2024 EPS guide down this quarter. Most bearish investors believe it will be difficult for Lululemon to grow EPS in 2025." Here is more on Lululemon's short interest and other stats from the Yahoo Finance platform. Veteran tech analyst Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI is hiking his price target on Netflix (NFLX) to $950 from $775 per share. Netflix stock currently trades at $886. Mahaney called Netflix shares a "small buy" and reiterated an Outperform rating. "At a high level, what our survey results and recent events (e.g., Q3 EPS and the massive success of the Tyson-Paul fight) suggest is that Netflix is in the strongest position financially, fundamentally and competitively that we have ever seen," Mahaney wrote. "Its overall streaming leadership — in terms of both market share and content quality — is commanding. And the clearly positive churn intent and price sensitivity results across all three of this quarter’s surveys are material positives for a subscription business. We also see four notable near-term catalysts — Christmas Day NFL games, the 12/26 release of Squid Games II, WWE Raw in January, and pending price increases," he added.

Title: AI Is All Picks And Shovels, No Gold

Time Published: 2024-12-02T20:53:57Z

When it comes to AI you may be better off betting on the the suppliers—the “pick and shovel” ... [+] providers. Nvidia has become a household word these days. As a holder since 2015, I have experienced the growth stages of the stock—along with the sell offs—for almost ten years. Some of those stages were short lived—like the crypto mining rush and the gaming rush. Today’s almost universal worshipping of the company has a very different tone though. There are few investors taking the other side of this trade. Here are some of my concerns: This last point troubles me the most. Why are investors so enchanted by AI? AI has seduced investors, companies and curious onlookers with its potential to reshape industries. From IBM’s Watson to ChatGPT’s ability to mimic human conversation, we’ve come a long way in “narrow AI” advancements. These narrow successes pave the way for dreams of “general AI”—a system that truly mimics human intelligence. But the road from wishful innovation to transformative reality has yet to be constructed. We should expect AI advances to show up in repetitive tasks, call centers and other low-level functions. But we should be careful thinking that AI will advance beyond that. Why is that? Despite its early wins, AI still trails behind in the simplest of human tasks. It can play chess, write college admissions essays and solve complicated equations but ask it to play charades or navigate a tumbleweed on the highway and you’ll be very disappointed. Computers excel in training and processing unimaginable amounts of data. But intelligence that rivals the human brain—running on 0.3 kWh and the size of two fists—is still a distant dream. Investors have largely ignored this observation. While “breakthroughs” dominate headlines, the underlying theoretical progress remains slow. Theorists are leading the way, questioning fundamental approaches, while experimentalists—the coders—tinker with existing frameworks. But you can’t invest in theorists. Investors have worked around this by identifying other ways to invest. Last year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the “pick and shovel” providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, “When everyone is looking for gold, it’s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. So far with Big Tech spending at an all-time high—fueled by a fear of being left behind—the pick-and-shovel approach has been paying dividends. But I don’t think this trend can continue indefinitely. At its core, AI today is more artificial than intelligent. While the technology marches forward, human common sense—embedded in our brains, shaped by bodies and honed through experience—remains far out of reach. The AI gold rush may continue for now, but savvy investors will look beyond the glitter to the tools fueling the frenzy. Here are two early warning signals I have used as AI sell triggers: DeepSouth and other inventions might be that better mousetrap. Yet hardly anyone is considering this possibility. If DeepSouth’s pending demonstration is successful it could shift all business away from Nvidia in a short time. It could transform the entire industry and produce many casualties. Regarding the Great Enlightenment, a few analysts are beginning to ask about the buildout and timing of possible dividends. So I think the dawn of the Great Enlightenment—that forces a reevaluation of today’s runaway spending—has begun. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum. While riding the AI wave has been exciting and profitable, it may be time to consider stepping off the surfboard. Disclosure: Andersen Capital owns the referenced stocks in this article.

Title: Here’s How Wall Street Expects S&P 500 To Perform In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/12/02/heres-how-wall-street-expects-sp-500-to-perform-in-2025/

Most major banks call for a third consecutive year of strong returns for the S&P 500, the benchmark stock index tracking 500 of the largest public American companies, offering a welcome bullish signal for investors already enjoying a historic bull market. Can the stock market replicate the 20%-plus gains hit each of the next two years? Bank of America: BofA predicts the mark of the bullish beast, setting a 6,666 target for the S&P by the end of next year. That’s a 10% projected rise from Monday’s 6,050 price for the index. Among the tailwinds cited by the strategists led by Savita Subramanian include macroeconomic factors like lower interest rates and higher labor market productivity as well as a more favorable corporate backdrop with accelerating earnings and a potentially lower tax rate under President-elect Donald Trump. And “the average stock is more attractive than the overall index,” Subramanian said in a Monday call with reporters, explaining the “average stock is actually pretty inexpensive” with the last two years’ rally driving almost entirely by a handful of mega-cap technology stocks. BMO Capital Markets: The Canada-based firm has a 6,700 price target for the S&P, predicting an 11% gain. “Earnings growth is actually understated” and “the train has left the station” with the prospect of further gains as the Federal Reserve further lowers interest rates, BMO’s chief investment strategist Brian Belski told CNBC on Monday. “ Deutsche Bank: The German-based bank has a Wall Street high end-of-2025 price target of 7,000 for the S&P. The Binky Chadha-led strategist group calls for about 16% further gains for American equities. “Various aspects” of the economic cycle should support a further advance, including increased capital expenditures outside of big technology, a boost from overseas economic recovery and a likely bump in mergers and acquisitions activity, according to Chadha. Evercore ISI: The tech-focused boutique bank set a 6,600 target for the S&P by the middle of 2025 following the election. The bull market is “still an infant,” wrote strategists led by Julian Emanuel. Yet the recent stalling of the post-election stock rally – the S&P is up less than 1% over the last four weeks– indicates the market is in a “digestion phase,” Emanuel told Bloomberg recently. Goldman Sachs: The investment bank predicted in a note to clients the S&P will end next year at 6,500, a 9% gain from Monday. It’s a view “predicated on continued U.S. economic expansion” and bolstered by the forecasted 11% earnings per share growth for the 500-company index. Notably, the Goldman group led by David Kostin predicts 2025 will be the slimmest relative outperformance of the “magnificent seven” stocks of the U.S.’ seven largest companies since 2017, reversing a trend of extended market-beating returns from the group led by AI leader Nvidia and iPhone maker Apple. Morgan Stanley: The Goldman rival has a matching 6,500 12-month price target for the S&P, the group led by Michael Wilson shared in a note. Morgan Stanley has a balmier 13% EPS growth forecast than Goldman, but shared the potential for “wider than normal” risks to its forecast due to “the potential uncertainty that the recent election outcome introduces.” Wilson set a bull case target of 7,400 for the S&P, implying a potential 26% advance, and a 4,600 bear case target, indicating a possible 28% correction. UBS: UBS Global Wealth Management has a 6,600 target for the S&P by the end of 2025, indicating a slightly more bullish 10% gain. The election “likely pulled forward the timing” of the returns associated with optimism from President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, wrote Jason Draho, the group’s head of asset allocation, Americas, wrote to clients last week. Yardeni Research: The influential independent research firm led by has a balmy 7,000 target by the end of next year, implying a 19% gain. “Trump 2.0 represents a major regime change that’s bullish for the economy and stocks,” Yardeni wrote last week. This is the “highest concentration market in 100 years,” Kostin said in a conference call with reporters. “But you look out longer term…the history of a high concentration market is it doesn't persist. It eventually fades. You get a broadening of the market.” No surprise considering the often unpredictable nature of financial markets, price targets even from the most trusted names on Wall Street can prove imperfect. Last November, Goldman and Morgan Stanley projected the S&P to end 2024 at 4,700 and 4,500, respectively, both more than 25% below Monday’s price. 10,000. That’s where the bullish Yardeni predicts the S&P could climb to 10,000 by the end of 2029, forecasting a strong 16% annualized return. Up 27% year-to-date, the S&P is on track to top 2023’s 23% gain, excluding dividends. This would be the first time the index rose at least 20% in consecutive years since 1995 to 1998 during the internet boom. The S&P’s 58% gain dating back to the end of 2022 has it on pace for its best two-year gain since the late 1990s. Driving much of the S&P’s recent success, which came in the face of a historically challenging high-rate environment, were big technology stocks, with the likes of Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all gaining more than 150% since the end of 2022.

On Monday, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reiterated its equal-weight rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE:NYSE:T) with a price target of $19.00. The rating comes as AT&T prepares to host its Analyst and Investor Day on Tuesday in Dallas, which will be webcast live starting at 2pm ET. In a note to clients, analysts at Morgan Stanley detailed their expectations of the event. The focus of the event is set to be on the company’s investment-led growth strategy and capital allocation plans. "We expect the company to announce a new buyback program, and an expanded fiber build program, while the company may provide some preliminary financial expectations for 2025," Morgan Stanley said in its note to investors. AT&T's stock has seen a 16% increase in the past three months, outperforming Verizon (NYSE:VZ)'s 6% despite recent rises in long-term interest rates. AT&T's stock currently trades at just over 10 times earnings and offers a free cash flow (FCF) yield of over 10%, with the company proposing a competitive dividend yield of approximately 5%. Morgan Stanley expects AT&T to reveal a multi-year buyback program in the $5-8 billion range per year, which could equate to about 6% of shares outstanding over two years. For 2024, AT&T has guided to approximately $17-18 billion in free cash flow, which includes around $3 billion from DTV. Dividends are expected to be just over $8 billion. The firm suggests that AT&T is likely to maintain leverage at around the 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA range over time, aiming to reach their net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 2.5x by the first half of 2025. In terms of fiber expansion, Morgan Stanley expects AT&T to extend its current in-region fiber build target from 30 million to 40-45 million consumer and business locations by the end of 2025. The company has noted the benefits of convergence between fiber and wireless services, with about 40% of fiber customers also subscribing to AT&T wireless services. Additional details are anticipated regarding the Gigapower Fiber joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), which initially targeted passing 1.5 million fiber locations, as well as other fiber partnerships out of region. While formal guidance for 2025 may not be provided at the upcoming meeting, AT&T is expected to discuss key trends for the next year, including resilient wireless service revenue growth and the potential for consistent growth in consumer wireline backed by fiber. Morgan Stanley is also interested in AT&T's cost efficiency opportunities, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence for productivity, which could contribute to modest EBITDA growth in 2025.

After an independent review revealing no board or audit committee misbehavior, Super Micro Computer (SMCI, Financials) shares soared about 30% on Monday. The Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) partner will replace its CFO in line with improvements in governance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Initiated after auditor Ernst & Young resignation for governance and internal control issues, the special committee's review found no need for financial restatements. Since then, Super Micro has hired BDO USA as its new auditor and sent Nasdaq a compliance report meant to stop delisting. Over three months, the assessment turned significant procedural flaws but no proof supporting Ernst & Young's claims. Former vice president of finance Kenneth Cheung has been appointed chief accounting officer per committee recommendations. To improve governance, the business intends to name a new general counsel, chief compliance officer, and chief financial officer. Super Micro does not plan to restate financial reporting for fiscal year 2024 or other years; it intends to achieve Nasdaq's listing criteria within the discretionary time. Super Micro has been especially close to Nvidia, incorporating its GPUs into its server systems to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning uses. This cooperation has improved Super Micro's standing in the market for artificial intelligence servers. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal.

This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect.

"The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown.

They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect.

They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver.

This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a trade-in for $5/month for 36 months (three years), which amounts to $180. The deal requires the Unlimited Ultimate plan for the line that's using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you switch phones before the 36 months period, you'll have to pay off the remaining balance of phone. New and existing Verizon customers can trade-in any phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung to get the iPhone 16 Pro free. You must keep the iPhone 16 Pro for 36 months (three years) to keep the deal active, and can't upgrade to a new phone. The line that's using this deal must have or upgrade to Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan. You also need service plans for the free iPad and Apple Watch. There may be a one-time $35 activation fee. It's possible to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max with this deal, but it would cost $5/month for 36 months. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's top-end phone in 2024, set apart from its Galaxy S24 siblings and most of the premium phone competition with its four cameras, giant 6.8-inch display, stunning battery life, and included S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a large 6.8-inch display and one of the best battery test results we've seen in a phone. The Pixel 9 Pro shares the same performance, first-rate three-lens camera system, super-bright Actua display, and Gemini AI suite with a free year of Gemini Advanced. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, but you'll be slowed to 4G LTE speeds after using 40GB. New customers can get half off their first three months when they pay up front. We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month. The MVNO is also heavily discounting several phones from their standard starting prices, including up to $500 off the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24).

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system. The V15 Detect Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum is one of Dyson's most powerful models. It features HEPA filtration and laser illumination to reveal hidden debris. This model usually runs north of $700, but it's 40% off right now. We've never seen it priced this low. The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is just $50, and is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food.

It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility. This multi-styler comes with six different options for brush heads, complete with a styling comb, filter cleaning brush, travel bag, and storage case. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world.

It’s an incredible value and includes three gorgeous color stories ideal for holiday parties and beyond. The most recently confirmed shade of Taylor Swift's iconic red lipstick, this warm brown-ish red was worn by Taylor to a 2024 Chiefs game. This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. Apple's latest generation of AirPods features a new design to optimize comfort for wearers of every kind. It's powered by the H2 chip and uses a smaller case than ever. Apple's base AirPods are now available with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) without the use of in-ear tips. The new model uses the brand's H2 chip to power features like Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness. Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and noise canceling in a sleek, comfy design that’s tough to beat. Apple's update to the AirPods Max finally moves the headphones to USB-C charging and five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware and audio performance are largely the same. The Sonos Ace are the comfiest headphones we've reviewed. They also offer great noise-canceling and audio quality that rival top models from the competition. Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer noise-canceling performance that’s much better than it should be for the money, alongside solid sound quality and massive battery life. Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra once more put the brand on top, with best-in-class noise canceling wrapped in a sleek and comfy design. The Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian are the same as the standard Studio Pro wireless headphones, but with a color curated by Kim Kardashian. They are designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. We've spotlighted The Ultra Puffer in our round up of the best Abercrombie Cyber Monday deals because it's a lookalike to Aritzia's SuperPuff and only costs $120 (plus, you can get it for an extra 15% off with the code CYBERAF). "It's a bit puffy, but that's balanced nicely by the short silhouette and faux fur accents," writes freelance author Talia Ergas. "The hood is detachable, which gives me two looks in one. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out." Find more outerwear at a discount in our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals on women's winter coats. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Title: Form and function – Brian Maye on architect and novelist James Franklin Fuller
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irish-diary/2024/12/02/form-and-function-brian-maye-on-architect-and-novelist-james-franklin-fuller/

Full Content:
James Franklin Fuller, who died 100 years ago on December 8th, could well be described as a renaissance man. A distinguished architect, he was also a successful novelist and published on history, archaeology, antiquarianism and genealogy. He was born near Derryquin, Co Kerry, in 1835 (date and month unknown) into a family of minor gentry; his father, Thomas, was a landowner, and his mother, Frances Bland, was of Derryquin Castle. Tutored by James Murphy, who later conducted the Crown case in the trial for the Phoenix Park murders, he then attended boarding school at Blackrock, Cork, where he befriended Thomas Newenham Deane, afterwards a well-known architect. Moving to England in 1850, he worked as an actor for a time and was a mechanical-engineering apprentice for a year before studying architecture in London and Manchester. In London, he contributed literary work to journals such as Truth, Dark Blue and Once a Week, and joined volunteer regiments while working in Manchester, Sheffield and London. In 1860, he married Helen Prospére, a descendant of one of Napoleon’s generals, and returned to Ireland. Appointed architect of the Irish Ecclesiastical Commissioners (a government Church of Ireland agency), he oversaw the building and renovation of churches all over Ireland. When the Church of Ireland was disestablished (1869), he used the compensation he received to set up practice in Dublin on Brunswick (now Pearse) Street. An early commission was the restoration of Annaghmore House, near Collooney, Co Sligo, which was carried out “in an unusually restrained classical style”, according to the Historic Houses of Ireland website. The Church of Ireland Representative Church Body had replaced the IEC and he was fortunate to be appointed its architect and continued to work for it for 40 years. Commissions for new churches followed as well as for important restoration work on cathedrals but he also received commissions for secular buildings such as Dalkey town hall, the maternity hospital at the Coombe and several schools in Dublin. Linde Lunney and Andrew O’Brien, who wrote the entry on him in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, described him as “the leading architect of country houses of his day” and list Kylemore Castle (Galway), Ashford Castle (Mayo) and Tinakilly House (Wicklow) as among his restorations, as well as Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and a member of the Royal Irish Academy. For his published fiction, Fuller used the pseudonym “Ignotus” and, occasionally, “An Old Boy”. In his three-volume novel, Culmshire Folk (1873), the Scotsman newspaper detected similarities to George Eliot’s work, which was quite a tribute. Lunney and O’Brien believed that “the strongest part of his writing was dialogue and character observation”. Other stories published by him were John Orlebar, Billy, or The Young Idea, Chronicles of Westerly and Doctor Quodlibet. An article in this newspaper by Gemma Tipton (October 22nd, 2015) described his fiction as “melodramatic”. He also published extensively in local history, antiquarianism and genealogy, in such periodicals as the Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, the Kerry Archaeological Magazine and the Genealogist, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland and of the Society of Antiquaries of London. His memoir, entitled Omniana: The Autobiography of an Irish Octogenarian, published in 1916, “is a rambling but engaging recollection of a varied life”, according to Lunney and O’Brien. In it “he gives some space to outlining his ancestry to prove his pretensions to the aristocracy, tracing his family back to Charlemagne – which turned out to be true”, The Irish Times article referred to above tells us. Curiously, there is little reference in Omniana to his architectural achievements but The Irish Times article just cited may have the explanation: “The things that mattered most to Fuller – pedigree, social connections, a ‘gentlemanly’ disdain for the necessity of working for a living (which perhaps accounts for his attitude to filing and the relative lack of any architectural musings or descriptions in his autobiography) – are ironically perhaps the most potent reasons why he is relatively forgotten today.” He died at his residence on Eglinton Road, Donnybrook and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. His wife, son and daughter survived him; three other children predeceased him. His wife died eight months after him and on their gravestone in Mount Jerome is carved: “Their spirits departed in peace with the viaticum of a conscience void of enmity of offence.” The actress Peggy Cummins was his great-granddaughter. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: Traditional finance, or TradFi, is commonly known as everyday finance. Decentralized finance, its fast-growing alternative, revolves around blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Given traders’ evolving needs, DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to bridge the gap between decentralized and traditional finance and offer the best experiences. This forward-thinking approach has been hailed as a trailblazer, which isn’t surprising. It will combine key elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering traders the best of both worlds—a new DeFi project to keep on the radar. DTX Exchange (DTX): What it is About DTX Exchange (DTX) is a new player gearing up to shake up the global trading sector and the crypto market. Unlike traditional platforms, it will employ blockchain technology and an asset tokenization model, offering a unique solution to challenges faced by traders and conventional trading platforms. By combining the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges, DTX will build the first hybrid trading platform, which is its unique offering. But that isn’t all. It aims to bridge the gap between the crypto world and the traditional financial system through a unified L1 blockchain, VulcanX. For the first time, users will be able to trade over 120,000 asset classes across stocks, bonds, ETFs, commodities and cryptos via a unified crypto wallet. Wallet-based trading, distributed liquidity pools, non-custodial storage and an intuitive user-friendly interface will be some of its distinguishing features. The above will make DTX a strong contender in the $10 billion global trading market, driving huge market demand. Experts listed it among the new DeFi projects worth investing in, positioning DTX Exchange as a must-have crypto. Key Solutions by the DTX Exchange Protocol Addressing challenges faced by the trading industry through various innovations is one of its biggest attractions. Let’s continue with how it aims to transform users’ trading experience. Enhanced Liquidity through Distributed Liquidity Pools: Low or poor liquidity is no doubt one of the pressing challenges within the sector. To address this, DTX will combine funds from various sources, allowing the platform to offer competitive and consistent prices to traders. Non-Custodial Storage for Improved Security: Centralization and the risk associated with centralized custody solutions have become critical issues in the trading scene. Its non-custodial model will give users full control of their private keys and assets—their private keys, their assets. Tokenization for Asset Classes Expansion: Its tokenized assets will represent real-world financial instruments, commodities and tangible assets. This model will represent traditional assets on the blockchain, allowing users to invest in the global trading market. Wallet-Based Trading and Financial Inclusion: The exchange protocol will embrace financial inclusion by allowing direct trading from crypto wallets without requiring traditional bank accounts. With users able to participate in global financial markets, it is set for adoption and is arguably the best crypto to invest in. New DeFi Coin With 100x Upside Potential As one of the fastest-growing new ICOs, its massive upside potential has captured whale and retail attention. Over $9 million has been raised in funding amid soaring demand, positioning it as this quarter’s best presale. In the sixth round of the ICO, a token costs only $0.12, which is not only cheaper than most top altcoins but also more promising. With its debut around the corner, a 100x gain is projected—perhaps the best new crypto to invest in.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Whether you're a gamer or know one yourself, Cyber Monday's gaming deals are worth checking out for upgrading your devices and curating gifts. However, we recommend you snag them fast since the best Cyber Monday gaming deals are likely going to expire after today. Gaming consoles, Switch accessories, and PC peripherals are all on sale for all-time low prices. The highly-coveted PS5 Digital Edition is $75 off. Meanwhile, you can save $50 on the Xbox Series X Digital Edition. PC gamers can also secure deep discounts on powerful gaming laptops, like this Dell system with an Intel Core i9 and RTX 4070 for $200 off. Find the best Cyber Monday gaming deals on products we recommend below. If you're gift shopping, check out our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals for sales across all categories, including home, kitchen, tech, and more. For Cyber Monday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle was available for $50 off, but that deal sold out. However, even at full price the bundle still saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and membership separately. This bundle includes a standard Nintendo Switch console, a download code for Mario Kart 8, and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch online. Even at full price, this package already saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and subscription separately. Highlights Inspired by Nintendo's popular Legend of Zelda franchise, this bundle includes a gold-colored Switch Lite console and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch Online. The typical combined price of both items would be $250, so this bundle saves you around $40. The 8BitDo Ultimate is comfortable, highly customizable, and comes with a convenient charging dock. The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch is a full-sized gamepad that offers bigger buttons, better joysticks, and extra customizable buttons. The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Cyber Monday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Walmart. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Cyber Monday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low of $374. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games. This model includes a disc drive and some free Fortnite content, like in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. You can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription for a total of $299. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Cyber Monday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This model of the X16 R2 by Asus has powerful specs to run almost any demanding game at high frames-per-second on its large 16-inch QHD 240Hz display. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Cyber Monday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful, and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: Intel’s Turnaround CEO Pat Gelsinger Steps Down, Ending a Long Tenure at the Chipmaker

Time Published: 2024-12-02T18:26:13Z

After nearly four years of attempting to turn around Intel’s struggling semiconductor business, Pat Gelsinger is out as the company’s CEO. His resignation ends a tenure marked by plunging profits and a failure to capitalize on the A.I. boom that lifted rivals like Nvidia. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” said Frank Yeary, a longtime Intel board member who will act as its interim executive chair in light of Gelsinger’s departure, in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Gelsinger, 63, stepped down as CEO and left Intel’s board effective yesterday (Dec. 1), the chipmaker announced today in a press release. David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, two senior Intel executives, will act as co-CEOs while the company’s board works to find a permanent successor. Zinsner is currently the company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of head of Intel Products and will oversee its client computing, data center and A.I., and network groups. Intel shares rose 4 percent today in response to the news. The resignation caps more than 30 years at Intel for Gelsinger, who first joined the company as a teenager in 1979 and went on to become its first chief technology officer at the turn of the century before leaving Intel in 2009. After taking a senior position at the tech company EMC and serving as the CEO of the cloud computing player VMware, Gelsinger in 2021 returned to Intel to take over from then-CEO Bob Swan. Despite ambitions to regain Intel’s leadership in the semiconductor industry, the company in recent years has failed to catch up with competitors and has seen its share price plunge by about 50 percent in 2024 alone. At the center of Gelsinger’s turnaround plan was a strategy to branch into contract manufacturing to compete with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major supplier to U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and Qualcomm. In the meantime, the company has also pivoted to making A.I. accelerators to compete with industry leaders like Nvidia, but with little success—Intel’s current market cap is only 3 percent of Nvidia’s. Intel is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which is awarding the company nearly $7.9 billion in federal grants to expand its domestic manufacturing network—about a quarter of Intel’s cost of goods sold in 2023. Gelsinger’s ousting also came amid rumblings of activist investor interest in Intel. The company, which in October reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, reportedly tapped advisors like Morgan Stanley (MS) earlier this year to defend itself from activist pressure. “Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,” said Gelsinger in a statement. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The tech-driven Nasdaq reached a high on Monday, driven by gains by Intel and Tesla (TSLA+0.13%), getting December off to a good start after a November that was the best month of 2024 for both the Dow and S&P 500. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.27% and the Nasdaq climbed 1%. This week, investors will see a diverse range of earnings reports from tech, meme stock, and entertainment companies. Salesforce (CRM+8.39% is set to release its earnings report Tuesday after the market closes. GameStop (GME+0.36%), a popular meme stock, will also report earnings Wednesday, and Lululemon (LULU+0.38%), which has been facing challenges due to sluggish sales, will report its earnings Thursday after the closing bell. In addition, the November jobs report will be released later this week. Shares of Intel (INTC-2.11% jumped 5% as the company announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chip-maker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors such as Nvidia (NVDA+2.17%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. Tesla shares rose 3% after Roth MKM upgraded the stock from “Neutral” to “Buy,” setting a price target of $380 (up from $85). The firm cited the potential impact of CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump as a catalyst for the upgrade, suggesting it could bolster Tesla’s prospects in the coming months. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+3.58%) soared 23% on Monday morning following the announcement that an independent special committee had concluded its investigation into the company’s operations and found no evidence of misconduct by the company’s management or board of directors. –Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: gmast3r / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 116 Deutsche Bank recently increased its price target for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) after conducting research around the company’s Agentforce product. “Partners we spoke with noted strong momentum in Data Cloud, particularly with multi-cloud customers, along with high interest in Einstein 1 for Sales and Service clouds. Finance and Healthcare sectors were also mentioned as positives within industry clouds,” analyst Brad Zelnick wrote in a note. He raised his price target for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) to $365 from $325 and maintained his Buy rating. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “In the third quarter, we purchased new positions in Apple and Oracle and eliminated our small positions in Nike and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). We exited our position in Salesforce to fund better opportunities in Shopify and MSCI. Salesforce is seeing slower revenue growth than we would have expected, given the weakening macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, since its core end markets in customer relationship management (“CRM”) and Service are fairly mature, a lower growth level versus our expectations could persist for some time.” Overall, CRM ranks 6th on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Morgan Stanley Analyst Says Meta Platforms (META) ‘Farthest Along’ in AI Monetization

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in December. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in December. Jared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via “diplomacy.” “If you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn’t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can’t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the ‘not in my backyard’ issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There’s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.” Answering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge. “We’re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That’s not enough, that’s not enough time. So, you know, the US is going to continue to lead in the space, but it’s not going to be able to lead on its own.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are getting investors’ attention on the back of latest news.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Bloomua / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Brian Nowak, head of U.S. internet research at Morgan Stanley, while talking to CNBC in a latest program explained how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is using AI for monetization of its huge user base and said the company is “farthest along” in AI monetization. “Meta continues to be the company showing the most early signals on how to monetize generative AI and GPU-enabled machine learning. They are building better models to analyze all of their data more effectively. As they analyze more data, time spent per user is growing off already large numbers. You already have 30 to 40 minutes per user per day across Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms, and that time is growing. On top of that, the way they monetize this time through more relevant ads—ads with higher click-through rates that actually drive more transactions—is also improving. So, when we think about this early generative AI cycle, Meta continues to be the company farthest along in building new models to better analyze its leading first-party data, drive more engagement, and monetize that engagement more effectively.” Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.” Overall, MU ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in December. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Republican AGs File Suit Against Asset Managers Alleging Coal Repression Scheme
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/republican-ags-file-suit-against-asset-managers-alleging-coal-repression-scheme/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T17:47:14Z
Full Content:
Eleven states filed a complaint against BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and the Vanguard Group Inc. for allegedly both working to constrict coal markets through anti-competitive practices and misleading investors in funds that do not take environment, social and governance factors into consideration. Attorney generals from the 11 states filed the complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, on Wednesday, with lead representation from the Buzbee Law Firm, based in Austin, Texas. The states allege that the asset managers took “substantial” holdings in U.S. coal companies, which they leveraged to press the companies to focus on green energy goals, such as reducing coal output by more than half by 2030. The plaintiffs also claim that the asset managers used positions in organizations such as the Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative to signal their work to reduce coal output, which the plaintiffs allege led to cost increases for coal-powered electricity. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  “For the past four years, America’s coal producers have been responding not to the price signals of the free market, but to the commands of Larry Fink, BlackRock’s Chairman and CEO, and his fellow asset managers,” the complaint states in its opening. “As demand for the electricity Americans need to heat their homes and power their businesses has gone up, the supply of the coal used to generate that electricity has been artificially depressed—and the price has skyrocketed.” The lawsuit is led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and includes the attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. The plaintiffs are seeking billions in damages, according to a press release by the Buzbee law firm. In the complaint, the attorney generals also call on the asset managers to divest their investments in coal company stock and for the firms to be restrained from any further “deceptive, or misleading acts or practices” related to the positioning of funds. BlackRock said via emailed statement that its holdings in energy companies are regularly reviewed by regulators and that “we make these investments on behalf of our clients, and our focus is on delivering them financial returns. The suggestion that BlackRock has invested money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense. This lawsuit undermines Texas’ pro-business reputation and discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on.” State Street wrote in a statement that the firm “acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value. As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies. This lawsuit is baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard did not respond to request for comment. Per the complaint, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street held $108.787 billion, $101.119 billion and $35.736 billion in coal investments, respectively, as of February 15, 2022. Clayton Act For its key argument, the complaint cites Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which prohibits the acquisition of stock when “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition.” By having substantial holdings in coal companies, the complaint alleges that the asset managers “acquired the power to influence the policies of these competing companies and bring about a substantial lessening of competition in the markets for coal.” According to the attorneys general, as publicly traded coal companies have reduced output, smaller, private companies have increased production. Those firms, according to the complaint, struggle to meet the demand and cannot get the financing and loans to needed to increase capacity. The complaint details the companies in question, such as Peabody Energy, NACCO Industries and Warrior Met Coal, and the percent of shares held by the asset managers: 30.43%, 10.85% and 31.62%, respectively, as of June 30. The plaintiffs refer extensively to public comments by high-level executives at the asset managers, including Fink, regarding the promotion of efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase the market share of the clean energy industry. The complaint also notes stock voting positions the firms took that allegedly supported reductions in output and divulges information regarding climate disclosures. Clean Energy Initiatives The complaint refers to all three firms joining the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative, intended to reduce the CO2 emissions from coal more than 58% between 2020 and 2030. Vanguard withdrew from that initiative in 2022. In addition, the complaint notes that BlackRock and State Street joined the Climate Action 100+, an organization whose stated goal is to reduce coal output by more than half by 2030. BlackRock and State Street eventually withdrew from the Climate Action 100+; Vanguard never joined it. Climate Action 100+ has more than 600 signatories, representing more than $68 trillion in assets under management. The Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative represents more than 325 signatories with $57.5 trillion in AUM. In the complaint, the attorneys general also argue that BlackRock, in particular, misled investors who were seeking to invest in ”non-ESG” funds by using those holdings to advance its climate goals. “In addition to joining with the other two major institutional asset managers to bring about a reduction in the output of coal, Defendant BlackRock went further—actively deceiving investors about the nature of its funds,” the complaint states. “Rather than inform investors that it would use their shareholdings to advance climate goals, BlackRock consistently and uniformly represented its non-ESG funds would be dedicated solely to enhancing shareholder value.” Last year, 26 attorneys general filed a lawsuit seeking to overthrow the Department of Labor’s final rule permitting ESG factors to be used when selecting retirement plan investments. That lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Northern Texas but is currently under appeal to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Title: Luxury real estate brokers in DC are gearing up for a flurry of big-dollar sales as power players flock to town for Trump’s return

As Washington braces for Donald Trump’s return to the White House next month, one sector is already counting its blessings: the District’s high-end real estate market. With billionaires and power players expected to flood the nation’s capital, brokers are gearing up for a flurry of multimillion-dollar deals in elite neighborhoods like Kalorama and Massachusetts Heights. “I think we will see some big numbers transact again starting around January,” Michael Rankin, principal at Sotheby’s International Realty in DC told Curbed. These big spenders, he added, have been waiting for clarity before splashing out on properties. “People don’t want to spend $5, $10, $15 million if they don’t know whether they’ll be confirmed or not. But what we do know of the people who are coming is that it’s the multimillionaire and multibillionaire class.” Trump’s first term saw a buying spree from his inner circle. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dropped $12 million on a Beaux-Arts mansion, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin shelled out $12.58 million for a 16,000-square-foot estate and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson snagged a $5.5 million Kalorama home. This time around, brokers are already fielding inquiries from high-profile officials, although NDAs keep the details tightly under wraps. Kalorama, known for its palatial homes and diplomatic residents, is likely to see the bulk of activity. “It’s a more palatial atmosphere in Kalorama compared to Georgetown,” Washington hostess Sally Quinn once told Esquire during Trump’s first term as president. “Bigger, newer houses.” That said, Georgetown, with its liberal reputation, is unlikely to host many members of Trump’s team. “I have not heard of any of the Trump people living in Georgetown,” Quinn added. But not all the buzz is positive. Trump’s plans to cut the federal workforce could send shockwaves through the middle and upper-middle-class housing market, with agencies like HHS and EPA bracing for layoffs. “My team has had a number of calls from people at agencies… saying, ‘We don’t know what’s going on, but we might need to sell,’” Eva Davis, an executive vice president at Compass, told Curbed. There’s also concern that Trump’s team may not be as invested in DC as past administrations, given his penchant for Florida and New York. “I think this administration doesn’t spend as much time in the District as other administrations,” one broker added. Even Elon Musk, one of Trump’s wealthiest allies, seems unlikely to make a splash in the local market. “He isn’t a big house person,” Rankin said. Advertisement

Title: Intel stock climbs over 4% after Pat Gelsinger's retirement

Intel (INTC-2.11%) shares climbed by over 4% during mid-day trading on Monday after the company announced that its chief executive is out. After over four decades at the chip pioneer, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger retired from the company and stepped down from its board of directors on Sunday, Intel said. Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner and chief executive of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus will now serve as interim co-CEOs while Intel’s board looks for another leader. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board, will become its interim executive chair. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. Intel’s shares, which have fallen over 47% so far this year, were up by about 4.4% amid the news, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+1.24%) U.S.-listed shares were up by almost 5%, and British chip designer Arm’s (ARM+1.19%) shares were up by 4.5%. Gelsinger’s stepping down comes as the chipmaker loses ground to competitors including Nvidia (NVDA+2.17%), which has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom. In late November, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized Intel’s Chips Act funding of up to $7.86 billion — less than the proposed $8.5 billion announced in March. However, the finalized direct funding is in addition to a $3 billion contract Intel was awarded under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave. The program is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. With its Chips Act funding, Intel plans to expand its U.S. semiconductor industry footprint with chipmaking and advanced packaging sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon — an investment worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November and replaced by Nvidia. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

While there are some great deals on the brand’s latest gear from other retailers, its website features loads of deep deals as well with huge discounts, freebies, elevated trade-in offers, and more. Samsung’s official Black Friday landing page is now populated with a bunch of fresh Cyber Monday offers, and you can check out the details below to find the best deals. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped.

OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year.

Title: Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger pushed out following tumultuous tenure leading the chip giant

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired effective Dec. 1 and stepped down from the company's board of directors. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. Intel stock was up roughly 5% on the news midday before reversing direction. Shares fell as much as 2% in afternoon trading. A person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance that the board had lost confidence in Gelsinger and a change was needed ahead of 2025. The person added the decision was made by a small group of people inside Intel, and the leadership team was only made aware Sunday afternoon. It's unclear if Intel will continue with Gelsinger's expensive expansion into making chips for other companies, the source said. Intel has named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. The company said its board has formed a search committee and “will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.” “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Intel's board chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Intel is facing two separate lawsuits filed this year by investors claiming they were misled about the company's financial performance. The latest was filed by a pension fund in August following the chipmaker's announcement that it would slash 15,000 jobs. Gelsinger had previously spent 30 years at Intel but left in 2009. He rejoined the company in 2021, taking over the role of chief executive from Bob Swan. Gelsinger promised that his tenure would bring back a “Grovian” mindset to the company and right years of missteps that saw Intel lose its edge in the chip market to artificial intelligence chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA) and chip manufacturing giant TSMC (TSM). That goal referred to former CEO Andy Grove, who oversaw a spectacular turnaround for the company in the 1980s when Intel struggled to maintain its dominance in the memory chip market amid competition from Japan — and made a dramatic shift toward producing another kind of chip, called CPUs, of which it became the leading manufacturer. Many of the problems facing Intel predate Gelsinger's tenure and will remain a challenge for its next leadership group. Intel is grappling with a slump in PC chip sales that’s only just beginning to improve and increased competition in that market from AMD (AMD) and British chip designer Arm (ARM), all while the CPU market as a whole is threatened by the rise of GPU chips, which are used to run generative artificial intelligence — a market dominated by Nvidia. As Intel CEO, Gelsinger sought to bolster the company's foundry business by making chips for external customers. Intel makes its own chips but had never produced semiconductors for external customers, and its own chipmaking processes faced delays beginning in the mid-2010s. Gelsinger undertook aggressive efforts to improve Intel's manufacturing processes — which he outlined at the start of his time as CEO in 2021 — that aimed to reverse the foundry's former failures in five years. Intel has recently focused on upgrading to a manufacturing process called 18A that would allow it to directly compete with TSMC as a producer of AI chips. Gelsinger's departure casts doubt on the company's focus on its service foundry, which could affect Intel's ability to catch up in the AI space, according to analysts. "[W]hile keeping [the foundries] feels like deadweight (and a continuation of the strategy that got Pat out), scrapping them would also be fraught with difficulties around the product roadmap, outsourcing strategy, CHIPS act, and political navigation," Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note Monday. In late November, Intel was officially awarded $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding for its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The company also recently announced plans to split its foundry business into an independent subsidiary, and Gelsinger's exit could accelerate that change, according to Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri. The move toward Intel's money-losing chip manufacturing business has so far failed to bolster faith in the company. Intel has recently become a takeover target, and shares of the company are down more than 50% for the year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 26%. Intel stock was recently replaced by Nvidia in the Dow. As Bernstein's Rasgon wrote, "There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride."

Manage your account Intel (INTC) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers.

(Reuters) -Intel has started evaluating a handful of outsiders, including former board member Lip-Bu Tan, for the role of chief executive after the struggling American chipmaking icon ousted company veteran Pat Gelsinger, according to people familiar with the matter. Tan, a well-respected semiconductor industry veteran who has long been seen as a contender for CEO at Intel, has been approached by Intel's board in recent days to gauge his interest in taking up the job, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. Intel's board is mostly evaluating outsider candidates for the role and has also approached Marvell Technology CEO Matt Murphy, two of the sources said.

Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said earlier on Wednesday that annual inflation - currently running at nearly 9% - had not started to slow yet. "It is also necessary to curb inflation, which is currently at a fairly high level," Putin told an international investment conference organised by Russia's second-largest lender VTB in Moscow. Chinese chip companies targeted by Washington with fresh export controls have vowed to speed up supply chain localisation and said they would be able to continue production thanks to recent efforts to build equipment stockpiles.

In the Chinese futures market, agricultural product futures play a crucial role. While previous studies have primarily relied on historical price data and fundamental financial indicators of agricultural product futures, there is a growing recognition of the value that lies within the vast amounts of textual data generated in the financial domain. Our study specifically focuses on the limitations of existing methods in capturing the complex relationships and rich semantic information embedded in these textual sources. This article designs a CIMA AttGRU (CIMA-AttGRU) model for soybean futures, which is a forecasting method for the agricultural product market. This model uniquely integrates Collective Intrinsic Mode Analysis (CIMA) with an Attention-Gated Recurrent Unit (AttGRU), leveraging the strengths of both techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability. The rationale behind employing the CIMA-AttGRU model lies in its ability to effectively tackle the inherent challenges of financial market analysis. By incorporating CIMA, the model adeptly filters out market noise, directly addressing the challenge of high volatility. Additionally, with its attention mechanism, the CIMA-AttGRU targets the issue of non-linear patterns by allowing dynamic adjustment to temporal dependencies, offering differential learning capabilities crucial for capturing the nuanced fluctuations in futures prices. Complementing the CIMA and AttGRU, the integration of Class-wise Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA) further refines the model’s robustness, addressing the critical challenge of domain adaptivity. This aspect is particularly vital for edamame futures, where price determinants can vary significantly over time and across regions. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement in forecasting precision, with the CIMA-AttGRU model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 15% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of 20% compared to conventional models. This superior performance, especially in terms of prediction accuracy and handling market fluctuations, highlights the improve of the model compared to existing methods and has made significant explorations in agricultural market forecasting.

In the diverse landscape of China’s futures market, agricultural product futures occupy a pivotal position, reflecting their significant influence on both the economy and food security [1]. Among these products, edamame stands out due to its unique position in the market and its broader implications on economic trends [2]. Traditionally, stock market analysis has relied heavily on quantitative financial data. However, the increasing availability of textual data, such as earnings call transcripts, financial news, and social media discussions, presents an untapped opportunity to enhance market prediction accuracy. This study explores the integration of natural language processing techniques with financial data analysis to leverage the semantic content of textual data for improved stock price volatility forecasting. Considering the close relationship between the prices of edamame futures and their spot market values, we posit that accurate forecasting of edamame futures prices is a critical yet challenging endeavor, amplified by the commodity’s unique market dynamics. This correlation implies that fluctuations in the spot market can have immediate and significant impacts on futures prices, necessitating a nuanced approach to prediction. The futures market, characterized by its nonlinear trends and volatile patterns, demands advanced forecasting methods. In this regard, the advent of deep learning has marked a significant advancement. Deep learning, especially models designed for nonlinear time series prediction, offers robust tools for deciphering the complex patterns inherent in futures prices [3]. However, traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [4] encounter challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients, particularly with extended time series data. This limitation highlights the necessity for innovative deep learning approaches, perhaps incorporating techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [5] or attention mechanisms [6], which are better equipped to manage the complexities of long-term futures price prediction and could provide more accurate and reliable forecasts for stakeholders in the edamame market. To address the limitations of traditional RNNs, LSTM units were developed, which enhance RNNs with gate units and an additional input variable to combat the vanishing gradient problem. While LSTMs alleviate the short-term memory limitations of RNNs, their complex structure of four fully connected layers can result in increased training times and a higher parameter count. In response, Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) [7] were proposed as an evolution of LSTM. GRUs streamline the architecture by combining the hidden layer and cell state and reducing the number of gate units to two. Empirical studies have demonstrated that GRUs can outperform RNNs and LSTMs in terms of parameter update speed and training efficiency, achieving similar predictive results with greater efficiency. However, both LSTM and GRU models, despite their advancements over RNNs, face challenges in capturing complex relationships in extended data series. They often struggle to extract pivotal internal correlations and identify significant feature combinations for accurate prediction. To overcome this, we introduce the AttGRU model, which incorporates an Attention mechanism within the GRU framework. This integration enables the AttGRU to focus more effectively on relevant features and internal correlations, thereby enhancing its learning capabilities from historical data. Despite these improvements, handling random noise in historical data remains a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, we employ CIMA for its efficacy in noise reduction. The proposed hybrid CIMA-AttGRU prediction model combines the noise-filtering capabilities for CIMA with the advanced feature extraction and focus of AttGRU. This synergistic approach allows for more nuanced and accurate predictions in the futures market, addressing both the intricacies of the data and the inherent noise, and setting a new benchmark in futures price forecasting. Furthermore, we tackle the challenge of data migration in time series analysis, a common occurrence in futures markets where changes over time can lead to domain shifts. Domain shifts refer to the scenario where the statistical properties of the data change, which can significantly impact the accuracy of predictive models. To address this, we introduce the CADA algorithm. CADA enhances the robustness of the feature extractor against these domain variances. It operates by aligning the current training data more closely with future data projections, ensuring that the model remains effective even as the underlying data evolves over time. The model’s efficacy is rigorously benchmarked against 13 comparative models, using metrics such as MAE [8], Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [9], and the coefficient of determination (R2) [10]. The empirical findings underscore CIMA- AttGRU’s superiority in prediction accuracy. These results highlight its effectiveness in accurately capturing the complex dynamics of the edamame futures market. For market stakeholders, the CIMA-AttGRU model presents a more robust tool for navigating market volatility, enabling more precise risk management, and facilitating informed decision- making. The principal contributions of this study are manifold: Time series forecasting, a critical component across various domains such as meteorology, finance, energy, and healthcare, has seen significant advancements with the adoption of deep learning, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning. The Transformer architecture, initially designed for natural language processing, has been adapted to capture long-range dependencies in time series data [11], with studies exploring its effectiveness and efficiency [12, 13]. Probabilistic models like Bayesian time series and Gaussian Processes offer insights into the uncertainty of future observations, with recent innovations integrating deep learning to enhance forecasting capabilities [14]. The exploration of reinforcement learning for dynamic model adjustment [15] and meta-learning for few-shot learning scenarios [16] represent novel directions aiming at adaptability and generalization. Hybrid models combine traditional statistical methods with machine learning to capture both linear and non-linear patterns, demonstrating the synergy between ARIMA and neural networks, as well as the potential of deep learning architectures in ensemble models for improved accuracy [17]. Specific domain applications highlight the impact of advanced forecasting models in finance for predicting market trends [18], in energy for renewable energy management and load forecasting [19], and in healthcare for predicting disease outbreaks and patient admissions [20]. This evolving field continues to explore the intersection of diverse methodologies, reflecting the complex nature of time series data and the need for innovative forecasting models. Transitioning to a different approach, Yao et al.’s investigation into egg price forecasting using AutoRegressive (AR) models offers a contrasting perspective [21]. Yao et al.’s research highlights the significant influence of external factors, such as market policies and environmental changes, on futures prices. This finding underscores the necessity of considering such variables in predictive analyses to capture the full spectrum of influences affecting commodity prices. The application of RNNs in processing time series data, as demonstrated in Huang and Yu’s stock index predictions, has shown significant ad- vantages due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies. However, RNNs face challenges like the ‘vanishing gradient’ and ‘exploding gradient’ problems, which impede their effectiveness, especially with long-term data dependencies. Addressing these issues, Ouyang et al. proposed the Short-term Time Series Network (LSTNet), which effectively circumvents these limitations and outperforms both ARIMA and traditional RNNs models in agricultural product futures price prediction [22]. Wang and Gao’s research further asserts the superiority of LSTM models in time series pre- diction, despite challenges in training stability. Similarly, Huang and Yong successfully used Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) alongside LSTM for crude oil price prediction, emphasizing the critical role of optimal hyperparameter tuning [23]. Amalia et al. compared LSTM and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models in agricultural product price prediction, finding that GRUs offer advantages in terms of speed and accuracy [24]. Peng et al. introduced an innovative CNN-GRU-Attention combination model for water source quality forecasting. This model leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), GRU, and Attention mechanisms, demonstrating its superiority over other techniques in capturing complex patterns [25]. Finally, Yang et al. combined GRU and Attention mechanisms for individual stock predictions, showcasing the efficacy of integrating these advanced models to improve predictive accuracy [26]. The advancement of machine learning models in the domain of financial market analysis has seen significant contributions from various baseline models, each offering unique insights into time series forecasting and domain adaptation. Notably, models like LSTM [27] and GRU [28] have been instrumental in capturing temporal dependencies in market trends, while SVR [29] has provided robust solutions for nonlinear pattern recognition in price fluctuations. Additionally, attention-based models such as AttGRU [30], alongside innovative architectures like RainDrop [31] and SimTSC [32], have enhanced model sensitivity to crucial time series features. The LB-SimTSC [33] and TodayNet [34] further exemplify the integration of domain adaptation strategies, improving model robust- ness across different market conditions. Complex models incorporating multiple attention mechanisms, such as Attention-GRU [35], Attention-LSTM [36], and Attention-AttGRU [37], represent the forefront of leveraging deep learning to understand and predict agricultural market dynamics effectively. These models collectively contribute to the foundation upon which our study builds, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability in forecasting edamame futures prices. The evolution of deep neural networks (DNNs) has significantly impacted domain adaptation (DA), a process critical in applications such as cross-domain image classification and person re-identification. This process involves modifying models to perform accurately across varying domains. Tzeng et al. have advanced this field by integrating adaptation layers into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which facilitate the extraction of domain- invariant features, essential for models to perform consistently across different domains [38]. Furthering this development, Long et al. combined Joint Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JMMD) with CNNs, a method that reduces disparities between different domain distributions, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to generalize across domains [39]. Deng et al. introduced an innovative approach, Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT), which marks a significant contribution to DA by aligning data clusters in a teacher-student model framework, enhancing the model’s adaptability to new domains [40]. Our research is inspired by the adversarial learning-based DA, particularly Ganin et al.’s Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN). DANN employs an adversarial approach to train models to be domain-agnostic, thereby improving their performance across different domains [41]. This concept was further expanded by Long et al., who developed conditional domain adversarial networks. These networks refine the adversarial approach by conditioning the training process on domain-specific information, leading to more effective domain adaptation [42]. The cornerstone of our research lies in the development and application of the CIMA- AttGRU model, a pioneering approach designed to address the intricate dynamics of agricultural market trends, particularly in the context of edamame futures prices. This innovation is primarily motivated by the unique challenges posed by agricultural production’s pronounced seasonality and cyclicity. Recognizing the critical influence of these factors on price volatility and trend predictability, we incorporated Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) as a strategic component of our model. EMD’s ability to decompose non-stationary and non-linear time series data into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) enables the effective separation of underlying cyclical patterns from noise, thereby facilitating a more nuanced analysis of seasonal and cyclic components inherent in agricultural data. This methodological choice is underpinned by the agricultural sector’s inherent characteristics, where production cycles are significantly influenced by seasonal variations and external climatic conditions. By applying EMD, our model gains the capacity to dissect these complex datasets into simpler oscillatory modes, each representing distinct frequency bands. This decomposition allows for the isolation and examination of seasonal effects and cyclical trends, which are pivotal for understanding and forecasting the edamame futures market’s behavior. The integration of EMD within the CIMA-AttGRU framework significantly enhances the model’s predictive performance. It does so by providing a robust mechanism for capturing and analyzing the temporal dependencies and patterns that traditional models might overlook. Furthermore, this approach empowers our model to offer insightful forecasts that are critically informed by an in-depth understanding of the agricultural market’s seasonal and cyclical dynamics, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in financial market analysis. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a specialized subset of RNNs, is characterized by its modular neural architecture, which is specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of information processing. To provide a clearer understanding of this intricate architecture, the GRU model’s design and operational flow are depicted in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g001 The CIMA methodology [43], which is primarily utilized for decomposing historical data into its intrinsic modes, faces inherent challenges when integrating new data sets. CIMA, known for its effectiveness in breaking down complex data into simpler components, encounters difficulties as the introduction of new data can significantly alter the results of its decomposition process. This change necessitates reprocessing by the trained model to accommodate the new information and ensure accurate decomposition. A critical aspect of this reprocessing is the increase in the number of components that the model needs to analyze and interpret. Each new data set potentially introduces additional modes or variations, thereby increasing the complexity of the decomposition. This escalation in the number of components directly correlates with an increase in processing time. Such an increase is a significant concern in time-sensitive applications, where rapid analysis and decision-making based on the latest data are crucial. The challenge, therefore, lies in balancing the accuracy and thoroughness of the CIMA methodology with the need for efficiency and speed in processing and updating the model with new data inputs. To address these challenges and optimize training efficiency, the concept of Aggregate Binary Crossings (ABC) is introduced. This measure is calculated as per the following equation: (1) The function sgn(p) is defined as: (2) ABC essentially quantifies the frequency of sign changes within each component of the data, thus serving as an indicator of data fluctuation. This metric is particularly pertinent in the context of edamame futures data. As per the documented findings in previous research. An analysis of the ABC values reveals distinct frequency characteristics across different components which is showed in Table 1. For instance, IMF1, identified as a high-frequency component, exhibits an ABC exceeding 40%. Conversely, IMF2 through IMF3 are categorized as medium-frequency components with ABC values ranging between 10% and 40%. Components IMF4 to IMF10, classified as low-frequency, have ABCs below 10% [44]. The reconstruction of these components is depicted in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t001 This approach of using ABC for component analysis not only enhances the efficiency of the CIMA methodology in processing time series data but also provides a nuanced understanding of the data’s fluctuation characteristics, crucial for accurate forecasting in financial markets like edamame futures. The Attention Gate Unit (AttGRU) architecture depicted in Fig 3 represents a significant advancement in neural network design, particularly in how it computes candidate hidden states. This modification enables the AttGRU to process sequential data with enhanced capabilities, as it integrates an Attention mechanism that selectively focuses on specific parts of the input sequence. This allows the model to capture dependencies and nuances that might be overlooked by traditional GRU frameworks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g003 In the advanced architecture of the Attention-based Gated Recurrent Unit (AttGRU), the dynamic interaction between the memory cell and input values plays a pivotal role. This sophisticated mechanism is articulated through two primary gates which integrate the output value from the preceding timestep, ms−1, and the contemporaneous input, ys, orchestrating the degree to which previous cognitive states are retained or discarded. This process is mathematically encapsulated as follows: (3) In this formulation, σ and φ denote the Sigmoid and Leaky ReLU activation functions, respectively. The dual-stage nature of this gate, involving and their corresponding bias terms . The algorithm for the synthetic update gate is represented as: (4) Here, the dual-stage mechanism of the update gate, employing matrices ˘ and biases , echoes the approach of the reset gate, ensuring a delicate balance between preservation and evolution of the memory state. AttGRU is formulated as: (5) In this expression, Vβ represents the weight matrix associated with the attention mechanism. The attention probabilities, Ps, are derived through the softmax function applied to the scale βs: (6) The final phase of the AttGRU’s operation involves the calculation of the candidate hidden state. The resulting combination is then weighted and summed, with the attention probability distribution, Ps, playing a crucial role. The output gate of AttGRU is delineated as follows: (7) This advanced framework, characterized by its dual-stage gates and attention-driven dynamics, embodies a significant stride in the evolution of recurrent neural network architectures, offering enhanced capabilities for processing sequential data with refined contextual awareness. In this study, we outline the comprehensive architecture of the CIMA-AttGRU model, as illustrated in Fig 4. Our research specifically focuses on analyzing edamame futures price data, a choice driven by the significant economic impact and market volatility associated with this commodity. The CIMA-AttGRU model, designed to handle the complexities of this data, is methodically segmented into six distinct components to optimize its analytical efficacy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g004 The inaugural segment of our model is the input layer, where we introduce the primary dataset—edamame futures prices. This layer is crucial as it sets the foundation for the model’s data processing. In addition to the primary focus, we incorporate key financial indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) (Fig 5), SP 500 (Fig 6), and NASDAQ (Fig 7).

Their inclusion in the input layer allows the model to contextualize the edamame price data within a broader economic landscape, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of our analysis. Fig 4 visually presents the CIMA-AttGRU model’s architecture, showcasing how each component, from the input layer to the final output, contributes to the processing and analysis of the data. This visualization is instrumental in understanding the intricate workings of the model and how it integrates various elements to provide a comprehensive analysis of edamame futures prices. The CIMA-AttGRU model’s architecture, as delineated in our study, consists of several layers, each meticulously designed to contribute to the model’s overall predictive analysis. The second tier, the data preprocessing layer, is where the raw input data is refined and prepared for analysis. This includes normalization, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features, all of which are essential for enhancing the accuracy of the predictions. The third layer is dedicated to CIMA decomposition, where the data is broken down into IMFs. These IMFs represent different frequency components in the data, and their separation is crucial for isolating distinct patterns and trends. In this phase, the AttGRU mechanism is employed to forecast each component independently, allowing for a nuanced analysis of the various elements within the dataset. Following this, the fifth layer–the combination layer–plays a vital role in bringing together the individual forecasts from each IMF. This consolidation is key to synthesizing the data into a unified analysis, ensuring that all relevant information is factored into the final prediction. The process culminates in the output layer, the final stage of the model. Here, the aggregated results from the previous layers are scaled to produce the final predictive output. This output embodies the comprehensive prediction derived from the intricate processes of the CIMA-AttGRU model, offering a well-rounded analysis based on the data. In time series analysis, there is a challenge of data migration which is a common occurrence in futures markets where changes over time can lead to domain shifts. To address this, we introduce the CADA algorithm. Within the framework of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) training, initially conceptualized by Ganin and Lempitsky, a pivotal element is the incorporation of the marginal adversarial loss LT [41]. This loss function plays a crucial role in enabling the extraction of domain-invariant feature representations from both the source and target domains. It achieves this through adversarial learning, a process where the model is trained to minimize domain discrepancies, effectively harmonizing the marginal distributions of these domains. However, the conventional DANN model primarily focuses on aligning these domains at the level of their marginal distributions. While this approach has its merits, it can overlook the discriminative structures within the feature space. Such oversight may lead to negative transfer phenomena, where the model inadvertently adopts irrelevant or misleading features from the source domain. Our research draws upon established matrix optimization-based domain adaptation (DA) techniques to form the foundation of our proposed method. This approach is centered around the estimation of conditional distribution divergences. Specifically, it involves a detailed analysis of the variances in class conditional distributions. The subsequent sections will delve into a more comprehensive discussion on how these estimations are carried out and the implications thereof for the field of domain adaptation. In the realm of domain adaptation (DA) strategies for DNNs, which are steered by matrix optimization, the task of accurately estimating the equation outlined in Eq 9 is a formidable challenge. This equation integrates both genuine and synthetic labels, and its precise estimation is often complicated by the complexities inherent in batch sampling. These complexities chiefly stem from a potential misalignment between instances in the source and target domains. Such misalignment can skew the accuracy of estimating class-conditional distributions. Addressing this challenge, our approach introduces a selective mechanism for class subset sampling. This mechanism operates on a principle of alignment congruence; it calculates distribution distances only in instances where there is a match in label spaces between source and target domains during batch sampling. This strategic sampling approach is essential in accurately computing the loss function, which is a critical component of dependent adversarial domain adaptation. It significantly contributes to the model’s robustness and enhances its performance across varied and intricate data environments. The proposed framework, as articulated in Eq 9, involves a nuanced understanding of data instances, denoted as ZU/S,F, representing the Fth class from either source or target domain. Additionally, OF symbolizes the discriminator assigned to the Fth class. A notable aspect of this framework is the incorporation of pseudo labels from the target domain in each iteration, an approach that significantly augments the model’s precision and adaptability. To address the predictive loss aspect, we introduce a loss function specifically designed for evaluating the accuracy of time series forecasts in agricultural market trends. The predictive loss LP is formulated as follows: (10) where N is the number of forecasted points, yi represents the actual value at time i, and denotes the forecasted value. This loss function, rooted in the MSE, quantifies the deviation of the model’s predictions from the actual market outcomes, thereby guiding the optimization process towards more accurate forecasts. Incorporating LP into our domain adaptation framework, the overall objective be- comes the minimization of both domain adaptation loss and predictive loss. This dual- objective approach ensures that our model not only learns domain-invariant features but also hones its forecasting accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for predicting agricultural market trends with high precision and reliability. In conclusion, our CADA method extends the conventional DANN framework by incorporating a predictive loss component. This integration enhances the model’s capability to adapt across domains while simultaneously improving its forecasting accuracy, offering a robust solution for domain adaptation challenges in the context of agricultural market trend forecasting. The study was conducted using a computational setup comprised of a Windows 10 operating system. The hardware included an Intel(R) Core (TM) i7 CPU, an NVIDIA GTX4090 graphics card, and 24.00 GB of RAM. For software, Python 3.9 served as the programming language, with PyCharm utilized as the development environment. Data for this analysis was sourced from the Tushare platform, an open-access repository for financial big data. The study focused on key financial indices, U.S. Dollar Index (USDX), and NASDAQ. To assess the interrelations among these indices, the Maximum Information Coefficient (MaxIC) was employed in Table 2. This MaxIC is particularly adept at handling nonlinear data relationships. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t002 For a pair of variables (A, B), the methodology involves partitioning them into p and q intervals along their respective axes, thereby creating a grid of pq cells. Given a dataset of these two-dimensional variables, the MaxIC is computed as follows: (11) In this formula, MaxICMaxIC(A,B) signifies the maximum information coefficient for the variables (A, B). The term MaxInfo*(Dataset,p,q) represents the maximum mutual information obtainable from the dataset for the given partitioning. The SampleSize denotes the total number of data points, with Func(SampleSize) being a function of this size, typically set to SampleSize0.6 [45]. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using a dataset encompassing the edamame futures trading activities on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. The dataset is comprised of a total of 2750 entries. These entries were strategically segmented into different subsets for the purpose of the experiment: 2200 entries were allocated for the training set, while 275 entries each were designated for the verification and test sets, respectively. This distribution was meticulously planned to ensure a robust and thorough evaluation of the dataset. The data used in this study was sourced from the Tushare platform, an open-access repository for financial big data. Our analysis focused on key financial indices, including the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) and NASDAQ. These indices were selected due to their established impact on market trends and economic indicators, providing important context for understanding the dynamics of the edamame futures market. The primary dataset comprised edamame futures trading activities on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, totaling 2,750 data entries. The choice to focus on edamame futures was driven by the significant economic impact and high market price volatility associated with this commodity. To ensure a robust and comprehensive evaluation, we employed a carefully designed data segmentation strategy: 2,200 entries were allocated to the training set, while 275 entries each were designated for the validation and test sets. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of the dataset and enhances the reliability of the experimental results. By incorporating these key financial indices as external influences and focusing on the edamame futures price data, our study aims to contextualize the analysis within a broader economic landscape. This approach enhances the accuracy and relevance of our findings, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the edamame futures market. The adopted methodology for data standardization is encapsulated by the following mathematical representation: (12) In this equation, Vt signifies the interpolated value at time t, while Vt−1 and Vt−2 represent the recorded data from the immediate and second preceding trading days at time t, respectively. Subsequent to this interpolation, a comprehensive integration of the influencing factors and the edamame futures data is conducted. Given the substantial variance often present in the magnitudes of different features within the dataset, there is a potential risk of inadequate learning by the algorithm. This approach normalizes the data, scaling the features to a uniform range of [0, 1], thereby enhancing algorithmic learning efficiency. The experimental design, as depicted in Fig 8, incorporates a step size of 1 and a sequence length of 7. With a total data length of 2750, the data is restructured into a three-dimensional format, yielding a final dimension of (2744, 7, 12). This reconfiguration involves grouping the data into segments of seven rows and eight columns, starting from x − 6 data points. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g008 The efficacy of neural networks in generalizing performance often surpasses that of linear models, attributed to their intricate parameter architecture. However, this complexity necessitates meticulous fine-tuning of numerous hyperparameters to achieve optimal generalization capabilities. In this experimental framework, an initial range for the optimal hyperparameters was established based on prior experiential knowledge. We conducted Bayesian optimization privately to search for optimal hyperparameters. However, we discovered that extreme hyperparameter optimization could lead to a reduction in the model’s generalization performance. While the chosen reasonable hyperparameter values based on experience may not yield the best results on our specific dataset, they help ensure that the models are less sensitive to parameter variations, promoting better generalization and ease of fine-tuning. Regarding the choice of 32 units in Table 3, this value was selected based on our prior experience and considering the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency. We acknowledge that exploring a wider range of unit values could potentially improve performance. However, our primary focus was on maintaining consistency across models to enable a fair comparison. We believe that the chosen hyperparameter values strike a balance between model performance and generalization ability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t003 In addition to the hyperparameter optimization techniques discussed earlier, we also incorporated early stopping criteria into our model training process to further enhance the model’s generalization ability and prevent overfitting. Early stopping is a widely used regularization technique in machine learning that involves monitoring the model’s performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade. To implement early stopping, we split our data into training, validation, and test sets. During the training process, we monitored the model’s performance on the validation set at each epoch. If the model’s performance on the validation set did not improve for a specified number of epochs (defined as the patience parameter), the training was stopped, and the model weights from the best-performing epoch were retained. This approach allowed us to determine the optimal value for the patience parameter that maximized the model’s performance on the validation set while preventing overfitting. The incorporation of early stopping criteria into our model training process not only improved the model’s performance but also provided a more rigorous and comprehensive analysis of our approach. By leveraging this technique, we ensured that our proposed CIMA-AttGRU model is robust, reliable, and capable of generalizing well to unseen data. The performance of these models was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2, seen in Fig 9. The results, detailed in Table 4, were derived using the test dataset. These results highlighted that the conventional regression model SVR exhibited the least predictive accuracy. Within the realm of deep learning models, AttGRU demonstrated superior performance over Attention-GRU, with CIMA-AttGRU emerging as the most effective predictive model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t004 A comparative analysis, as evidenced in Table 4, reveals that the AttGRU model achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the standard GRU model. This improvement is quantified by a reduction in MAE by 7.47, a decrease in RMSE by 8.72. Similarly, when comparing the CIMA-enhanced models, CIMA-AttGRU outperformed CIMA-Attention-GRU, evidenced by a reduction in MAE by 7.41, a decrease in RMSE by 8.10. The comparative visualization of predicted versus actual values for GRU, Attention- GRU, Attention-NGU, AttGRU, CIMA-Attention-GRU, and CIMA-AttGRU models is provided in Fig 10. This graphical representation underscores the enhanced predictive capabilities of the CIMA-AttGRU model over its counterparts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g010 To assess the individual contributions of the CIMA and AttGRU components to the forecasting performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model, we designed a series of ablation experiments depicted in Fig 11. These experiments were structured to incrementally remove key components from the full model and evaluate the resulting impact on prediction accuracy. The experiments were conducted on a dataset comprising edamame futures prices, with the following configurations for model evaluation: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g011 The outcomes of the ablation study are summarized in Table 4, highlighting the performance metrics across different model configurations. The ablation study reveals the critical role played by both CIMA and AttGRU in enhancing the forecasting performance of the model. While the base GRU model provides a baseline for comparison, the addition of CIMA preprocessing significantly reduces both MAE and RMSE, indicating the importance of noise reduction and signal decomposition in improving prediction accuracy. The incorporation of the attention mechanism via AttGRU layers further improves the model’s ability to capture temporal dependencies, as evidenced by the reduced error metrics. The full CIMA-AttGRU model, combining both CIMA preprocessing and AttGRU, achieves the best performance across all metrics. This underscores the synergy between CIMA’s ability to prepare the data through signal decomposition and the AttGRU’s capabiity to focus on relevant temporal features, leading to more accurate predictions of edamame futures prices. To rigorously evaluate the predictive performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model relative to other models, we employed the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test [46] to compare the statistical significance of differences in prediction accuracy. The DM test is a widely used non-parametric statistical test for comparing the forecast errors of two models. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the predictive accuracy of the two models. If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), the null hypothesis can be rejected, indicating a significant difference in the models’ performance. We selected six main benchmark models (SVR, LSTM, GRU, Attention-LSTM, Attention-GRU, AttGRU, Attention-AttGRU, and CIMA-Attention-GRU) and conducted pairwise comparisons with the CIMA-AttGRU model. The test results are presented in Table 5. As shown, the CIMA-AttGRU model demonstrates statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy compared to all other models (p < 0.05). The absolute values of the DM statistics and the magnitude of the p-values are consistent with the performance metrics in Table 4, indicating that models with larger performance gaps have larger absolute DM statistics and smaller corresponding p-values. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t005 The DM test results provide strong evidence supporting the superior performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model in the task of soybean futures price prediction. The integration of CIMA decomposition and attention mechanism enables the model to better capture the intrinsic patterns in the data and enhance the accuracy of predictions. These findings are consistent with the experimental results presented throughout the paper, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed model. The statistical significance tests add robustness to our claims about the CIMA-AttGRU model’s performance and strengthen the overall credibility of the research. By demonstrating the model’s statistically significant improvements over a range of benchmark models, we provide compelling evidence for its practical value in forecasting soybean futures prices. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model in predicting soybean futures prices compared to other benchmark models. This can be attributed to its unique architecture, which combines CIMA for noise reduction and AttGRU for capturing dynamic temporal dependencies. CIMA enables the model to filter out market noise and decompose the time series data into intrinsic modes, addressing the high volatility in agricultural markets. This allows the model to focus on essential features and underlying patterns, leading to improved prediction accuracy. The AttGRU component, with its attention mechanism, dynamically adjusts to temporal dependencies, enabling the model to capture nuanced fluctuations in futures prices often overlooked by traditional models. The attention mechanism helps prioritize relevant information and adapt to changing market conditions. The incorporation of CADA enhances the model’s robustness by addressing domain adaptivity, which is crucial for soybean futures, where price determinants vary significantly over time and across regions. CADA aligns feature distributions between source and target domains, improving generalization ability and adaptability to new market conditions. The ablation study highlights the individual contributions of CIMA and AttGRU components to the overall performance, showing their crucial roles in improving prediction accuracy. While CIMA-AttGRU demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy, its increased complexity may lead to longer training times and higher computational requirements. Future research could explore ways to optimize the model’s architecture and training process to improve efficiency without compromising predictive performance. In this study, we propose the CIMA-AttGRU model for predicting soybean futures prices. The model combines CIMA for noise reduction and AttGRU for capturing temporal dependencies, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark models. The experimental results, supported by statistical tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of CIMA-AttGRU in capturing the complex dynamics of the soybean futures market and providing accurate predictions. The model’s ability to filter out noise, focus on relevant features, and adapt to changing market conditions makes it valuable for stakeholders in the soybean industry. The proposed architecture can be adapted to other agricultural commodities and financial markets, where accurate forecasting is crucial. Future research directions include incorporating additional external factors and exploring the integration of CIMA-AttGRU with other machine learning techniques to improve its generalization ability and adaptability. In conclusion, CIMA-AttGRU represents a significant advancement in agricultural market forecasting, providing a powerful tool for predicting soybean futures prices. Its superior performance, robustness, and adaptability contribute to the growing body of research on the application of advanced machine learning techniques in the financial and agricultural sectors.

Intel (INTC-2.11%) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA+2.17%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA-0.65%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight behind a computing company that’s coming for Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.95%) dominance of the artificial intelligence chip market. Bezos Expeditions, the Amazon (AMZN+2.18%) founder’s private investment vehicle, was part of a $693 million funding round for Tenstorrent, the company announced Monday. He joined LG Electronics and Fidelity in the round led by South Korean firms Samsung Securities and AFW Partners. “We are excited by the breadth of investors that believe in our vision,” Keith Witek, the chief operating officer of Tenstorrent, in a statement. “If you look at this group, you see a balance of financial investors and strategic investors, as well as some notable individuals that have conviction in our plans for AI.” Tenstorrent said it will use the money to “build out open-source AI software stacks, hire developers, expand its global development and design centers, and build systems and clouds for AI developers.” The company has strived to provide more accessible and affordable solutions for companies looking to develop their AI capabilities, putting itself in direct competition with fellow Santa Clara, California-based firm Nvidia. So far, it has signed about $150 million in contracts, Tenstorrent said. Currently the second-most valuable company in the world behind Apple (AAPL-0.06%), Nvidia is a Wall Street powerhouse and a behemoth in the AI chip space. Last month, it reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, with 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — coming from only three unnamed customers. Those sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to filing. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google (GOOGL+1.31%) parent Alphabet, Meta (META-0.97%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.28%), and Tesla (TSLA+0.28%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. But smaller companies are struggling to build up their AI capabilities as Big Tech firms corner the market — and power-hungry AI chips remain prohibitively expensive. That’s where Tenstorrent is hoping to come in. Founder and CEO Jim Keller told Bloomberg that Tenstorrent uses open-source and commonplace technology to provide engineering solutions that put AI in reach for more firms, and skips costly and complex parts, including like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used by Nvidia. “You can’t beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,” Keller said. “But they’ll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.” Open-source technology has become increasingly popular amid the AI boom, given its cost effectiveness. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company’s first open-source, multimodal large language model, Llama 3.2, will be the way forward. “It’s sort of like the Linux of AI, and we’re seeing closed-source labs react by trying to slash their prices to compete with Llama,” he said at Meta’s annual Connect conference in September.

The driving theme of […] Now, let's consider one of the highest-profile companies today, and that's artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In fact, Nvidia just completed its most recent stock split in June after the shares soared past $900 earlier in the year -- and then surged past $1,000 after Nvidia's announcement of the split. Is it possible that Nvidia, so soon after that operation, could decide to launch another stock split? Let's discuss the pros and cons of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNC.Y) and decide whether their stocks are good buys. With shares up by a whopping 179% year to date, Nvidia has been one of 2024's top performers as it continues to dominate the generative artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Revenue jumped 94% to $35.1 billion, driven by continued demand for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to run and train AI algorithms. The S&P 500 has been soaring, heading for a 25% increase this year, and that's prompted a lot of investors to think about how they might get in on this action. After all, if you invest in the S&P 500, you're taking positions in the top companies driving today's economy. On top of that, the S&P 500 has shown its strength over time, generating an annualized average return of more than 10% since its debut as a 500-company index. Bitcoin's price has been fluctuating around $97,300 as of Dec. 2, 2024, and is struggling to break past the $100,000 mark.

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Bullish Take on Robinhood (HOOD): Is It the Future of Investing?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Is Talking About These 10 Stocks Heading Into December. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December. Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about President-elect Donald Trump’s Treasury pick and highlighted his enthusiasm for the stock market. “On the other hand, President Trump was all about Nielsen ratings when he was on The Apprentice, and as president, he repeatedly said, The Dow Jones Industrial Average all-time high, and the S&P 500 were his new Nielsen ratings. He likes being rated, he likes to win, and he wants that stock market to go up to ratify his performance. That’s a big reason why the market exploded higher when he won.” Cramer also discussed Trump’s Treasury pick Scott Bessent’s possible 3-3-3 plan that calls for bringing the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP, 3% growth and producing 3 million barrels of oil per day. Jim Cramer said he is skeptical about Elon Musk’s efficiency plans in the upcoming Trump administration. “Can there be a legitimate top-to-bottom change in the efficiency of our government and its associated costs? Count me as a skeptic about any attempt to change the government, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s Doge thing, because every penny of spending in the budget has a constituency. When you add all those proposed cutbacks together, you face tremendous opposition. But that’s not the point. What matters is that this Treasury Secretary-designate is a serious person.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A successful business person confidently managing their finances on a mobile device. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a Mad Dash episode on CNBC sounded bullish on Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) because of the company’s success in attracting younger Americans who are interested in investing: “This is the king, okay? These guys have the next generation. The other guys have the people who watch fire shows and hospital shows and detective shows. These guys have the young; they watch TikTok, they watch YouTube, and they watch their handhelds and trade crypto.” Can HOOD shares go higher in the future? In the latest earnings call with analysts, Robinhood’s CFO, Jason Warnick, highlighted the company’s significant growth in recent quarters, which has pushed it to an all-time high of 2.2 million Robinhood Gold subscribers. This growth, he noted, is part of Robinhood’s unique approach. Few other brokers manage to charge a subscription fee for using their platform. Robinhood Gold plays a crucial role in monetizing the company’s user base, but it’s only one aspect of its broader strategy. “And one of the most exciting new parts of the Gold program is our Robinhood Gold card. When I’ve talked to Robinhood customers in recent months, the Gold card almost always comes up. If someone has it, they love it. If they don’t have it, they want to know when they’re going to get it. And I hear you. We’re working hard to increase the rollout, but we’re also being patient and carefully studying customer behavior as we grow so that we manage credit risk to profitably scale over time. While it’s still early, I wanted to share some emerging data from our 100,000 Gold card customers. First, customers love the Gold card. App store ratings continue to be five out of five with over 10,000 five-star reviews. Customers tell us they love the metal card, the digital app, and of course, the 3% rewards,” the company’s CEO Vlad Tenev said on the call. Read the entire call transcript here. Recently, Robinhood expanded its reach by acquiring TradePMR, a firm specializing in brokerage and custodian services for Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), in a deal valued at approximately $300 million. The move is seen as part of Robinhood’s push into the retirement account market. As of Q2 2024, the Investment Company Institute reported around $40 trillion in retirement investment assets in the U.S. Robinhood’s estimated forward revenue growth stands at 26.79% year-over-year, nearly 393.55% above the sector median of 5.43%. Overall, HOOD ranks 7th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December. While we acknowledge the potential of HOOD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HOOD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Me encontré un enlace oficial y actualizado a la lista de dominios de primer nivel de la IANA (la Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, que se encarga de estas cosas). Allí se indican esos dominios «extra» que se inventaron además de los de los países (.es, .pt, .ft, etcétera) y los genéricos de toda la vida (.com, .net, etcétera), lo que hizo que empezaran a aparecer otros nuevos y originales con denominaciones interesantes, además de –ya puestos– las marcas comerciales. Tal vez nunca te hayas topado con uno o no te hayas fijado por dónde navegabas: funcionan exactamente igual que los normales y también se les pueden asignar direcciones de correo como a los de toda la vida. Echarle un vistazo es realmente interesante, porque los hay a cual más curioso: Para empezar, hay muchos que empiezan por XN-- que se corresponden con palabras que incluyen caracteres especiales: la ñ, o de idiomas como el árabe o el hindi. Ese código se conoce como Punycode y proviene del RFC3492, que convierte Unicode a caracteres válidos en esos dominios. Luego están otros como .gal y .eus para Galicia y Euskadi, pero no en cambio otros que se solicitaron en su día como .telefonica o .terra (d.e.p.) En cambio .zara, que se pidió en esa época (2010s) sí que está. Se decía que esos dominios costaban más de 25.000 dólares al año y unos 185.000 cuando se solicitaban por primera vez. ¿Qué otras marcas están por ahí presentes? Alibaba, Airtel, AmericanExpress, Apple, Barcalys, Bloomberg, Cisco, Epson, Ericsson, Ferrari, Ferrero, Gallo, Google, IBM, LaCaixa, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Mango, Omega, Panasonic, Philips, Yahoo, Walmart, Windows y Zara… así a simple vista. También hay genéricos como .adult, .business, .date, .earth, .energy, .global, .holiday, .map, .movie, .security o .viajes (el único que he visto en español). El hecho de que sitios como Iberia.viajes no lleven a Iberia ya dice mucho de lo que se puede esperar de algunos de estos dominios, para sorpresa de nadie.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. xAI founder Elon Musk has raised billions in funding for his AI startup in the past few months. Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Just like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge.

Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

Title: These 5 ‘Special’ Dividends Are More Than One-Hit Wonders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/02/these-5-special-dividends-are-more-than-one-hit-wonders/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T12:30:00Z

Piggy bank with business stuff, business and finance concept, vintage color tone. Today we’ll discuss a 5.4% dividend that actually annualizes to 7%. A 5.7% payer that really dishes 12.4%. And even a headline 15% yield that is understated because the company handed out 16.1% last year. Wait. What? These “typos” fool the mainstream financial websites. We are discussing special dividends today. Payouts that are awarded as a bonus to regular quarterly dividends. Only a select few firms dish specials. Sometimes, it’s thanks to a sudden influx of money. Let’s take billboard and transit display giant Outfront Media (OUT) which sold its Canadian business for C$410 million in cash in June. Fast forward to November, and Outfront announced a massive 75-cent special dividend on top of its 30-cent quarterly dividend, vaulting its 12-month yield from a healthy 6.3% to a mouth-watering 10.2%. This, of course, was a one-off special—not one that we are looking to bank on annually. We want “the other” type of special payer. The company that says it’s a one-off, but makes the payment every single year. These tend to fall into one of two camps: These are the stocks that can pay us more specials in the future. Their current yields are often understated today, because specials don’t count in the annual yield calculations. Today we’ll review five generous special payers. Mainstream financial websites list their yields between 5.4 and 15.0%. But they actually paid 7.0% to 16.1% over the past year. Let’s see if history is on pace to repeat or, at least, rhyme. Ford (F) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.4% Dividend Yield With Specials: 7.0% Ford (F) hardly needs an introduction—it’s an American automotive pioneer, and its F-Series has held the title of world’s best-selling truck for nearly a half-century. But Ford doesn’t necessarily have the world’s happiest shareholders. On a pure share-price basis, Ford—across a number of ups and downs—is effectively flat since 1994. That’s zero price returns—if anyone has held for two decades, their only gains as of right now have come from the dividend. That dividend, however, is mighty interesting. Ford temporarily suspended its dividend in 2020 as COVID reared its ugly head, then brought it back at 10 cents per share for a few quarters before returning it to the pre-pandemic 15-cent level. However, instead of just raising its regular past 15 cents, Ford has spent the past two Februarys announcing special dividends—first 63 cents in 2023, then a more modest 18 cents in 2024. That’s part of a stated plan to distribute 40%-50% of free cash flow every year—and if the regular doesn’t do the job, shareholders will get a supplemental payout. (Ford’s FCF in 2023 was $6.8 billion; it’s guiding for $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion this year, so we could assume a decently higher special in 2025 compared to 2024.) But we need more than a nice dividend. And on that front, it’s tough to be overly positive. Ford’s earnings are expected to decline by about 10% this year before leveling out in 2025. The company’s traditional, hybrid and fleet vehicles are generally doing well, though its electric-vehicle arm continues to struggle and deliver thick (albeit shrinking) losses. Meanwhile, while Ford should reach its expected $2 billion in cost cuts this year, warranty costs and inflation are still holding the automaker back. But F shares are cheap, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of around 6.5, and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) of 0.65. (A stock with a PEG below 1.0 is considered undervalued.) Equinor (EQNR) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.7% Dividend Yield With Specials: 12.4% Equinor (EQNR) is little-known to most American investors, though it will occasionally pop up on the radar of anyone seeking out great yields in the energy patch. This Norwegian energy firm is actually two-thirds state-owned, has operations in roughly 30 countries (though most of its production comes from the Norwegian Continental Shelf), and produces roughly 2.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. While it’s heavy in traditional oil and gas operations, Equinor has increasingly delved into renewables and low-carbon solutions, and has pledged to become a net-zero energy company by 2050. It owns a nearly 10% stake in Danish wind firm Orsted, and generated 677 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable power in its most recent quarter. Indeed, its focus on green energy—largely a product of Norway’s more ambitious energy targets—has hamstrung the firm compared to energy majors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are still doggedly investing in traditional energy extraction. Equinor also has one of the most potent special dividends. Indeed, Equinor has paid out “ordinary” and “extraordinary” dividends over the past few years. Its past three specials have been equal to the 35-cent regular distribution, with the fourth coming out to 60 cents per share. All told, those extraordinary dividends have added a whopping 6.7 points to EQNR’s yield. That’s on top of what has been an uber-generous buyback program. But this is where diving into company reports comes in handy. Seeing as how Equinor isn’t exactly a first-to-mind energy stock to most Americans, there hasn’t been much (some, but not much) reporting on that extraordinary dividend floating away. But indeed, a bullet point in the company’s 2023 full-year report noted: “Expect to conclude extraordinary cash dividend after 2024.” The ordinary dividend will not only stay, but EQNR has pledged to grow it by 2 cents per share annually. That should result in a still-nice yield in this Norwegian energy major—but nothing approaching the wild 12.4% its most recent specials have produced. Business development companies (BDCs)—effectively private equity for us regular Joes—are extremely over-represented among companies offering regular-and-supplemental payouts. Among them are: Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) Listed Dividend Yield: 8.9% Dividend Yield With Specials: 10.0% I’m on record as saying Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) has “sterling dividend stewardship,” and that’s still the case today. Sixth Street is a flexible provider of funding to middle-market companies, dealing in senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, non-control structured equity and common equity. A quick look at its ideal investment prospects: Its portfolio currently sits at 115 companies spread across 15 “sector franchises,” such as sports/media/entertainment/telecom, credit market strategies, asset-based finance, and real estate. It boasts exciting names like gen-AI provider Sprinklr and parking compliance platform Passport, but also challenged retailers such as J.C. Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond. TSLX has largely been a well-managed BDC, though last quarter, it added a non-accrual (Lithium Technologies) to bring its total to three, representing roughly 2% of investments at fair value. That’s still a low level, however—Sixth Street still has a great track record of delivering high RoE and making intelligent deals. It also has a smart distribution system in which TSLX pays a core dividend, then distributes 50% of net investment income (NII) in excess of that core dividend as supplemental payouts, keeping the BDC from overextending itself. Over the past 12 months, specials have accounted for about 1.1 extra percentage points’ worth of yield. But we pretty much have to overpay to buy shares. TSLX stock routinely trades at a massive premium to net asset value (NAV), and that’s still the case today—its 22% premium puts it among the five most expensive BDCs right now. BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) Listed Dividend Yield: 15.0% Dividend Yield With Specials: 16.1% BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) is another BDC, this one externally managed, that invests in the debt of middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. TCPC currently has 156 companies in its portfolio, spread across a few dozen industries. But it does have a few heavier concentrations—internet software and services (~14%), software (~14%) and diversified financial services (~13%) earn double-digit weights. Earlier this year, TCPC merged with BlackRock Capital Investment Corp., which I previously mentioned came with a tangible benefit: a 25-basis-point reduction in base management fees, to 1.25%, bringing it a little lower than the industry midpoint. But I was also curious to see whether BlackRock TCP Capital would still keep its special dividends. Yes, I know—what does it matter if TCPC is already doling out a massive 15%? Well, it means that TCPC isn’t necessarily overpromising on its regular dividend. That said, the most recent dividend announcement marked a fifth consecutive regular payout of 34 cents per share, keeping it a penny shy of its pre-COVID levels and raising a little concern that TCPC’s dividend might be plateauing, at least in the short-term. The flip side? We can buy TCPC at a decent discount of 10% to NAV. However, portfolio quality isn’t as ideal as it is with TSLX. Non-accruals are close to 4% at fair value, and watchlist investments increased from 2.6% to 3%. Higher debt costs are weighing on operational performance, too. Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) Listed Dividend Yield: 9.5% Dividend Yield With Specials: 11.1% Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) is another externally managed BDC, and that manager is a subsidiary of multinational asset manager Carlyle Group (CG). CGBD invests primarily in U.S. middle market companies with between $25 million and $100 million in annual EBITDA. Its investments lean heavily toward first-lien debt (68%), though it also works through second-lien debt and equity, and it also holds investment funds. Its 128 portfolio companies cover a couple dozen industries, including healthcare/pharmaceuticals, software, aerospace/defense and leisure products/services. CGBD came public in 2017, but it has spent its short publicly traded life putting up extremely respectable returns, including mammoth outperformance coming out of the pandemic lows. Better still? Investors have been treated to both a growing base dividend (including an 8% raise in 2024), as well as regular supplemental payouts that have boosted yield by 1.6 percentage points over the past year. CGBD is building a stellar track record, but a few pockmarks are emerging. Lower short-term rates are putting downward pressure on its portfolio yield (it declined 70 bps last quarter), NAV per share and net investment income also declined in Q3, and repayments continue to run ahead of originations. Shares are even a little overheated, at a slight premium to NAV. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Learn more If you've waited this long to pick up one of the best Meta Quest Cyber Monday deals, then give yourself a quick pat on the back, then get yourself to the checkout with the bundle before it sells out again. The affordable VR headsets have been one of the most popular items in our roundup of best Cyber Monday deals and this is the last day for many promotions - we've some expire this morning. This best one still available is a Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game and a three-month subscription to Meta Quest+ to play a fresh rotating catalog of games. All this for $299 on the 128GB model at Amazon. That's a $74 saving today. Earlier, there were a couple of coupons (QUEST75 and QUEST100) on this deal for free Amazon credit, but that offer seems to have expired. Even so, it's worth trying them during the checkout process, just in case they get switched back on. Above bundles also come with three months of Meta Quest+. It's too soon to get a discount on the new Meta Quest 3S hardware, but the discounts on bundled extras are excellent today. All purchases currently come with a free download of the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game - which is lauded as one of the best titles you can play on the new headset. You'll certainly want to get it free, as buying the game separately costs $50. When the older Quest 3 launched last year, it came with Asura'a Wrath 2 for free for a while, and that game still costs $60 if bought separately, so don't sleep on this on these Meta Quest 3S bundles. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). Highlights Specifics The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The full-sized Meta Quest 3 is an odd duck right now. It's only a year old and still an excellent piece of hardware with a slightly better resolution than the new 3S, but it costs $200 more. Granted, you're getting a more advanced piece of kit (not by much, though, in all honesty) and a much larger storage capacity at 512GB instead of the 128GB/256GB options the 3S comes in. Meta has kept up production, though, and like the Quest 3S, you can get a free code for Batman: Arkham Shadow with purchases, which adds another $50 value to the deal below. We'll keep our eyes peeled for further discounts for the rest of the Cyber Monday sales. The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. Highlights Specifics The Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2) has officially been discontinued, and we haven't seen any new units in stock for quite some time. Plenty of refurbished ones are knocking around, but most are more expensive than the new Quest 3S, which is a poor value today, given the Quest 3S is a more advanced VR headset than the Quest 2. As such, we won't highlight deals for the Quest 2 unless they're ridiculously cheap - say $100-$150. And even then, they'll be refurbs/preowned. Nothing of note showed up on Black Friday, so we'd assume the same for the remaining time of Cyber Monday sales. Cyber Monday lands on December 2. While we often see a few deals hang on for a few extra days, the really strong hardware ones usually snap shut right at the end of Cyber Monday itself. We'd go off midnight PT as a rule of thumb, but waiting that long is a luxury you shouldn't indulge with the best bundles, especially that mad Amazon. Both are already involved, yes. The main Quest 3 is over a year old, so it is in a great position to be discounted - and it needs one, to be honest, given the 3S is much cheaper and the best option for most buyers. So far, it's just bundled freebies instead of a discount. That being said, Meta discontinued the 128GB one and made the 512GB one the only option, but lowered the price of it to the 128's old price at $499. So you're already getting a better deal than last year. However, we still think you should be eyeing up the Cyber Monday Quest 3S deals above instead. The Meta Quest 3S was only released in October this year, but even so, it's come up with the best bundle options so far, with free extras worth up to $174 on the 128GB model.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone, or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Cyber Monday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Cyber Monday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Cyber Monday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Save money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad first. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. However, there are some discounts on previous models: U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Cyber Monday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85 percent (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75 percent off at $1.99 a month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is offering subscriptions for $8 a month, 50 percent off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV+, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-day trial or even Apple’s 3 months for free if you buy an Apple product. In fact, there are even some Cyber Monday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals: Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go.

Cyber Monday 2024 Cyber Monday Deals Cyber Monday Tech Deals Best Buy Deals Cyber Monday Apple Deals Cyber Monday Laptop Deals Cyber Monday Toy Deals Cyber Monday Coffee Deals Cyber Monday Mattress Deals Cyber Monday Outdoor Deals Cyber Monday TV Deals Cyber Monday Camera Deals Branch Cyber Monday Deals If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Cyber Monday may be over, but the deals are still going strong—for now. Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Every item on this list has been vetted, tested, and loved by someone at WIRED. Our Gear team has cross-checked these picks with our buying guides to ensure you're getting the lowest prices—or close to it. Don't wait too long, though. These prices won't stick around forever—some may already expire by the time you reach the end of this story. Jump to Category Our Process We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. To find you the best deals, we use a proprietary tool that scans prices on everything we've reviewed over the last two years and spotlights notable price changes. We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor.

It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

Title: It's a really bad time to be a middle manager
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-manager-hiring-white-collar-recession-layoffs-jobs-efficiency-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-02T09:03:01Z
Full Content:
America is undergoing a rapid corporate restructuring — and middle managers are in big trouble Over the past two years, American businesses have been engaged in a rapid-fire restructuring of their corporate hierarchies. In the name of "flattening," they've been waging war on middle managers — trimming an entire tier of supervisory jobs that Mark Zuckerberg derided as nothing more than "managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work." Following Meta's lead, Citi reduced its 13 layers of management to eight. UPS axed 12,000 of its 85,000 managers. And in September, Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. "I hate bureaucracy," CEO Andy Jassy declared, echoing the zeal for "efficiency" that Elon Musk, one of the pioneers of the current corporate flattening, is now seeking to unleash on the halls of government. But here's the thing: It's not just that tens of thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. It's that the jobs themselves have been eliminated — and they may not be coming back. To test that theory, I asked Revelio Labs, a workforce analytics provider, to crunch the numbers for me, using its database of job postings aggregated from across the internet. It divided employees into two buckets of managers (senior leadership and middle management) and two buckets of lower-level employees (experienced associates and junior workers). Then it looked at how many job openings employers are posting today, compared with the hiring heyday of 2022. What the data reveals is stark. Earlier this year, when white-collar hiring was at its lowest point, openings for junior roles — entry-level positions requiring little to no prior experience — were down by 14%. But hiring had plunged by 43% for middle managers and 57% for senior leaders. If you had any sort of management experience, your job prospects were bleak. Since then, though, we've seen a significant rebound in job postings for almost everyone — except middle managers. In October, employers were still advertising 42% fewer middle-management positions than they did in April 2022. Which means that those who lost their jobs in the Great Flattening are now facing a whole new horror: There aren't any positions left for them to take. The assault on middle managers dates back to the 1980s, when globalization gave rise to a new philosophy of management that prioritized cost cutting over everything else. Supervisors — earning big salaries for rubber-stamping the work of their subordinates — became an easy target. Trim the fat, the thinking went, and the efficiencies will follow. From 1986 to 1998, one study found, the number of managers reporting to division heads dropped by 25%. At the same time, the number of managers reporting directly to a CEO nearly doubled. Executives got the flattening that they wanted. But it's unclear whether getting rid of middle managers actually made companies run more efficiently. As I wrote last year, one study found that businesses with fewer layers of management were able to deliver their products faster. But study after study found that when middle managers do their jobs right, they bolster performance more than either top executives or ground-level employees. Supervisors do real work. They motivate. They mentor. They communicate critical information to and from different parts of the company. They smooth out glitches and spot opportunities. They're the ones who keep the trains running. But now is an especially bad time to be an experienced supervisor. According to an analysis by Live Data Technologies, another workforce analytics provider, middle managers made up 32% of layoffs last year, compared with 20% in 2019. And as the data from Revelio Labs shows, companies appear to have no intention of refilling those supervisory roles, even as they resume hiring for lower-level jobs. That has created a double whammy for middle managers: There's a sharp spike in job seekers, and they're competing for an increasingly small universe of open roles. Over the past year I've heard from hundreds of managers mired in this double whammy. What's struck me is how eerily similar their stories are. They all come across as smart and articulate. They're all in their late 40s to 50s. When they got laid off from their supervisory jobs, they didn't expect their job search to be too difficult. After all, they'd spent decades honing their skills and climbing the corporate ladder, often at leading companies. Surely, all that experience had to count for something. But despite sending out hundreds of applications, they can't get anyone to return their calls. They're utterly baffled, and they all have the same question: What is going on here? It's the question I've been asking, too — combing through government data, talking to employers and economists, studying applicant-tracking systems. Because so many of the frustrated job seekers are older, I thought maybe we were seeing some new form of age discrimination: Call it the Curse of the Gen X Professional. But it's only after seeing the data from Revelio Labs that I finally understand what's going on: There just aren't enough supervisory jobs to go around anymore. In response, many displaced managers have swallowed their pride and started applying to jobs lower on the corporate food chain. As Revelio Labs' data shows, nonmanagerial jobs are faring much better these days — and you'd think companies would be thrilled to get the experience and know-how of seasoned professionals on the cheap. But take the example of a former middle manager I'll call Rick, who is 54. After getting rejected for all the supervisory jobs he could find, he widened his search to include entry-level positions — only to be rejected for being overqualified. At this point, all Rick wants is a chance to prove himself. "Forget the titles, forget all that other stuff," he told me. "I just need a job. My unemployment runs out in about 30 days. I'll come in and do a great job for you." This is the paradox that lies at the heart of the Great Flattening: The very experience that should be a selling point for senior leaders has become a liability. Some have tried deleting former jobs from their resumes, to hide their supervisory experience. Others, like Rick, omit the year they graduated from college. One former chief operating officer, whose search has gone so poorly that she's now applying to be an executive assistant, told me she addresses her overqualified-ness in her cover letters. "I understand that my résumé has some big titles on it, but let me tell you who I am at heart," she writes. "I really want to be doing this, and I'm not wedded to the title." What all the out-of-work managers want to know is: When is the hiring freeze for supervisors going to thaw? That depends, in large part, on whether companies come to view the flattening as a success. Many CEOs insist they aren't getting rid of middle managers just to save money. They think having fewer layers of management will, as Zuckerberg put it, create a "stronger" company that can build "higher-quality products faster." That hints at a dark prospect for managers like Rick: The rung of the corporate ladder they spent their careers reaching could be gone for good. There's a chance, of course, that the current craze for corporate flattening could ease over time. Companies are already discovering that having few middle managers is placing an enormous strain on their operations. The supervisors who survived the purge have been forced to take on much larger teams, and they're burned out to a crisp. Gen Zers, deprived of their mentors, are increasingly disengaged. Departments are more siloed than ever, with no one to do the tedious and thankless and essential work of coordinating across different teams. The best hope for managers like Rick is that CEOs are getting a real-time refresher in the value of managers. "I'm not at that point in my life where I'm ready to take that step back," Rick told me. "I just want to work with good people and enjoy what I'm doing. I could go to Domino's and start delivering pizza. But I know I can do a lot more than that."

Title: Bitcoin Strategy: Here’s What Michael Saylor Told Microsoft’s Leadership
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-what-michael-saylor-told-microsoft/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T07:15:21Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin evangelist, has held his 3-minute presentation to the Microsoft (MSFT) Board of Directors and CEO Satya Nadella, articulating why the company should adopt BTC as a reserve asset. Saylor, who was invited to present his insights, emphasized the critical importance of embracing the leading cryptocurrency as a cornerstone of modern financial strategy. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor declared at the outset of his presentation. He continued, “Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century. It represents digital capital.” Delving into the mechanics of global wealth distribution, Saylor highlighted the dichotomy between utility-providing assets and those dedicated to capital preservation. “Global wealth is distributed across assets that provide utility and others that preserve Capital, but risk is destroying trillions of dollars of that Capital every single year,” he explained. Saylor articulated BTC’s superiority over traditional forms of capital preservation, stating, “Digital capital is economically and technically superior to physical capital, and it represents a revolutionary advance in capital preservation.” He projected a significant expansion of Bitcoin as asset class, asserting, “The asset class itself is growing from trillions to hundreds of trillions of dollars and it is backed by digital power along with political and economic power.” Addressing the strategic financial decisions faced by large corporations like Microsoft, Saylor made a strong case for BTC’s central role. “It makes sense for Microsoft to be powered by digital capital. Bitcoin’s the best asset you can own. The numbers speak for themselves,” he stated unequivocally. He contrasted a BTC investment with traditional corporate financial maneuvers, arguing, “it makes a lot more sense to buy Bitcoin than to buy your own stock back or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds if you’re going to outperform. You’re going to need Bitcoin and those bonds are undermining your options market and your equity liquidity.” Saylor also underscored the burgeoning institutional and governmental support, reinforcing its viability as a strategic asset. “Luckily you have an alternative. Public support for Bitcoin is surging, as is political support, as is support for the US Bitcoin strategic reserve, as is Wall Street support and the president of the United States says ‘never sell your Bitcoin.’” Framing the current period as a transformative era, Saylor proclaimed, “We’re entering year one of the crypto Renaissance and you have a choice to make: cling to the past or embrace the future.” He cautioned against the financial stagnation associated with traditional investment strategies, stating, “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face.” He added, “if you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk. What if you could buy a hundred billion dollar company growing faster than Microsoft for one time revenue? What if you could keep doing it every single year? it’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options.” To facilitate the integration of BTC into Microsoft’s financial operations, Saylor also introduced an open-source model. “We’ve created an open-source model, you can plug in your own assumptions. You can convert your cash flows and your dividends and your buybacks and your debt into Bitcoin,” he explained. He projected substantial financial benefits from this integration, claiming, “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price. You can create trillions of dollars of enterprise value. You can strip away risk from your shareholders and you can prosper on the Bitcoin standard. So do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” The community reactions have been swift and varied following Saylor’s presentation. Luke Broyles from The Bitcoin Adviser commented via X: “58 slides in 191 seconds… or 3.2 seconds per slide. It is brilliant, hilarious, and frankly sad that Microsoft would only allow a 3 minute presentation from Michael Saylor. Brilliant to cover so many slides so investors/shareholders have to review them all. Hilarious that he was actually able to do it.” As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft shareholders are currently voting on whether the company should invest in BTC. The proposal, prompted by a shareholder initiative, suggests using corporate funds to purchase BTC. Microsoft’s board of directors has urged shareholders to reject the proposal, arguing against the strategic fit and potential risks associated with an investment. Shareholders can participate in the voting process online via proxy ahead of Microsoft’s annual shareholder meeting on December 10, 2024. At press time, BTC traded at $96,331.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style.

The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing.

It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown.

They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort.

As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion. The coziest version of the cult-favorite belt bag, this fleecy material adds a comfy, lived-in feel to any winter outfit.

It's equally at home at a formal event or a day on the town, and you can carry it as a top-handle bag, over-the-shoulder, or cross-body. This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a trade-in for $5/month for 36 months (three years), which amounts to $180. The deal requires the Unlimited Ultimate plan for the line that's using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you switch phones before the 36 months period, you'll have to pay off the remaining balance of phone.

AOC's 27-inch 1080p monitor features a curved screen and offers an impressive 240Hz refresh rate at an affordable price, making it a quality choice for competitive gamers on a budget. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The C255B-FWT240 model from Sceptre is a simple 1080p gaming monitor with an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate that's ideal for competitive gamers on a budget. It also features a 1ms response time, a 1500R curvature, AMD FreeSynce Premium, two DisplayPorts, and two HDMI ports. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system. The V15 Detect Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum is one of Dyson's most powerful models. It features HEPA filtration and laser illumination to reveal hidden debris. This model usually runs north of $700, but it's 40% off right now. We've never seen it priced this low. The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is just $50, and is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This self-cleaning, programmable coffee maker allows you to choose your brew strength, so you always get the perfect cup of coffee. This white nonstick cookware set can help enhance any kitchen. It includes frying pans, a stock pot, saucepans with lids, and more. The classic 3D Whitestrips take only 20 days of use to complete a full treatment and also come with two sets of "1 Hour Express" strips for more last-minute whitening sessions. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility. This multi-styler comes with six different options for brush heads, complete with a styling comb, filter cleaning brush, travel bag, and storage case. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world. A unique blend of Magnolia and musk with tangerine, the Fenty Eau de Parfum expresses itself uniquely on each wearer for a one-of-a-kind scent. Achieve the perfect lip combo with this three-piece gift set from Charlotte Tilbury. Customize with your favorite colors and finishes for a personal touch. Wearing sunscreen daily is a breeze with Kiehl’s lightweight SPF 50+ serum that protects from sun damage. It also improves skin tone and texture with a collagen peptide serum. The Erno Laszlo Sea Mud Deep Cleansing Bar uses high-end ingredients to unclog pores. If you love eyeshadow palettes, this three-piece collector’s set is too good to miss. It’s an incredible value and includes three gorgeous color stories ideal for holiday parties and beyond. The most recently confirmed shade of Taylor Swift's iconic red lipstick, this warm brown-ish red was worn by Taylor to a 2024 Chiefs game. This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. Apple's latest generation of AirPods features a new design to optimize comfort for wearers of every kind. It's powered by the H2 chip and uses a smaller case than ever. Apple's base AirPods are now available with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) without the use of in-ear tips. The new model uses the brand's H2 chip to power features like Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness. Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and noise canceling in a sleek, comfy design that’s tough to beat. Apple's update to the AirPods Max finally moves the headphones to USB-C charging and five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware and audio performance are largely the same. The Sonos Ace are the comfiest headphones we've reviewed. They also offer great noise-canceling and audio quality that rival top models from the competition. Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer noise-canceling performance that’s much better than it should be for the money, alongside solid sound quality and massive battery life. Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra once more put the brand on top, with best-in-class noise canceling wrapped in a sleek and comfy design. The Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian are the same as the standard Studio Pro wireless headphones, but with a color curated by Kim Kardashian. They are designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. We've spotlighted The Ultra Puffer in our round up of the best Abercrombie Cyber Monday deals because it's a lookalike to Aritzia's SuperPuff and only costs $120 (plus, you can get it for an extra 15% off with the code CYBERAF). "It's a bit puffy, but that's balanced nicely by the short silhouette and faux fur accents," writes freelance author Talia Ergas. "The hood is detachable, which gives me two looks in one. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out." Find more outerwear at a discount in our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals on women's winter coats. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily A spike in online shopping and sufficient turnouts in the malls, outlets and urban shopping districts over Black Friday weekend portend a healthy stretch ahead in the days leading to Christmas. So far, so good. After weeks of early discounting culminating on Black Friday, U.S. retailers saw enough gift shopping over the weekend to buoy hopes of meeting or beating their holiday sales goals. While traffic in stores on Black Friday and Saturday was slightly down to flat from a year ago, online traffic was robust. As consumers got into the holiday spending spirit, demand overcame inflation and cost of living concerns, at least temporarily. Purchasing on Friday and Saturday was also driven by the strong stock market, where on Friday the Dow closed at a record 44,910.65 points; less uncertainty due to the presidential election being decided, and weather conditions conducive to hitting the malls. Temperature drops on Friday and Saturday spurred sales of outerwear and winter accessories, which lagged through the fall; activewear also fared well. Retailers are generally managing inventories better, and utilizing AI more to gauge demand and generate flash sales.

Globally, Cyber Monday is seen driving $51 billion in online sales, up from $48.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, Salesforce said. The software giant also reported that during the first half of Cyber Week, retailers using GenAI in their service experience saw a 9 percent higher conversion rate compared to retailers who are not. Another software giant, Adobe, reported that on Black Friday U.S. consumers spent a $10.8 billion online, up 10.2 percent year-over-year. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., $11.3 million was spent online every minute on Black Friday, with toys, jewelry, appliances, personal care, apparel and electronics among the top-performing categories, Adobe reported. “Crossing the $10 billion mark is a big e-commerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was more anchored toward in-store shopping,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “And with consumers getting more comfortable with everything from mobile shopping to chatbots, we have tailwinds that can prop up online growth moving forward.” Mastercard reported that U.S. store and online sales on Black Friday, excluding automotive sales and unadjusted for inflation, were up 3.4 percent. “Black Friday was a good indicator of how the holiday season is positively shaping up,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “Our real-time insights show that consumers are comfortably in the gift-giving spirit as price reductions and deals occur across sectors, supporting budgets for holiday shopping.” Mastercard indicated that online retail sales on Black Friday increased 14.6 percent, while in-store sales were up just 0.7 percent, compared to Black Friday last year. Jewelry, electronics and apparel were cited as the top categories, with particular strength in apparel e-commerce. “Shoppers are making the most of seasonal deals and enjoying a balance of experiences spending and gifts for all loved ones,” said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard and former chairman and chief executive officer of Saks Inc. “They’re more strategic in their shopping, though, prioritizing promotions that they believe hold the greatest value — opening their wallets, but with more intentional distribution.” “Black Friday is no longer a day. It’s a season,” said Stephen Yalof, president and CEO of Tanger, the Greensboro, N.C.-based operator of 39 outlet centers and one lifestyle center. “The traffic starts building in late October/early November, and Tanger has been promoting Black Friday every day in November with different brands and sales to keep things exciting. Our traffic numbers this weekend beat last year. People are shopping in large groups. The whole family is coming out and shoppers are looking for deals.” Coach, Ralph Lauren, Columbia, American Eagle, Aerie, Viori, Nike, Adidas and Gap Inc. were among the busiest outlets in Tanger centers over the weekend, Yalof said. Asked if the deals were bigger this year than last year, Yalof replied, “I think so. The discounting started earlier this year than last year and a lot of the brands in some instances have better deals than last year, and on selected items. Yeti was on sale. I’ve never seen Yeti on sale.” The consumer mindset, he said, is to “shop now and come in early” for fear that a particular product would sell out. “There’s a frenzied-ness I haven’t seen in recent years. I think it’s fueled by the shorter selling season and the weather just turning cold.” Data from major software firms indicated that traffic at stores are down slightly from last year, but Yalof said, “Outlets are a different story. I visited a couple of full-price centers also and there were plenty of cars there, but the aspirational outlet shopper is looking for deals and they are lining up in our centers.” “Everything we got from our malls is really positive,” said Stephen Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based real estate investment trust, when asked to comment on Friday’s and Saturday’s business. “We had really good crowds early. The stores offering good promotions had lines. The parking lots were full by mid-morning and stayed busy all day Friday.” Lebovitz said the Wednesday before Thanksgiving saw a stronger turnout than the same day a year ago. “People were hitting it hard given the short holiday season.” Each year there’s typically a lull in business after Cyber Monday until 10 days to two weeks before Christmas. “Because of the shorter calendar, we don’t think there will be as much of a lull this year,” Lebovitz said. Stores selling activewear, casual apparel and cosmetics, and those offering promotions and good discounts fared the best, Lebovitz said, noting that consumers have been hit by “a barrage of emails and texts” from retailers. CBL has a total of 94 malls, and outlet, lifestyle and open-air centers, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest. “Things were good, not great,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. He said the weekend marked a return to shopping “normalcy” in the aftermath of COVID-19 and the subsequent spending splurge from federal assistance putting money into consumers’ pockets. Americans, Johnson said, are “shopping with a balance of wants and needs.” Johnson said transaction velocity was highest at Costco, Walmart, Amazon, Gap Inc. and Urban Outfitters. Category-wise, athleisure was a standout, with Lululemon, Viori, Alo and Free People performing well in the category, Johnson said. He also said that the promotional pace has been quite similar to last year, with discounts typically offering 30 percent off, with some up to 40 percent and select goods at the 50 percent mark. Almost all the retail promotions so far have been pre-planned. “There has not been any fire-sale pricing,” Johnson said. At Elyse Walker, which operates six Elyse Walker designer stores and two Towne specialty stores, “Black Friday was a very healthy kick-off to holiday shopping,” said Summer Holl, president. “While we ran a Black Friday weekend promo that drove motivated traffic — additional 20 percent off markdown in store and online — we had a great mix of full-price selling and appointments as well. Our Los Angeles flagship was up triple digits to Black Friday last year and we saw a 10 percent comp increase in our New York City flagship. Footwear, both sale and full price, was a top seller. Shoppers were looking for buy now, wear now deals, knits and outerwear. Full-price selling was driven by new designer deliveries from Celine, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Khaite and Altuzarra.” “I’m beyond happy,” said Chris Riccobono, founder of Untuckit, which operates 89 stores across the U.S. as well as a robust online business. “It was amazing.” He said the company launched its planned promotional sale a week early this year and was worried that the aggressive stance of some competitors might take a bite out of Untuckit’s business. That turned out not to be the case. “We held the same discount as we have for the past 13 years,” Riccobono said, with select items being offered at 50 and 60 percent off regular retail. “We comped up pretty significantly both in our stores and online. They’re not always in sync, but in this case, it was pretty even . . . . Everything was great last week — maybe [consumers] were just waiting for the election to end.” Bestsellers included the men’s wrinkle-free Veneto shirt program, Hemsworth flannel shirt, wrinkle-free Cadetto shirt, the Lawrence and Cord shirts, the Archer sweater flannel and the Traveler pant program. While Untuckit is primarily a men’s brand, the women’s Bella program and the Lexie Sequin shirtdress were top performers. Commenting on the business ahead, Riccobono said, “It’s held for eight days in a row so we feel like it’ll be a great holiday season.” “Our full-price retail was strong the last month and we experienced the same trend during Black Friday,” said Ken Ohashi, CEO of Brooks Brothers. The company’s stores and e-commerce performed similarly well. “They were neck and neck,” he said, “And we have significantly less clearance than last year. We’re pretty clean and our gross margin and maintained margin are up, so we’re feeling good.” As a result, the company moved some dollars previously spent on affiliate marketing to more traditional advertising such as billboards, television and out-of-home ads. “It’s helping us,” he said. Among the top sellers were “holiday dressing” pieces and formalwear, which were the focus in this year’s holiday campaign. Elevated sportswear in sweaters and knits also did well. Despite the compressed calendar, Ohashi expects the strong performance to continue through December. “The stores that we recently expanded or are in new markets all performed very well,” he said, pointing to the larger Rockefeller Center store in New York City, as well as the Wisconsin Avenue unit in Washington, D.C., and Newbury Street in Boston. “They all performed well,” he said. “Newbury Street, in particular, has been on fire and four out of five people there have never shopped with us before.” As a result, Ohashi said he’s “not stressed going into the first quarter in terms of inventory,” and believes 2025 will also be strong for Brooks Brothers. Rhone had a strong holiday kickoff, too. “We had record-setting days in all channels,” said CEO Nate Checketts, who hit stores this weekend in Boston while his cofounder and brother Ben hit stores in Los Angeles. He said that in addition to strength in a new menswear product called the Coldspell Commuter Pant, which features a brushed flannel lining for warmth, Rhone was pleased with the performance of its recently launched women’s collection. “We saw higher ‘mixed baskets,’ of people buying both men’s and women’s,” Checketts said. Rhone stuck to its planned promotions of 30 percent off on orders of $300 or more. “We’ve run the same promotions for the last four years and we did the same this year,” he said. “Consumers are starting to come back in a stronger way after a year of uncertainty and a post-election cycle. It’s been a crazy couple of years.” But with the strength of Black Friday weekend as a backdrop he’s hopeful the momentum will be “pulled forward” to Cyber Monday and the remainder of the season. Bob Mitchell, co-CEO of Mitchells Stores, which operates luxury units under the Mitchells, Richards, Wilkes Bashford and Marios names on the East and West Coasts, said that despite Thanksgiving being a week later than last year, business in 2024 is very strong. “We just capped off a record, double-digit November and we’re off to a double-digit start for the holiday season,” he said. “Men’s has come on strong in the last few weeks,” particularly tailored clothing — especially sport coats — and sportswear. New spring deliveries have also started to check, he said. In women’s, “while ready-to-wear is up, we’re also seeing nice growth in handbags and jewelry, which has been the star.” Top luxury performers at Mitchells Stores were Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Loro Piana, Brioni, Canali, Akris and The Row while Fedeli and Baldessari did well in the mid-tier. Although reluctant to characterize the season as a success this early, Mitchell is upbeat. “The real numbers don’t start for us until 10 days before, so this could all be a mirage,” he said with a laugh. “But the customer is in a very good mood with how the [stock] market is performing and Bitcoin. So we expect it will be a good season.” Shopify merchants saw $5 billion in Black Friday sales this year, up 22 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago. Sales peaked at $4.6 million per minute at 12:01 p.m. EST on Friday and the average cart carried $111.12 worth of goods, driven by sales of tops, cosmetics, fitness and nutrition, pants and activewear. Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco and Miami were among the platform’s top cities for the day. As of Sunday morning — and headed toward Cyber Monday — Shopify was seeing about 12,500 orders and sales of more than $1.2 million per minute. Shopify powers more than 2 million online merchants. Target stores opened at 6 a.m. on Black Friday, but shoppers in some places started lining up as early as 11:30 the night before. The big-box store sought to draw consumers with Taylor Swift exclusives, including “The Official Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,” as well as versions of her album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” on CD and vinyl. As some locations sold out of at least part of their Taylor Swift goodies by 10 a.m., Target looked to steer the traffic to other parts of the store with discounts, including 40 percent off for fleece and 50 percent off for some women’s, kids and men’s looks. At Talbots, tops and sweaters were big sellers, due partially to a Black Friday special of $29.50 ”FestiviTees” for holiday-themed knit tops that generated 22,000 units in sales, according to a spokesperson. For gifting, sleepwear especially plaid flannel pajamas, were top sellers, along with down puffers and fashion vests. At Loft, consumers were favoring cozy styles including novelty and shimmery designs. Everyday crewneck sweaters, soft sweat sets, puffer coats, vests, and Lou & Grey loungewear were among the best sellers. While most retailers were closed Thanksgiving, Loft’s Times Square location was open and had customers waiting on line before the opening. Soma’s strong performers were “Cool Nights PJ sets,” loungewear, and bras, as well as a Soma printed tote bag gift with $100 purchase in stores only. Customers were “definitely ready” to shop for gifts and for themselves, according to the spokesperson. Shoppers at White House Black Market favored denim, sequins, faux fur, leather and novelty pants for work and holiday parties. Bustiers, embellished sweaters and party dresses were popular in red, purple, and black and white. Dick’s Sporting Goods flagged a handful of bestsellers, for example, in men’s, Nike’s full-zip Windrunner hoodie, On Cloud 5 shoes, and Carhartt’s K288 hoodie. In women’s, Nike’s Phoenix fleece oversize sweatshirt, Hoka’s women’s Clifton 9 running shoes and Calia soft scuba joggers, were cited. The weekend saw up to 30 percent off select Nike apparel, such as with Nike club hoodies, sweatshirts and joggers. Weather through the U.S. this past weekend was the coldest in more than 25 years, according to Evan Gold, executive vice president of Planalytics. And Black Friday was the coldest on a national basis since 2007, Gold added. Over the weekend, “New York City and a lot of other major markets in the Northeast were below freezing for the first time this season,” pushing demand for outerwear, sweaters, hats and gloves up 5 to 15 percent,” Gold said. New York City’s average temperature was 40 degrees versus 44 last year. Chicago averaged 23 degrees versus 33 last year, and Minneapolis was 16 degrees versus 27 degrees. Even Atlanta was colder, averaging 45 degrees versus 51 degrees last year. A few cities in the South Central and West were slightly warmer this weekend, with Los Angeles and Phoenix both averaging 65 degrees versus 62 last year. “It’s definitely going to be a colder December,” Gold said. “Last December was the warmest ever recorded.” New York City is expected to average 30 degrees, or 10 degrees colder than a year ago; Chicago will average in the low- to mid-20s, or about 18 degrees colder than last year. Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, said retailers started to “bluntly” lay out Black Friday deals in early November, when warmer weather was restraining sales of outerwear. Because the season started early — as has been the case for a number of years — she said price discounts ticked up only slightly on Black Friday. And all the holiday price promotions mean a little less given the impact of inflation across the economy. “That’s just going to make the consumers feel more selective,” Ramírez said. “I don’t think this is going to be a great holiday season in general for retail. I think it’s still going to be flat [when] you adjust inflation into it.” It’s a pricing dynamic that plays to the strengths of Walmart and the off-price channel, which Ramírez said would be winners. But value isn’t just about price. She said Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Hoka and On — brands that have been on the rise and are playing to a strong area of the market — are well positioned and are going into the holiday season with only minimal promotions. “The retail sector is being run much better than it has been in many years, in terms of inventory, in terms of price, in terms of promotions and even leaning into categories that make sense for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. In a good sign for fashion, “There is still that shift of people going more into office,” Ramírez said. “So apparel might have a better season.” According to a report on Black Friday from consulting firm Ankura, “Stores like Lululemon, Nike, Gap and Athleta were extremely busy; Columbia, North Face and Converse were also busy with deeper discounts.” Ankura also reported that Coach, Ugg and Michael Kors performed well, benefiting from discounts and consumer interest in luxury deals. Regarding department stores, Ankura reported, “While some anchor stores like Macy’s successfully attracted shoppers with organized and well-staffed environments, others such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom struggled with lower traffic and less effective promotional strategies. In general, those with clear and substantial discounts seemed to fare better.” Meanwhile, “Beauty stores ran aggressive promotions and had the traffic to prove it. Where they appeared to fail, was in the ability to restock the shelves during the day. By mid-day Sephora and Ulta Beauty shelves were stripped clean and have to imagine missed a lot of sales.” — With contributions from Lisa Lockwood, Evan Clark and Rosemary Feitelberg Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

At Talbots, tops and sweaters were big sellers, due partially to a Black Friday special of $29.50 ”FestiviTees” for holiday-themed knit tops that generated 22,000 units in sales, according to a spokesperson. For gifting, sleepwear especially plaid flannel pajamas, were top sellers, along with down puffers and fashion vests. At Loft, consumers were favoring cozy styles including novelty and shimmery designs. Everyday crewneck sweaters, soft sweat sets, puffer coats, vests, and Lou & Grey loungewear were among the best sellers. While most retailers were closed Thanksgiving, Loft’s Times Square location was open and had customers waiting on line before the opening. Soma’s strong performers were “Cool Nights PJ sets,” loungewear, and bras, as well as a Soma printed tote bag gift with $100 purchase in stores only. Customers were “definitely ready” to shop for gifts and for themselves, according to the spokesperson. Shoppers at White House Black Market favored denim, sequins, faux fur, leather and novelty pants for work and holiday parties. Bustiers, embellished sweaters and party dresses were popular in red, purple, and black and white. Dick’s Sporting Goods flagged a handful of bestsellers, for example, in men’s, Nike’s full-zip Windrunner hoodie, On Cloud 5 shoes, and Carhartt’s K288 hoodie. In women’s, Nike’s Phoenix fleece oversize sweatshirt, Hoka’s women’s Clifton 9 running shoes and Calia soft scuba joggers, were cited. The weekend saw up to 30 percent off select Nike apparel, such as with Nike club hoodies, sweatshirts and joggers. Weather through the U.S. this past weekend was the coldest in more than 25 years, according to Evan Gold, executive vice president of Planalytics. And Black Friday was the coldest on a national basis since 2007, Gold added. Over the weekend, “New York City and a lot of other major markets in the Northeast were below freezing for the first time this season,” pushing demand for outerwear, sweaters, hats and gloves up 5 to 15 percent,” Gold said. New York City’s average temperature was 40 degrees versus 44 last year. Chicago averaged 23 degrees versus 33 last year, and Minneapolis was 16 degrees versus 27 degrees. Even Atlanta was colder, averaging 45 degrees versus 51 degrees last year. A few cities in the South Central and West were slightly warmer this weekend, with Los Angeles and Phoenix both averaging 65 degrees versus 62 last year. “It’s definitely going to be a colder December,” Gold said. “Last December was the warmest ever recorded.” New York City is expected to average 30 degrees, or 10 degrees colder than a year ago; Chicago will average in the low- to mid-20s, or about 18 degrees colder than last year. Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, said retailers started to “bluntly” lay out Black Friday deals in early November, when warmer weather was restraining sales of outerwear. Because the season started early — as has been the case for a number of years — she said price discounts ticked up only slightly on Black Friday. And all the holiday price promotions mean a little less given the impact of inflation across the economy. “That’s just going to make the consumers feel more selective,” Ramírez said. “I don’t think this is going to be a great holiday season in general for retail. I think it’s still going to be flat [when] you adjust inflation into it.” It’s a pricing dynamic that plays to the strengths of Walmart and the off-price channel, which Ramírez said would be winners. But value isn’t just about price. She said Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Hoka and On — brands that have been on the rise and are playing to a strong area of the market — are well positioned and are going into the holiday season with only minimal promotions. “The retail sector is being run much better than it has been in many years, in terms of inventory, in terms of price, in terms of promotions and even leaning into categories that make sense for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. In a good sign for fashion, “There is still that shift of people going more into office,” Ramírez said. “So apparel might have a better season.” According to a report on Black Friday from consulting firm Ankura, “Stores like Lululemon, Nike, Gap and Athleta were extremely busy; Columbia, North Face and Converse were also busy with deeper discounts.” Ankura also reported that Coach, Ugg and Michael Kors performed well, benefiting from discounts and consumer interest in luxury deals. Regarding department stores, Ankura reported, “While some anchor stores like Macy’s successfully attracted shoppers with organized and well-staffed environments, others such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom struggled with lower traffic and less effective promotional strategies. In general, those with clear and substantial discounts seemed to fare better.” Meanwhile, “Beauty stores ran aggressive promotions and had the traffic to prove it. Where they appeared to fail, was in the ability to restock the shelves during the day. By mid-day Sephora and Ulta Beauty shelves were stripped clean and have to imagine missed a lot of sales.” — With contributions from Lisa Lockwood, Evan Clark and Rosemary Feitelberg Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is done. It's finished. The big sales bonanza is through for another year. Hopefully, you were able to bag a bargain or two from the most-wanted items on your shopping list. But it's not all a complete disaster if you missed the sales, as there are dozens of great Cyber Week deals still available – and I've rounded them up here. As a procrastinator myself and a seasoned deals editor, I've gone through today's remaining sales from Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more and hand-picked the best Cyber Monday deals that are still available and worth your money. The good news is that some excellent offers are still available, with record-low prices on TVs, kitchen gadgets, Apple Watches, robot vacuums, and smart home devices from brands like Sony, Samsung, Bissell, and Ninja. I've been combing through offers for weeks, and I'm only listing worthwhile deals on highly-rated products. You'll want to act fast though, as now the Cyber Monday sales are over I'm not sure how much longer these deals will be available. I'm sure more Christmas sales events will go live at retailers over the coming weeks but this might be your last opportunity of the year to find items discounted for such low prices. Are you looking for a cheap air fryer deal this Cyber Monday? Walmart is offering a massive 50% discount on the top-rated Chefman air fryer, bringing the price down to $50. The eight-quart air fryer features a basket divider, so you can separate food for dual cooking. The LG B4 is one of the most affordable OLED TVs on the market, and Best Buy has the 48-inch model on sale for $699.99. It was $100 less over Cyber Monday but this is still a fantastic price. Its self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade. Here it is, folks - the best deal yet on the latest Dell XPS 13. Complete with a brand-new Snapdragon X Elite chipset, this model is capable of not just exceptional day-to-day performance, but also battery life that's simply a cut-above what Windows laptops usually offer. Alongside superb specs, the latest XPS 13 also features a gorgeous lightweight design and a display that's perfect for both work and casual everyday use. This is an incredible price for a pair of wireless on-ear headphones – on sale for just $24.95 at Amazon right now. The JBL Tune 510BT features Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Streaming, so you can stream music and podcasts and take calls from your device, and you'll enjoy an impressive 40 hours of battery life. It's no t a model we've tested, but the JBL Tune 510BT have over 50,000 positive reviews on Amazon and are one of the best-selling headphones on the site. They also come with JBL's renowned Pure Bass sound. If you need something inexpensive and you need it now, it's hard to argue with this price tag… Apple's best-selling 10.2 iPad with 64GB of storage just dropped to $199 - a new record-low price. While the tablet is an older model, it still packs a 10.2-inch Retina display, and the A13 Bionic chip ensures excellent picture quality and superior performance. According to our Apple iPad 10.2 review, the entry-level tablet can do it all without issue, whether browsing the net, streaming media, doing light work, or playing games. At just $599 - Walmart is practically giving away Apple's MacBook Air. Not only is this an outstanding price for such a powerful laptop that still holds up great for 2024, but this could be the last chance to pick one up now that it's officially discontinued. Don't miss this incredible deal if you're looking for a great bang for the buck MacBook. This might be Amazon's best Cyber Monday deal - Apple's all-new Apple Watch 10 on sale for a new record-low price of $329. The Apple Watch 10 includes upgrades such as Apple's new S10 chipset, sleep apnea detection, depth gauge, and a new design featuring the most advanced display. I don't expect you'll find a better price this year, and this offer is in danger of being sold out. Get the best compact, single-serve blender for under $50 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. This is an ideal solution for your daily smoothie or protein shake. With its built-in handle and sippy cup lid, you'll be ready to make your favorite creation just before leaving the house. The Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus Deluxe by Breville is on sale for its cheapest price yet. This easy-to-use coffee maker supports multiple types of drinks and sizes, and you can brew these using dedicated recyclable Nespresso pods. The large removable water tank and compact size also add to its convenience. The Ninja Creami ice cream maker will surely be a Cyber Monday best-seller due to its popularity at recent holiday sales, and Walmart has the appliance down to a record-low price. You can make ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with a touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors. KitchenAid is a mainstay in the Bake Off tent and still the leader when it comes to high-quality stand mixers – but they do come with a hefty upfront cost. This healthy $120 discount on the premium Artisan model definitely takes the sting out, though. It comes with a stainless steel bowl and three attachments for mixing, kneading, and beating – everything the amateur or intermediate baker needs for the kitchen. Amazon's best-selling 43-inch 4-Series 4K smart TV is on sale for $229.99 - a new record-low price. It offers 4K HD resolution, smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, so you can use your voice to control your TV. Amazon's all-new Fire TV Omni QLED Series is a big step up in the otherwise cheap range of smart TVs. This set boasts premium features, including a QLED display, full-array local dimming, Dolby Vision IQ, and HDR10+ Adaptive support to deliver a high-quality picture for all-around viewing and gaming. A good overall buy for the budget-conscious who don't want to compromise on performance, especially now that it's down to a record-low price of $599.99. The Sony Bravia 8 is back at its lowest price yet ahead of Cyber Monday. As one of the best TVs for sound, it's an ideal choice if you want stellar sound without paying extra for a soundbar. Its OLED screen might not be the brightest of them all, but it still manages to rival the picture quality of its competitors using its brightness-boosting Bravia XP Processor. You can even use it with your gaming console of choice thanks to the two HDMI ports (out of four total) that support 4K/120 Hz gaming. If you're looking for a big-screen budget display, Best Buy has this 75-inch 4K TV on sale for $549.99. This entry-level TV from Samsung packs a solid 'Crystal' UHD 4K processor, an easy-to-use Tizen operating system, and full HDR support all for under $600. That's good value for money if you need a straightforward but capable display for your everyday viewing and media streaming. The Hisense U7N is an affordable mini-LED TV that provides serious bang for your buck, packing great features and performance into a budget package. It supports all HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, comes packed with gaming features, including 4K, 144Hz, and Dolby Vision gaming, and uses Google TV as its smart TV platform. This Cyber Monday deal takes the 75-inch model to under $1,000 – for a TV with this much to offer at this much size, this is a superb deal. Bissell portable carpet cleaners have become the breakout stars at holiday sales like Cyber Monday, and the top-rated Little Green model is currently on sale for $81.49. Perfect for pet owners and parents, the portable carpet cleaner can magically erase spills and stains on carpets, couches, auto interiors, and more. If you're on a budget but still want a high-end vacuum, Dyso's V8 Absolute is a fantastic option at just $299.99. Perfect for pet owners, the Dyson V8 features a de-tangling motor bar that works across hardwood floors and carpets and can transform into a handheld vac for quick and convenient clean-ups. Amazon has the top-rated iRobot Roomba robot vacuum on sale for $149.99 - the lowest price we've ever seen. Designed with homes with pets in mind, the Roomba features three levels of powerful suction for custom cleaning on carpets and hard floors and recharges itself when the battery is low. The top-rated Tineco cordless wet-dry vacuum mop combo is on sale for a record-low price of $99 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. The Tineco iFloor 2 vacuums and washes hard floors in one step, handling wet and dry messes in one sweep. Dyson cordless vacuums are always Cyber Monday best-sellers, and Walmart has the powerful V12 on sale for $399.99 - a record-low price. The V12 is Dyson's lightest cordless vacuum and features illumination technology that reveals invisible dust on hard floors so you don't leave anything behind. Here's a deal ahead of Cyber Monday on a Roomba robot vacuum mop combo, bringing the price down to its lowest ever. The j5 uses the iRobot Home App to create no-mop zones, so it will vacuum your hard floors while mopping at the same time but will avoid your carpet. Here's a huge $440 discount on a powerful and advanced robot vacuum from big-name brand iRobot. We praised its ability to pick up dirt from carpet and hard floors, and its self-charging feature in our iRobot Roomba J7 Plus review plus the convenient self-emptying bin. It is a bit noisy and sometimes struggles with larger debris but this is a good overall option. If you're looking for a budget laptop, Walmart's Cyber Monday sale has HP's 14-inch laptop for just $129 – an incredible price. For that money, you're getting an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of SSD, and up to 10 hours of battery life. It's hard to find a better cheap laptop deal in the early Cyber Monday sales than this Inspiron 15. It's nothing fancy, but this machine manages to pack in both a powerful Ryzen 5 chipset and a sizeable 512GB SSD in for just $300 - that's not bad to say the least. While you're only getting 8GB of RAM here, this is still a good choice if you're just looking for a cost-effective machine to cover the basics. This is the best discount I've seen on the new Microsoft Surface Pro – and it's a tempting buy after we were super-impressed in our Surface Pro 11 review. This version boasts a gorgeous 13-inch PixelSense Flow OLED display at 2880 x 1920 resolution so it looks sharp and crisp with some vibrant colors and deep blacks. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon X Plus processor ensures excellent battery life and combines well with its many AI features to simplify your life. There’s also 16GB of memory and 512GB of SSD storage which will ensure speedy performance and enough storage space for your essential files and applications. Dell's Cyber Monday deals on the higher-end XPS 13 models are also amazing this week. Take this Ultra 7 configuration, for example, a massive $400 price cut makes this one a lot easier on the pocket. While I wouldn't immediately recommend a machine with 32GB of RAM to everyone (it's overkill for most), this is a great choice for a professional-grade laptop. The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about $100 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people, exactly because you can find them at a price like this during major sales such as Cyber Monday. The Bose QuietComfort headphones are the manufacturer's mid-range noise-cancelling cans and have dropped to a record-low price in this deal ahead of Cyber Monday. On top of the manufacturer's excellent ANC to block out unwanted noise, you get high-fidelity audio and an EQ control to customize bass, mid-range, and treble. The QuietComfort lasts up to 24 hours on one charge and can get back 2.5 hours of playtime in 15 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 are a refinement of the previous model with AirPods-like ear sticks, active noise cancellation, a 11mm driver, and AI-powered features like a voice-call booster and a translation tool – providing you have a modern Samsung phone. They look and feel good in your ears too with up to 5 hours of battery life with ANC on, making them good for your commute or workout. And now you can get them for as little as $39.99 with a trade-in, that's a bargain. Quite simply the best in Sony's class-leading wireless over-ear lineup. The older XM4 headphones were outstanding, the XM3 cans before it were excellent, and it'll come as little surprise to know that Sony's XM5 proposition is also incredibly hard to beat – especially with a whopping 25% off, equalling their lowest-ever price! They don't fold up like the XM4 but, as a quick glance at our Sony WH-100XM5 review proves, there's not much else to pick fault with. Looking to buy a smart speaker for a small space? Amazon's Cyber Monday deals include the all-new Echo Pop for just $17.99 - the cheapest Echo device you can buy right now. For that money, you're getting a compact smart speaker with Alexa built-in, so you can play music, ask questions, and check the weather completely hands-free. If you're looking for more robust sound, Amazon's Cyber Monday deals also include the Echo Dot for its lowest price. Amazon's best-selling smart speaker offers an improved audio experience, plus a new temperature sensor and all the handy features from Alexa, like playing music, answering questions, and checking the weather completely hands-free. Amazon's best-selling Echo Show 5 is on sale for a whopping 50% discount. The 2023 Echo Show 5 features a compact 5.5-inch display but packs impressive sound with deeper bass and clearer vocals. With Amazon Alexa, you can listen to podcasts, movies, music, and more. If you're after the best-value PS5 Slim console as well as the best-value bundle, then this Fortnite Cobalt Star listing at Walmart is the way to go. There have been savings galore for the Xbox Series X Digital Edition this Black Friday. And rightly so, as I feel its retail price is a touch on the pricey side given the lack of a disc drive. It's certainly more compelling below that $400 mark. Sadly there's no bundle here, but still a decent saving for the console itself. With fast performance for a smartwatch and a sleek design, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is instantly likeable. And now you can save up to $200 when you trade in your current device – alongside a flat $60 discount. Samsung's latest wearable provides more precise heart rate tracking than previous models, while it also helps you monitor how stressed you are and how well you’re sleeping. Think of it as your personal assistant on your wrist and you’re not far off. It even suggests how to respond to messages and notifications. Last year's best Fitbit Inspire 3 deal has returned to its lowest-ever price of $69.95, $30/30% off the usual list price of $99.95. Available in both colors, you'll get 24/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and notifications from your communication apps. Get a massive $60 off the $160 Fitbit Charge 6 for a return to the lowest-ever price of $99.95. The ergonomic band and slender display provide sleep monitoring, multisport tracking, ECG, GPS, contactless payments, and more. ^ Back to all deals I'm TechRadar's lead for US deals and TV discounts, and I've been doing this for the last six years. I have a lot more experience than that, though – I've worked in ecommerce for 11 years. No one has combed through more deals than me, I promise you. Welcome to this afternoon's live coverage of all the best Cyber Monday deals still available. While there are just hours left until most offers expire, there are plenty of deals to shop from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.I'll highlight all the top offers on tech gadgets, appliances, and beauty items from brands like Apple, Samsung, Bissell, Dyson, Sony, and Keurig. The TechRadar team has also reviewed most of the products listed in the guide so we can help you find the right product at the lowest price possible. Remember that Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart's Cyber Monday sales end tonight, and this might be your last chance to score your dream purchase at a record-low price. If you're looking for the cheapest Cyber Monday OLED TV deal, Best Buy has LG's excellent 48-inch B4 OLED TV on sale for $599.99 - an incredible price for an OLED display.LG's B4 self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade.LG 48-inch B4 OLED TV: was $1,499.99 now $599.99 at Best Buy I already own the third-generation Echo Dot and can't imagine life without it. The smart speaker plays music, answers any question I throw at it, and tells me the weather forecast - all I have to do is ask Alexa. The compact Echo Pop is Amazon's latest smart speaker. It shares all the same features I love about the Echo Dot but in a more compact design. The best part? Amazon's Cyber Monday sale has included a free Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb for just $17.99 - a massive 66% discount. Echo Pop + Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb: was $39.99 now $17.99 at Amazon This would make a GREAT stocking stuffer idea – the wildly popular Apple AirTag 4-pack is on sale for its lowest price yet.The Apple AirTag is a handy Bluetooth location-tracking device that pairs with your iPhone. If you're like me and tend to misplace your keys or wallet, just attach the AirTag to anything you don't want to lose, and your iPhone will locate the item with Precision Finding technology.Apple AirTag (4-pack): was $99 now $69.99 at Amazon There's one Cyber Monday deal ending tonight that you need to see above the rest. It's this offer on Hulu that's already proved tremendously popular over the last few days. And, honestly, I can see why. You can pay just $0.99 per month for a Hulu subscription with ads, which saves you almost $100 over a year's membership. There's also an option to bundle it with Disney Plus for a measly $2.99 a month – another huge bargain for both streaming services. This one ends today, though, so it's definitely one I'd pull the trigger on as soon as possible. ENDS TONIGHT – Get Hulu for $0.99 per month There were a lot of disappointed faces in the TechRadar office when we saw the Kindle deals over Amazon Prime Day and the Prime Big Deal Days sale. A lot of us – and I'm sure many of you too – pinned a lot of hopes on big discounts during those Amazon-exclusive sales. And there wasn't much to be excited about at all. At least there's been some improvement in the Cyber Monday sales, with both the latest Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite getting their first-ever price cuts. Sure, both ereaders are nowhere near as cheap as I've seen previous versions in the past, but these are still decent offers for the new and improved models with bigger screens and longer battery life. I'm confident in saying these will likely be the best offers we see until at least July next year, so don't miss your chance to get a discount before the Amazon Cyber Monday sale ends later tonight. Kindle: was $109.99 now $84.99 at AmazonKindle Paperwhite: was $159.99 now $129.99 at Amazon This little appliance has been on my wish list to help me keep my New Year's resolution of keeping my car clean.

The thinnest Apple Watch ever and the one with the biggest display is down to a record-low price this Cyber Monday. The 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 is just $329 (originally $399), and the larger 46mm is only $359 (originally $429). Both of these come in several shades, including a polished Jet Black finish, and feature an Always-On display that gets plenty bright. Out of the box, you'll find the latest version of watchOS 11 with the new smart stack. If you've been waiting to score the best Apple Watch for most folks, now's the time. Apple Watch Series 10 42mm (GPS): was $399 now $329 at Amazon Apple Watch Series 10 46mm (GPS): was $429 now $359 at Amazon This might be the best Cyber Monday TV deal I've spotted. The LG C4 is a successor to last year's LG C3 OLED, which TechRadar highly praised and is ranked in our best TV guide. Upgrades to the LG C4 include an improved picture experience with boosted brightness, a 144hz refresh rate, and LG's latest Alpha 9 AI chip.Today's deal from Amazon brings the price of this 42-inch model down to $896.99 - that's a new record-low price and an incredible deal for an OLED display.LG's 42-inch C4 OLED TV: was $1,499.99 now $896.99 at Amazon The Bissell Little Green portable carpet cleaner is an appliance I already own and can't live without, thanks to my two little messy boys.

The Ninja Creami allows you to whip up your own ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with a touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors. Ninja Creami ice cream maker: was $199 now $149 at Walmart I've had my eye on this compact indoor security camera since its release, and now that it's on sale for just $19.99, it feels like a no-brainer. The Blink Mini 2 features night vision and two-way audio so you can hear and speak to visitors, and it will alert your smartphone when motion is detected. Blink Mini 2: was $39.99 now $19.99 at Amazon I always include Crest's 3D Whitestrips in my favorite Cyber Monday deals, and it's one of my yearly purchases. They're expensive and rarely on sale, so Cyber Monday is the perfect opportunity to find them on sale. You get 48 whitening strips plus a bonus pair of one-hour express strips to have a whiter smile in no time.Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects: was $45.99 now $27.99 at Amazon Gamers rejoice!

You can also access any PS5-capable titles, plus select tiles for previous consoles. This way, you can play your Sony favorites and get the mighty DualSense Controller included in the box.PS5 Slim Digital Edition: was $499.99 now $424 at Walmart It's hard not to recommend Sony's excellent WH-1000XM5, which are some of the best over-ear headphones you can buy. The previous model was already outstanding, but the XM5 are even better. We generally recommend the XM4 instead, because the difference is not that great given the higher price, but today's Cyber Monday deal at Amazon makes it a harder decision, with a whopping 25% off the newer model. If you do want to go for the XM4 instead, they're a full $100 cheaper, also at Amazon. Tough choices await!Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $298 at Amazon Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $198 at Amazon This is the best price you'll find on an Apple MacBook, and I'm shocked it's still in stock.

Title: I'd leave the Xbox controller on its shelf this Cyber Monday and buy this $35 gamepad instead

Do you really need a wireless controller? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The GameSir G7 SE is meant to be a budget controller that you can get for cheap, but I don't think it's supposed to be better than the official gamepad that comes in your Xbox's box. GameSir clearly didn't understand that assignment though, because although it has a cutesie look and an unassuming face, it's a fully-fledged pro controller for Xbox and PC that I'd easily recommend over Microsoft's version. It's also blissfully cheap thanks to Cyber Monday sales at the moment. Reduced from its $45 regular price, it's down to $35.99 at Amazon. That saving applies to all of its colorways, including the white, eggshell model I tested for review, as well as the Blue, Orange, and Purple versions that have been released since. Rather annoyingly, this Cyber Monday Xbox deal is a Prime exclusive, but luckily there's an offer on the retail page to take out a 30-day free trial if you aren't already a member. I've spotted the G7 SE drop down to this price a few times now, and it's always one I'd recommend to people looking for a spare controller to throw into their rotation because there's amazing value to be had from it. GameSir G7 SE | $44.99 $35.99 at AmazonSave $10 - A $10 reduction on an already very affordable controller is never a bad thing, and for your money here, you get two back buttons, audio controls, deadzone customization, and great ergonomics. Buy it if: ✅ You want a controller with back buttons✅ You don't mind a wired connection✅ You like a smaller-feeling controller Don't buy it if: ❌ You prefer larger, heavier controllers❌ You want color options GameSir doesn't provide UK: £39 at Amazon Whether you're a PC gamer looking for a controller to occasionally use in games that require one, or you're an Xbox player needing something up a level from the stock Wireless controller, the GameSir G7 SE is a great option. It's one of the more affordable Xbox pro controllers out there today, but it's still one of the first I'll look for when it comes to the likes of Black Friday and Prime Day because its features give even the expensive ones a run for their money. Two back buttons can make a huge difference after you spend a bit of time getting used to them. They mean you don't have to rely on quick thumb movements for all of your in-game functions, and in first-person games you don't need to take your thumbs off the sticks as much, resulting in better aim and movement. The back buttons here are placed beautifully so you don't need to adjust your natural grip to press them - they fall right under your middle fingers. GameSir was also one of the first brands to really embrace the anti-stick drift movement by adopting Hall Sensor thumbsticks in all of its products. If you've been burned by one too many cheap gamepads that have broken down over time, this is a brand I think you really need to know about. I've tested its best PC controllers over hundreds of hours at this point, and they're some of the most reliable I've ever used. The Windows app you can use to customize their deadzones, button mapping, and more is really impressive too. Of course, the one drawback to this controller is that it came out before Xbox relaxed its licensing parameters, and as a result, it can only work with your PC or Xbox with a wired connection. There is a 3m cable in the box here, but if that's going to be a dealbreaker, maybe check out one of the other best Xbox Series X controllers. There are more deals where that came from. Check out some Cyber Monday gaming PC deals, Cyber Monday Meta Quest deals, and Cyber Monday gaming chair deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jump straight to the deals you want...1. Quick links2. PCG's top products3. Today's top deals4. Deal hubs5. Live updates That's it, Black Friday is well and truly done. But just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in to give you peak Cyber Monday gaming deals realness. Sure, we've got a guide going over the full range of the best Cyber Monday PC gaming deals, but I'm here to give you that personal touch, and highlight the deals as they pop up and give you the cream of the crop. Crops have cream, right? Like, oats have milk. I digress. As Cyber Monday begins properly today, and Cyber Week goes on beyond that, we've already seen a bunch of last week's deals either go out of stock or rise to the point where we no longer recommend them. BUT that's not to say that they won't be back. What we often see is that specific Black Friday deals that might have gone 'off sale' over the weekend get picked up again on Cyber Monday and sold as fresh deals. But, y'know, with the same price. There will also be some genuinely fresh deals cropping up over the next few days as Cyber Week cracks on. Already I've found a couple of good gaming laptops and gaming PCs that weren't around just a few days ago. There are also some actually great handheld gaming PC deals, too. So, if you've been itching to get on the mobile gaming bandwagon there literally has never been a better time. So, if you're in the mood to either treat yourself, or make sure you get your Christmas shopping done early, and with a smattering of solid discounts to make your money go further, stay with me as I'm going to keep on hunting out the best tech deals this Cyber Week and posting them here. We'll also be regularly updating our Cyber Monday deal hubs throughout this time, but this is where I want to highlight here my absolute favorite PC gaming deals. But why me? Well, I've been doing this a long time. Way before Black Friday or Cyber Monday were fashionable—I mean, look, all the cool kids are doing it now—I was casting around to find you lovely people the best deals, and I've also been a technology journalist for over 19 years now so I've got a pretty good idea of what's good, what's not, and what's just some retailer or manufacturer trying to make a fast buck out of old stock. As well as the best deals, we're also tracking down the best prices on the key products from our full suite of product buying guides. We maintain those guides throughout the year, completely based on products we have reviewed ourselves and can absolutely stand by their continued excellence. Dave's been doing the PC hardware dance since back in 2005, and building gaming PCs since the '90s. You know, when it was difficult. In his time he's tested every type of PC component, peripheral, and accessory you can imagine, and probably some you can't. That makes him perfectly placed to recommend the best deals, and the ones you need to steer clear of this Black Friday. Nvidia GeForce-powered gaming PCs AMD Radeon-powered gaming PCs Gaming laptop deals Graphics card deals Gaming monitor deals 1. Yeyian Tanto | Intel Core i5 13400F | RTX 4070 Super | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Newegg (save $400)Yeyian has a stellar deal on an RTX 4070 Super machine here. We've seen slightly cheaper versions on sale, but this one at least does have proper DDR5 memory, making the motherboard at least nominally upgradeable to a more modern spec. It does make a bit of an odd combo with the Core i5 here, though for straightforward gaming performance, it shouldn't prove any issue and deliver high frame rates. 2. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 (sold out) | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) 3. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. 4. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) 5. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 6. MSI Vector 16 HX | RTX 4080 | Core i9 14900HX | 16-inch | 1600p | 240 Hz | 1 TB SSD | 32 GB RAM | $2,099 $1,849 at B&H (save $250)Of the two MSI Vector machines we've highlighted here, I'd rather this one. It has a newer, more powerful CPU, a better screen resolution and refresh rate for an RTX 4080, and 32 GB of RAM. Altogether, that makes for a pretty sweet package and an upgrade worth the extra $100 over the cheapest RTX 4080 laptop we've found so far. Price check: Microcenter $1,999.99 7. ASRock Phantom Gaming | 27-inch | 1080p | 165 Hz | IPS | $179.99 $99.77 at Newegg (save $79.22)ASRock has become a favorite of ours around here over busy shopping periods. These screens always seem to be on offer, and from the one we've used (read our review) they're good value for the money, too. You can't really complain with this 165Hz panel for just under $100. 8. HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $125.99 at Amazon (save $74)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming goodness on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $149.99 | Newegg $144.99 9. ASRock Challenger RX 7800 XT | 16 GB GDDR6 | 3,840 shaders | 2,475 MHz boost | $469.99 $449.99 at Newegg (save $20)At this price point, the best card used to be the RX 6800 XT but these days we have deals like this one, where the 7800 XT has the same price tag. It's only a little bit faster than the card it's replaced, but you're still getting a lotta GPU for the money. RX 7800 XT price check: | Best Buy $469.99 | Amazon $449.99 10. LG UltraGear 34GP63A-B | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $399.99 $239.99 at Amazon (save $160)At its current price, this LG ultrawide is a genuine bargain. By comparison, Alienware's fancy QD-OLED 34-inch panel is around $800 even on sale. This LG matches its size, resolution, aspect ratio and refresh rate for less than one-third of the price, although of course, it is a VA panel, not an OLED. It's also not the brightest gaming monitor ever, but it is a very good deal. Price check: LG $239.99 The number of sub-$200 gaming monitors, that are both high refresh rate and with a 1440p native resolution is nuts. That used to be the preserve of much more expensive screens, but thanks to the Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals going down right now, you're getting big brand monitors on sale for often actually less than $150. Now, that's not exactly throw away money, but it's now a price where you could probably suck it up for the extra sharpness and Windows screen real estate you get with a 2560 x 1440 screen. And these are either IPS or VA panels, too, like actually good displays. These are five of the best still around: Acer KA272U | 27-inch | 1440p | 100 Hz | IPS | $199.99 $139.99 at Best Buy (save $60)If you're on the tightest of budgets, this will get you a decently sized 1440p monitor for a real bargain price. It's even got a higher-than-60 Hz refresh rate. Okay, 100 Hz isn't spectacular, but it is still notably smoother than 60 Hz. It's also not the brightest screen, rated at 250 nits peak, but the compromises will have to come in somewhere. If you want something brighter, the $145 ASRock below is a true winner. ASRock Phantom PG27Q15R2A | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | $239.99 $142.77 at Newegg (save $97.22)ASRock's gaming monitors are always so darned cheap—we love them for that. This 1440p panel offers resolution and a rapid refresh rate for a potent PC gaming combo, though the built-in Wi-Fi antenna helps it stand out from the crowd. That's hardly essential, but could come in use for some. Acer Nitro ED270U | 27-inch | 1440p | 170 Hz | VA | $249.99 $149.99 at Newegg (save $100)This is one of the best deals on a 1440p gaming monitor we've seen so far. A respectable brand and a respectable spec, although it might be worth holding out for an IPS panel. Still, a good price on a great little screen. Price check: Amazon $184.10 Acer Nitro XV271U M3bmiiprx | 27-inch | 1440p | 180 Hz | IPS | $289.99 $169.99 at Amazon (save $120)This Acer monitor is a steal for all you prospective competitive gamers, hitting a high refresh rate and low response time sweet spot (0.5-1 ms gray-to-gray). It's the same price as the Odyssey G5 below but is better for those of you who prefer an IPS panel to a VA. Price check: Newegg $251 Samsung Odyssey G5 G55C | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $299.00 $195.99 at Newegg (save $104)This monitor was already a great deal at its previous price. Now, for well under $200 it's a steal. Samsung has form when it comes to getting VA panels to achieve good response. Put simply, Samsung VA panels are the quickest. I'm going to say that, for my Cyber Monday bingo, I did not have two actually pretty damned good RTX 4070 gaming laptops on sale for less than $880. Okay, they're only a solid cent under that price, but still, that is an unprecedented pricetag for any gaming laptop sporting this GPU. The only issue with either machine is that they are sporting a single 512 GB SSD which is guaranteed to get filled with games as fast as you can download them. At the moment 1 TB is kinda the minimum we'd want as our boot drives, but both of these impressive budget machines come with spare M.2 slots in the back of them, making an SSD upgrade as easy as it could possibly be. If it's my money, I think I'd be more tempted by the HP machine with its more up-to-date AMD Ryzen CPU. That's a proper Zen 4 chip in there, rather than the slightly odd Zen 3.5+ offering in the Lenovo. But still, I really like the Lenovo chassis and keyboard, so it's still a bit of a toss-up. Both are going to perform well in games, that's for sure. HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $879.99 at Best Buy (save $520)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. Do you know what I'm obsessed with when it comes to gaming laptops? Inches. Namely 14 of the old imperial measurements. That's right, I frickin' love a 14-inch gaming laptop. Now, I am a man of a certain age, with fading eyes, but even then I think that size of laptop and laptop screen are the perfect scale for a genuine mobile gaming machine. The new 16-inch machines maybe aren't that much bigger, but for me they're still just getting on for that too big for travelling thing. A 14-incher, however, is much more easily used on plane's tray table, much better for balancing on your knees when you're sat on the floor in a crowded departure lounge, or even just to sit on a wee cafe table. And you can get serious performance in that slight form factor now, and there are some decent Cyber Monday 14-inch gaming laptop deals. The first thing to note is that there is absolutely a price premium for this smaller laptop form factor, so if that is absolutely your primary concern there are far cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming laptops around. Because, yes, these machines are rather pricey in the context of RTX 4060 laptops, in fact you can find several RTX 4070 notebooks for less. But if you're after the form factor, these are the best 14-inch deals going. Omen Transcend 14 | RTX 4060 | Core Ultra 7 155H | 14-inch | 2880 x 1800 | OLED | 512 GB SSD | 16 GB RAM | $1,729.99 $1,129.99 at HP (save $600)This is a very specific type of laptop for a very specific type of person, but if you are that person, there's a good saving to be had. It's a teeny tiny little device with an RTX 4060 and one of Intel's Meteor Lake chips inside it. It has a more sleek chassis than most on this list, though that does come with a higher fee. It's basically RTX 4070 money for an RTX 4060. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen 9 8945HS | 16 GB LPDDR5X | 1 TB SSD | 1800p | OLED | 120 Hz | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Best Buy (save $400)You're really paying for the form factor here, as you might have noticed this laptop is surrounded by similarly price machines with RTX 4070s in them. Though the G14 is a wonderfully compact machine with a gorgeous OLED and all-metal chassis. It's a premium pick—there's a reason they're competing with Razer's Blade laptops—and the premium price can only be avoided so much. Still, $400 off isn't bad. Asus TUF A14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen AI HX 370 | 14-inch | 16 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $1,499 $1,349 at Walmart (save $150)The TUF A14 was a bit of a surprise package to arrive in the PCG office this year, and I ended up a big fan in my review of it. It's a big upgrade on the previous generation of 14-inch, taking many of the design notes from the premium Zephyrus range, but doing so in a more affordable form. It's still a little pricey for an RTX 4060 laptop if that's all you're after, but for a compact 14-inch version with AMD's latest, even a small discount is decent. Keep it clean, people. You're desktop, I mean. I am, however, a man living in a glass house lobbing rocks about because if you were to glimpse my office space in PC Gamer Towers it would shock and disappoint you. It's gross. And I could probably do with at three of the five different PC cleaning goodies that our Jess has tracked down this Cyber Monday. SNACTIV PRO Finger Chopsticks | 4.21 inches | Glow in the dark | Dishwasher safe | $19.99 $15.79 at Amazon (save $4.20)If regular chopsticks require just a wee bit too much coordination for you—no judgment here—this tweezer tool that slips between your knuckles may be the perfect alternative utensil for eating your crumbly snack of choice. Tassmpitor Laptop and Keyboard Cleaning Kit | Cleaning brushes | Lens cleaner pen | Keycap puller | Refillable screen cleaning spray | $15.99 $12.27 at Amazon (save $3.72)Compact and portable, this cleaning kit has everything you need to keep your keyboard from getting crusty. With multiple, dainty little tools, there's nowhere to hide for dust, dirt, or crumbs. Compressed Air Duster & Mini Vacuum Keyboard Cleaner | Cordless | Range of detachable nozzles | $27.99 $21.99 at Newegg (same $6)This portable, handheld vacuum cleaner can do so much more than keep your keyboard free of crumbs. When sucking up dirt just won't suffice, the air vent on the back of the device lets you switch up your cleaning tactics. Colorcoral Universal Dust Cleaner Gel | Yellow | Lemon scent fragrance | No rinse necessary | Reusable | $11.99 $5.91 at Amazon (save $6.08)When a brush or vacuum just won't do, you'll need something that can take hold of the situation with an adhesive grip. Make no mistake, this will root out the toughest of dust bunnies from your hardware. VCOM RGB Gaming Headphones Stand | Black | 2 USB Type-A ports, 1 USB Type-C port | RGB lighting | 10 light modes | $21.99 $18.04 at Amazon (save $3.95)Tidy up your desk setup with this all-in-one stand. Stack your gaming headset, gamepads or other controllers, and more all on this snazzy rack with RGB lighting. There are still a ton of great Cyber Monday gaming PC deals alive out there. And our Andy has been running the rule over what's left and in his wisdom he's calling out these as the five best gaming PC deals still going strong today. CyberPowerPC Gamer Master | Ryzen 5 5500 | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR4 | 1 TB SSD | $879.99 $749.99 at Best Buy (save $130)This may be sporting a budget processor from a couple of AMD generations ago, but in combination with that RTX 4060 it should still be a mean lean machine for 1080p gaming—with even the odd dollop of 1440p thanks to DLSS 3. You're also getting a full 1 TB SSD and 16 GB of, admittedly DDR4, memory into the bargain. The AM4 platform may be old now, but it still has upgrade legs, and you could eventually stick a Ryzen 7 5700X3D in there to really beef up the gaming performance for not a lot of cash. Yeyian Tanto | Ryzen 5 7500F | RTX 4060 Ti | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,299 $949.99 at Newegg (save $350)This is the cheapest RTX 4060 Ti build around at the moment, and is actually a pretty decent rig. There are other options with low-end Core i5 chips, but this Zen 4 F-series CPU comes with six cores and 12 threads, and sits in an AM5 motherboard which gives it an upgrade path. The board is pretty low-spec however, so will likely only have space for the one SSD, but what you get is a full 1 TB. And that 16 GB of DDR5-5600 is pretty quick, too. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 14400F | RTX 4070 | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599 $1,149.99 at Newegg (save $350)RTX 4070 machines can vary in price and specification quite significantly, but here you're getting that great 1440p GPU (with even some 4K credentials thanks to DLSS 3), a nice and speedy Core i5 paired with a proper 32 GB dose of DDR5 RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. That's a really great selection of hardware that makes it a great gaming rig for more like budget prices. iBuyPower RDY Slate | Core i7 14700KF | RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with checkout code CYBERMONDAY)Yes, you can find slightly cheaper RTX 4070 Super builds right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this particular beastie. With this machine, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a particularly fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. Yeyian Gaming PC | Core i7 13700F | RTX 4080 | 32 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $2,299.99 $1,999.99 at Newegg (save $300)While this is the old RTX 4080 and not the Super variant, it's got virtually identical performance, so this machine's still a mighty powerful rig for less than $2,000. The Core i7 CPU is a fine pairing for the GPU, and is backed up by 32 GB of relatively speedy DDR5 memory. The 1 TB SSD is the bare minimum amount of storage you'd expect to see at this price, but this is still an excellent gaming PC for the money. Look at it. JUST LOOK AT IT! Now, that's a controller. Seriously, this 8BitDo pad is outstanding. Not even just for the fact that it's only $25 right now in the Cyber Monday sales, but because of what you get in it. We're talking Hall effect sticks, so no more drift, AND Hall effect triggers, too. Normally we find it hard to look past the stock controllers from Microsoft and Sony for a pad recommendation; they're just so well built and genuinely affordable. But the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C has everything they do, and more. Our Jacob has been testing it recently for a review and has become rather enamoured with the controller. 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless | Mint | $29.99 $25.49 (save $4.50 at Amazon)We've already raved about Hall Effect joysticks and how they spell the end for the dreaded stick drift. In this wireless gaming controller, they're a welcome feature, as are the extra bumper buttons. Oh, and that's a seriously cheap price tag for a quality product, of course. Which is the main reason to pick one up: it feels very premium for the price. Just a good old fashioned great PC for a great price. There are cheaper RTX 4070 Super machines, but this one comes with a spec so well rounded that you will not be able to find a tangible flaw in this build. Normally we will complain about a miserly 1 TB of SSD storage space in a $1,400 gaming PC, but not here, because iBuyPower has jammed a full 2 TB drive in there. We won't complain about the memory so much, but we do expect at least 16 GB of RAM in our modern gaming PCs. Here iBuyPower has gone over and above again, with 32 GB of the good stuff in there. And I mean good stuff, too, because it's quick 6000 MT/s DDR5, which is just about the sweet spot for that Intel Core i7 CPU. It's a quality spec, for a quality machine. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code CYBERMONDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of speedy RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. The Lemokey G1 is an excellent, affordable wireless gaming mouse, now made even more affordable thanks to the Cyber Monday deals. It's accurate, lightweight, and feels good in the hand. In fact, I think I might prefer it to the DeathAdder V3 Pro which I use every day, and which now feels rather chunky in my soft gamer hands. With the Lemokey G1 at just $52 at Amazon you're getting a serious wireless gaming mouse for the money. With key specs, such as the 30K DPI, and 750 IPS tracking, it's a great mouse for gaming. Though I would ask you to ignore the 8K polling rate stuff; that's of dubious benefit at the best of times, and here it doesn't really work brilliantly and will just drain the battery more than is really necessary. Lemokey G1 | Wireless | 30,000 DPI | 55 g | $74.99 $52.49 at Amazon (save $22.50)Lemokey is better known for its gaming keyboards I'll wager, as the gaming subsidiary of Keychron, but it also makes great, affordable gaming mice, too. I recently reviewed the G1, and came away very impressed, even over the DeathAdder V3 Pro I use daily. The Lemokey is lighter and just feels more rapid. It's also a lot more affordable, espeically at this price. Just don't get too carried away with its promises of 8K polling—that just drains battery and performs a bit weirdly. Price check: Lemokey: $62.10 No rebate, no Prime members only shenanigans, just the cheapest price we've seen the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Super retailing for ever. Now, granted it's not a spectacular discount in real terms—while the MSI MSRP is down as $839.99, the standard MSRP was $799.99—this is still the most affordable the card has been. In the run up to the new GeForce generation dropping in January you might question spending even the $740 the MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super is going for on Amazon. That is a valid concern, and if you're happy with your current setup and reckon you'd fine waiting until at least the middle of 2025 to upgrade, then by all means wait and see what launches in that price bracket, and wait for it to come back into stock after the first flush of RTX 50-series GPUs get swallowed up. But if you're after a new graphics card today, and one that is pretty damned powerful but not too punitively priced, then the RTX 4070 Ti Super—dumb name and all—is a worthy purchase. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 Boo, the most affordable 4K OLED gaming monitor, that MSI one that was on sale for $700 over the past week, has lost its discount. Now that one is back up to $867 at Amazon. Nightmare. Well, not too much of a nightmare because the 240 Hz version of that MSI OLED, the MSI MAG 321UPX is still on sale for less, for $800 at Amazon. It sucks that it's $100 more than the Black Friday deal, but is still a great price for a 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor that was once around the $1,000 mark. In fact, most of the other 4K OLEDs using the same 32-inch panel are still retailing for over $1,000, so this still represents a good Cyber Monday gaming monitor deal. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) Wireless gaming mice are grand, but largely a nice-to-have luxury. Wireless gaming keyboards are... well, IMO kinda pointless at best and a pain in the butt at worst. But wireless gaming headsets, that's a PC peripheral that I would say was made for low latency wireless protocols. Though it must be said a good wireless mouse is more affordable today than ever before. But I digress. The thing is, whether you think the cable on a mouse is unsightly, unless it's frustratingly stiff and gets in the way while you're playing it will have no material effect on the performance of the mouse. The same goes with keyboards, though it's actually even less useful as you keyboard, ideally, shouldn't be moving around as you type, negating any freedom-of-movement benefit from being wireless. But a wired gaming headset tethering your head to your PC is an abomination. Not only are you guaranteed at some point to stand up from desk while wearing your headset and either yank the cable out, bend the plug, or tip over your PC, but you will also hear that cable. You know that sound when the cable's rubbing against your clothes as you move your head around, and it translates into the ear cups strapped to your head? Yeah, you don't get any of that with a wireless headset. So, I'm firmly in the pro wireless headset corner, and this Cyber Monday there are deals on the good, better, best cable-free cans that we recommend as the best wireless gaming headsets. Corsair HS55 Wireless Core | 50 mm drivers | 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz | Closed-back | 2.4 GHz + Bluetooth | $99.99 $54.99 at Newegg (save $45)This is the Core version of our best budget wireless gaming headset, and it's on sale for a price that actually undercuts the wired version right now. The only difference with this Core version and the standard headset is that this one doesn't have iCUE support... which I don't think anyone outside of Corsair is going to miss. Price check: Amazon $54.99 HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $124.13 at Amazon (save $75.86)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $125.99 | Newegg $144.99 Audeze Maxwell | 90mm planar magnetic drivers | 10 Hz to 50,000 Hz | Wireless | $299.99 $267.73 at Amazon (save $32.28)Well, here it is. The ultimate in wireless audiophile gaming headsets, the Audeze Maxwell makes use of a set of planar magnetic drivers to deliver audio quality that makes reviewers gush the world over. It's a bit heavy, and the software isn't great, but otherwise, this is a symphony of gaming headset luxury—as we found in our 93% review. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 From a pure price per gigabyte metric, these are the best-value SSDs around right now. Now, that doesn't mean they are the absolute best in their capacity class—there are faster drives for not a lot more cash in our regularly updated best Cyber Monday SSD deals page, such as the 1 TB Nextorage NEM-PAB which is up there with the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives, for just $68 at Newegg ($0.068 / GB). But on a pure costing basis, for the amount of storage space you get in return these three drives are the absolute lost price/GB SSDs on sale right now. Team Group MP44L | 1 TB | M.2 2280 | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $79.99 $54.99 at Amazon (save $25)The MP44L is far from being the fastest SSD you can buy but for the money, you really can't complain. The read/write speeds are pretty low compared to others in our curated list, but they're still fast enough for most users and way better than a SATA SSD. If you avoid using it for heavy data transfers, you'll have no problems with it. Price check: Newegg $54.99 (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 2 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,800 MB/s write | $97.97 $92.97 at Amazon (save $5)You might not know Silicon Power from Samsung, but this SSD is well-received by our friends at Tom's Hardware. It offers plenty of speed for a Steam library expansion but with a meager cost per gigabyte of just four cents. It's not the fastest SSD out there, though. Price check: Newegg $92.97 (out of stock) | $144.99 at B&H Photo (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 4 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $239.99 $189.97 at Amazon (save $50.02)This Silicon Power might not be the fastest of drives, but it's difficult to argue with this much storage for this sort of money. With a sequential read/write of 5,000 MB/s and 4,500 MB/s, it's still not what you'd call slow and should be fine for gaming; plus it comes from a reliable brand. You know what I love most in tech? A piece of kit that punches above its weight class, something that delivers build quality and great value. That's where I am with the Corsair TC100 Relaxed gaming chair. Is it the outright best place to park your butt when gaming? No, those are more expensive. But it is a really, really good chair. And what's more it's still retaining its Black Friday discount being just $180 at Best Buy. And Corsair. And B&H Photo. In fact, it's only not on Amazon because it had a run on the chairs and now it's out of stock, which is the second time in a week that it's gone out of stock at the retailer. Which is the best part of this particular deal. Not only is it a great product, and not only is it available at an unprecedentedly low price, but it's also available at that price in three separate locations, which gives me hope that anyone who wants one has a good chance of being able to buy one at this discounted price. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) Okay, so it's not specifically a 'deal' but if you're at all interested in VR this is where the smart money goes. The Meta Quest 3S is the best-value gateway to virtual reality, being essentially an updated version of the classic Quest 2 for around the same money. Representing more of a step up, however, is the Quest 3, which ups the ante again for comfort and visuals. I think, even at its $500 price tag, it's a good price for the best VR headset around. So much so, that I bought one for my wonderful big brother's birthday; happy birthday, Rich! 🎁 I would absolutely recommend getting a new head strap, though, because the basic ones are pretty rubbish. Meta Quest 3S | 1832 x 1920 per eye | 72 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $299 at AmazonIn our Meta Quest 3S review, we praise this little VR headset's great processor, price, and stable tracking. It is missing a 3.5 mm jack, comes with a lower base storage, and the screen is the same as the second-generation model (which is noticeably worse than the Quest 3) but these are the main places you will notice the over $200 price difference. If you order with the code 'QUEST100' at checkout on December 1, you'll also get a $100 digital credit for Amazon, which is pretty sweet, and the bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 (doesn't come with digital credit) Meta Quest 3 | 2064 x 2208 per eye | 72 Hz, 80 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $499.99 at AmazonWith great tracking, a strong mobile chip, and dual LCD pancake lenses, the Meta Quest 3 is the strongest VR headset the company currently offers. Unfortunately, there is no Cyber Monday sale for it but it's already an impeccably well-valued headset, being the best VR headset for gaming right now. Though not a new offering, buying a Meta Quest 3 also gets you Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+, Meta's monthly game subscription service. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 There were some outstanding screens on offer over Black Friday, and I'm happy to report that three of our favorite OLED gaming monitors over that time are still on offer over the weekend. They all fill a spot in our Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals hub, and offer different displays for different kinds of gamer. But, crucially, they're all three OLED panels for under $900, which is testament to how the market has developed over the past year. There are two ultrawide monitors, one a 34-incher and the other ultrawiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide, at 49-inches. Then there is my personal favorite, the 32-inch 4K OLED from MSI for $700 at Amazon. That would be where my would go, because I love the 4K OLED I'm using at the moment, and I think it's a great panel. MSI MAG 341CQP | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 175 Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $779.99 $575.99 at Amazon (save $204)OLED gaming still isn't as affordable as we'd like. But it's getting there. This 34-inch ultrawide QD-OLED beast is still a good deal at this price, however. The 175 Hz refresh is a tiny bit pedestrian, but it's plenty fast enough for us and, in all other regards, this is the full OLED experience, including 0.03 ms response time and serious HDR sizzle. Price check: Newegg $599.99 MSI MAG 321UP | 32-inch | 4K | 165 Hz | QD-OLED | $829.99 $699.99 at Amazon (save $130)What a difference a letter makes... especially when it comes to gaming monitors. The code names given to monitors are often impenetrable, but the difference between this MAG 321UP and the MAG321UPX is that this one has a 165 Hz refresh instead of 240 Hz. That's the only difference between this and the more expensive one. If you're not concerned about the refresh rate difference (and do you have the hardware to hit a matching 240 fps otherwise?) then this is where the smart OLED money is spent. Price check: Newegg $699.99 Gigabyte Aorus CO49DQ | 49-inch | 5120 x 1440 | 144Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $1,099.99 $899.99 at Amazon (save $200)It's not been around for long but the Aorus CO49DQ already has a decent discount, and it's a lot of monitor for the money as we found in our review. Those rocking the RTX 4090 might be better off with the higher refresh rate of the Samsung Odyssey G9 G93SC, but the rest of us can take advantage of this very wide, very pretty looking panel for a bit less.Price check: Best Buy $899.99 If you want to do a Bane and "go mobile" you could do a lot worse than the handheld gaming PCs still on offer as we come into Cyber Monday. Batman's Bane? Too obscure? Ah, I'm going to run with it. Two of the best gaming handhelds are rocking a hefty discount right now, with the LCD Steam Deck available for a stunningly cheap, almost Nintendo Switch-level price at $337 from Steam. There's also our top pick overall, the ROG Ally X, for $700 at Best Buy right now, and it's older sibling is $485 at Amazon. Those two handhelds essentially use the same APU, so will deliver similar performance, but the Ally X is the better of the two, with a better screen, better cooling, and a much bigger battery. But the old ROG Ally, with the Z1 Extreme chip, was still a good device... so long as you didn't use an SD card with it. They were prone to, erm, breaking. Just make sure you go for the one with the Z1 Extreme chip in it, not the straight Ryzen Z1 chip. That version of the Ally is also on sale for what looks like a good price, but the difference between the two chips is such that I wouldn't want the lower-spec Ally even at its deal price. I'd absolutely go with the Steam Deck over the Z1 Ally. Price watch:➖Steam Deck (LCD) | 512 GB SSD | SteamOS | $449 $336.75 at Steam (save $112.25)Okay, the Steam Deck may have had an OLED refresh and there are heaps of more powerful handhelds around, but the original version is still the archetype of what a mobile PC gaming device should be. It's just as powerful as the most recent model so all those Steam Deck compatible games should run well. It's the OG PC gaming handheld, and it still demands respect. At the very least because SteamOS is wicked and it's extremely affordable with this deal (which goes on until December 4 if you want more time to think). Price watch: 🔽Lenovo Legion Go | Z1 Extreme | 8.8-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $699.99 $472.97 at Amazon (save $227.02)The Legion Go is one of the more polished handhelds on the market, with a sleek 8.8-inch screen and detachable controllers. That screen is a little overkill for the lil' AMD chip inside this machine, the Z1 Extreme also found in the ROG Ally, but it's great for playing indies on while relaxing. One of the controllers also becomes a mouse if you need it, which is a bit of a gimmick but works pretty well. Price check: Newegg $499.99 | Best Buy $549.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $589.99 $485 at Amazon (save $104.99)The original ROG Ally—still a strong performer even next to its improved sibling, the ROG Ally X. That's because they are both powered by the same Z1 Extreme chip from AMD. Considering the money off the original Ally, there's something to be said for choosing this over the X, though the bigger battery life on the X is definitely a huge improvement. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally X | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 24 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy (save $100)The ROG Ally X is a little bit too new to receive a massive discount. However, as our pick as the best handheld gaming PC to buy right now, even a $100 off is worth mentioning. Combining a generous helping of RAM, which really matters with an APU, alongside a 1 TB SSD and awesome form factor, the ROG Ally X is top of the charts for a reason. Price check: Asus $799.99 There are some deals I'm particularly happy about them having survived Black Friday and still being on offer over Cyber Monday and into Cyber Week. This being one of them. I love the Mountain Everest 60 keyboard, and I've played with every enthusiast keeb going, yet this is still the one I come back to. ☝️ That's me cradling my own Everest 60 looking tired because I am still live blogging deals. Over Black Friday it was $40 for Amazon Prime Members, but now it $40 at Amazon for everyone. So, everyone should buy one. Though the older TKL Everest board is also on offer for $40 at the Mountain store, and there's the full-fat Everest Max, with all the wrist rest, numpad, and controller extras included for $80, too. That was a nigh $300 kit when it launched, btw. Mountain Everest 60 | Mechanical | 60% | RGB | $69.99 $39.99 at Amazon (save $30)The Mountain Everest 60 is a perfect example of not having to spend a lot to get a cracking keyboard. Not only does it have hot-swappable switches and RGB, it's also wonderful to type on thanks to a plethora of enthusiast design choices such as great foam dampening, pre-lubed switches, and PBT keycaps. Oh, and you can snap on modular magnetic upgrades down the line, too, such a a numpad. This is the absolute cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've ever seen. The Lenovo LOQ range of laptops was always meant to be its more budget oriented line of gaming laptops, but they launched at a price that just didn't make sense considering their constraints. But we've seen some good discounts on them over Black Friday, and now this is probably my favorite Cyber Monday gaming laptop deal, and it's not even Monday yet. The miserly 512 GB SSD is pretty Scrooge-like, but aside from that the spec on offer here is outstanding for the money, and will make a fantastic gaming machine for someone. The RTX 4070 is a genuine 115 W version, so a very capable pixel pusher, and I've always been a big fan of Lenovo's laptop keyboards; they the best in the business. It's a win from me. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. iBuyPower is currently sitting pretty atop our guide to the best gaming PC you can buy right now, and it's also got a full suite of fantastic offers we've just dropped into our Cyber Monday gaming PC deals hub. We've had its rigs on this list for the super budget RTX 4060 machines over the Black Friday period, but here I want to highlight the more powerful, but still almost affordable gaming PCs it has on discount at the moment. Just don't forget the sneaky BLACKFRIDAY promo code for the big added discounts on the list price you'll see on the iBuyPower site. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this one, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. iBuyPower RDY Y60 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,299 $1,599 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)This one's for those of you who expect to be doing some serious creative or productivity work alongside your gaming. That's because in addition to the RTX 4070 Super that's the heart of this PC's gaming chops, plus its 2 TB of storage and 32 GB of fast RAM, there's also a hefty 14900KF working as its brain. Make extra sure its BIOS is up to date, and then get churning through any CPU-heavy task you desire. iBuyPower RDY Lancool 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4080 Super| 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,799 $2,099 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Not only is this a great deal on an RTX 4080 Super build at not too far north of $2,000, but it's also an incredibly well-rounded one. We're talking 32 GB of snappy DDR5 RAM, 2 TB of storage (which is the ideal capacity for all but ultra-high-end or budget builds), and, most importantly, a 24-core i9 14900KF. Just make sure the PC's BIOS is up to date to prevent any Intel voltage funkiness. iBuyPower RDY Y70 TI B02 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4090 | 64 GB DDR5-6000 | 4 TB (2x2 TB) SSD | $3,999 $3,299 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Here we have something I can only describe as a behemoth, a mighty specimen whose name is overkill. 24-core CPU? Check. Most powerful graphics card on the market? Check. Double the RAM and storage of most expensive gaming PCs? Yep, check that, too. The only downside is this one doesn't come with the screen on the chassis that the Y70 04 above does. But that's a matter of preference anyway, I suppose. We have seen some cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming PCs over Black Friday, but they're all out of stock right now. There are also cheaper options available right now, but none that have a spec that I'm as confident about as this Yeyian machine. It's another Yeyian Tanto gaming PC, for $750 at Newegg, but comes with the 10-core, 14-thread Core i5 13400F. I know there's been a lot made of Intel's troubles with the 13th and 14th Gen chips, but so long as you get your mobo's BIOS updated (as you should anyways) then there won't be any issue with this impressive budget machine. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. One of those new Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals I was talking about is actually the best-value RTX 4070 machine that I think I've ever seen. I've been working all hours over the past week, so my brain might be a little mushy at this point, but I don't remember seeing another RTX 4070 gaming laptop that I'd actually buy at this price point. The HP Victus 16 is just $930 at Best Buy today. Seriously. There's nothing really that sticks out as a big 🚩either. That RTX 4070 seems to be either a 115 or 120 W TGP, so should be pretty damned performant, and you're getting plenty speed 16 GB of DDR5 memory, too. Obviously that 512 GB is going to be an issue down the line, but the Victus 16 has a spare M.2 easily accessible under the rear casing, so you can just drop in a new 1 or 2 TB SSD as and when you need more space. Price watch: NEW DEAL!HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $929.99 at Best Buy (save $470)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Right. Let's have it. OLED displays with up to five times better lifespan may be on their way sooner than you think, thanks to a manufacturing breakthrough 'Inspired by wind-sculpted desert rocks' and bestowed with Intel Lunar Lake, the new MSI Claw handhelds might actually be worth a look Intel's new second-gen XeSS 2 upscaling tech with Frame Generation matches Nvidia's DLSS for features and might have the edge on AMD's FSR PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is ticking towards a close, and Nintendo Switch deals have been flying judging by how many are running out of stock. A lot of the direct discounts on bundles have gone, but there are still some late savings about, including some great deals on Nintendo Switch games. - Quick links- Console deals- Game deals- Accessory deals- Live updates As often with Switch, many of the best deals are in the UK, where you can get a Switch Lite bundle with Animal Crossing: New Horizons and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online down from £199 to £189. You can also get a Switch OLED console alone for £229 at On Buy – super close to the lowest price I've seen. Keep checking our blog below for live updates on the latest Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch games, accessories and console deals as soon as we spot them. And for advice, see our Nintendo Switch vs Switch OLED piece. Most of the bundle deals we're seeing in the US right now are out of stock, but we're checking them regularly and will let you know if any re-appear. This bundle deal is one of the best we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, and while it's out of stock at both Target and Walmart, it keeps coming back every so often. The bundle includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe + 12 months of Switch online membership, which gets you access to hundreds of games from Nintendo's back catalogue. Price check: $349.99 at Amazon $299.99 at Amazon There's no direct cash saving here, but you get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe thrown in for the normal price of the standard Switch console alone. Price check: $299.99 at Nintendo Save £118.46: This is one of the best OLED deals I've seen as it includes one of Nintendo's best games - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - and its Booster Course Pass worth £22.49, as well as 12 months subscription to Nintendo Online. Price check: Amazon £429.99 Save £10: This is only £10 off the usual retail price but that's better than nothing right now, considering that Switch deals are selling out pretty rapidly across the UK right now. Save £10 PLUS added value: We rarely see discounts on the Switch Lite model, so any deal no matter how small should be seen as a win. While this deal says it's only £10 off, there is actually plenty more value in this bundle. It includes a download code for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, one of the most popular Switch games played during lockdown, PLUS 12 months of Switch Online included. Save $10 PLUS added value: Again, this might not seem like a very big bundle discount initially, but there is extra value here that you may not notice. You get the Sports bundle + 12 months of Switch Online. A new console is usually £250 on its own, so these are just extra free perks. Save £70: This is a genuinely good deal, that's been running all week, but it's fluctuating quite a bit. Since our last update, the price has increased by £1, but this console deal remains a brilliant price (the lowest was £220 earlier in the week). Price check: Amazon £279 | Argos: £279.99 Save $20: Legend of Zelda is a game that unites the generations like no other, and Link is back in Tears of the Kingdom to defend Hyrule against malevolent forces with new abilities to explore. Target was beating this deal with $30 off on Black Friday. That deal's gone, but this is still one of the best discounts we've seen. Price Check: $52.99 (European version) at Amazon Best UK price: $44.99 at Amazon Save 64%: This is one of the best games on Nintendo Switch, and I scored it 5/5 in my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review; for this price there's no excuse not to own one of the console's best Metroidvanias. Save $20: This is one of the most popular games right now across all platforms (not just the Nintendo Switch) and it's easy to see why. This new SEGA action-adventure title teams up old Sonic generations to defeat Dr. Eggman and Time Eater in a timeline-saving dash. My favourite is the Pinball challenge in the casino zone. Price Check: $29.99 at Best Buy | $30 at Walmart Save 49%: The successor to last year's mega-hit, FC 24, this new videogame instalment replaces what we all used to know as FIFA, and celebrates one of the world's biggest sports. It's almost half off, which makes it super tempting for football fans. Save $35: One of the most popular video game characters of all time, Sonic the Supersonic Hedgehog is back in this exhilarating adventure across the five Starfall Islands. Price Check: $31.99 at Best Buy | $39.99 at Target SAVE $30: Anime fans will love this one from Bandai Namco. Experience a new adventure as Luffy: search for the Straw Hats and get your crew back together while scouting mysterious islands and dungeons with a twist. The deal on the digital game. Price Check: $47.45 at Amazon Save 57%: Officially licensed for Nintendo Switch, this is a sweet deal on an unsexy but very useful SD card. It has dropped lower before (to $8.99 actually) but this still a marvellous price. Also available discounted at Best Buy in multiple storage sizes. Save 25%: The Turtle Beach Recon 50 is the best value headset for Nintendo Switch from this well-regarded brand. Perfect for online games of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. A lot of the games with the biggest discounts are ones from big TV and movie franchises like Star Wars (33% off the Heritage Pack), Sponge Bob (38% off the Patrick Star Game), Jurassic Park (25% off the Collection) and Transformers (38% off Galactic Trials). There are still Cyber Monday Switch game deals about. Amazon has a whole bunch of big discounts on Sonic games, including 40% off Sonic X Shadow Generations and 38% off Sonic Mania and Sonic Team Racing. Back over in the US, there's little left in terms of deals on consoles, I'm afraid. The best options are the Switch and Switch OLED bundle deals at Nintendo and Amazon. These aren't specifically Cyber Monday deals, but at least you get a game thrown in with the console. At this stage, it's very unlikely that any new deals will appear, so these are likely to be the best options for the rest of Cyber Monday, and even the rest of the year. There will be another window for deals after Christmas, but January sales haven't tended to bring up a lot of Switch discounts. This is another UK Switch OLED Bundle deal that i'd consider. It's not being billed as a Cyber Monday deal, but it's a great price when you consider that it's £10 cheaper than the RRP of the OLED console alone, and you get Super Mario Wonder and 12 months' of Nintendo Switch Online included. In the UK, Cyber Monday is very nearly over, so let's round up what's left at... Very. There are still a couple of bundle deals as well as savings on games. Here's my pick of the best. All of these are at Very, which has tended to be one of the best places for Switch bundle deals in the UK over the past few years. Some of these are specifically flagged as Black Friday deals, so I expect they will end at midnight. Direct savings on Switch consoles are few and far between now as Cyber Monday proceedings creep towards a close. I have noticed this small saving on the standard Switch in grey, though. It's not really a discount to shout about, but it's something at least if you want the console in that colour. Over in the UK, the best price on Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is £44.99 at Amazon and at Currys, a saving of £10. The best Nintendo Switch game deal of all Black Friday and Cyber Monday was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for just $39.99 at Target. That deal's now gone sadly, but the next best thing is a saving of $20 on the digital edition of the game at Best Buy. It's still one of the best deals we've seen on a title that continues to top our pick of the best Nintendo Switch games. It's across the US that we're seeing most sold out bundle deals. In the UK there are still some offers available. My favourite is this Nintendo Switch Lite Animal Crossing Bundle, which comes with a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, which gives you access to some fantastic classic games. Get the Switch Lite Animal Crossing bundle for £199 £189 at Argos Should you buy a deal right now if you see it? We'll be honest with you, yes. We've seen stock running out across various bundle deals so if you see something you like, we advise you to go for it. Hello there! Hi there deal hunters! It's Rosie Hilder here, logging on shortly before I finish my shift. I'm gonna have a quick look around to check if any more offers have appeared and I'll be back shortly with my findings. If you like your controllers separate from your Switch display, then another Joy-Con alternative to consider is the NYXI Hyperion Pro. I've personally reviewed this controller (or controllers should I say, since they come in a pair), and it functions exactly the same as official Nintendo Joy-Cons but with a chunkier design, and colour-changing LED lights for that neon gamer aesthetic that we all love. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Meteor and NYXI Hyperion Pro reviews for all of the details. Not a big fan of the official Joy-Con controllers that come with your Nintendo Switch? There are plenty of other (and much better) options out there for a more comfortable gaming experience. One of the most popular Joy-Con alternatives is the CRKD Nitro Deck, which is essentially a dock that your Nintendo Switch display slots into. It's classy in black, but also comes in other variants to give your console that retro aesthetic should you choose. The CRKD Nitro Deck is on sale this Cyber Monday for $69.99 $49.99 over at Amazon in the US, and for £37.49 at Amazon in the UK. If you're looking for a fun Nintendo Switch accessory this Cyber Monday, might I recommend this BMO Switch dock from Amazon? Modelled after the loveable Adventure Time character. I own this dock myself and I love it, but it's more of a stand really than a working dock, as there are no slots for connecting peripherals. In other words, it's an excellent stand for keeping your Switch sturdy while you play in tabletop mode, but it's no good for connecting your console to the TV. There are 3 colour options to choose from, Blue, Orange or Pink – and each option is reduced to only $16.73 for Cyber Monday, down from $24.98, saving you $8.25. There are Cyber Monday deals on some fun Nintendo-themed merchandise, including deals on Paladone gifts, collectibles and more. Take a look below at some of my favourite offers: The best Nintendo Switch games under $20, available now. Save 53% Was $39.99, now $18.74 The Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 features three of PlayStation's best games on Nintendo Switch. Plus this collection features the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear for NES, as well as documentary and other extras. Save 60% Was $49.99, now $19.99 The recently released Just Dance 2025 Edition – Limited Edition has never been priced this low before. This series has been hugely popular ever since release, and a great game to play with the kids on Christmas Day. This Limited Edition comes with cosmetic extras. Save 50% Was $39.99, now $19.99 Being a huge fan of The Karate Kid and retro games it's kind of hard not pass up on this on this deal. Game Mill's new pixel art brawler draws inspiration from classic games like Renegade and Double Dragon, as well as characters and scenes from the films (now a Netflix show). That last games round up was fun, let's see if I can find enough good Switch games under $10? What do you think? Is it possible? I did buy House of the Dead: Remake for $24.99 on Saturday, so maybe it's possible. Challenge accepted. The best Nintendo Switch games on sale for under $40 Getting or have a Nintendo Switch? Then below are my pick of the best games under $40 this Cyber Monday, including some classics, hidden gems and more. I've played these games, so they're recommended personally. (Including the GTA Trilogy that recently received an update that fixes its visuals, bugs and added new features like 'classic lighting mode'.) US readers - if you want a set of Turtle Beach headphones for Nintendo Switch then there are a couple of good dealsI can recommend. While Turtle Beach Recon 50 isn't on offer in the US, two other models are. I've set the deals out below. Turtle Beach make some of the best headsets for gaming, and the widely loved Turtle Beach Recon 50 is on sale for Cyber Monday. Unlike other brands, this affordable headset comes in the Nintendo Switch colours. If you don't want to spend too much on a gaming headset but want quality the Turtle Beach Recon 50 is a good buy. There's 35% off Turtle Beach Recon 50 at Amazon: £19.99 £13.99 Want the free Mario Christmas tree ornament from my previous post? Then I've found the best buys from the Nintendo Store that will take you just over the £70 fresh hold to earn your treat. Free gifts This game isn't on sale but if you buy it now on Cyber Monday it comes with some free Nintendo goodies, including Super Mario Party Jamboree themed Coaster Set, snack bowl and blanket. At £74.49 it just creeps above Nintendo's margin to earn the Mario ornament. The cutely named Alarmo is a clock like no other, it features a digital display that can be programmed to reflect your favourite Nintendo games, and includes Nintendo's unique fonts and 35 themed alarms. It also has sensors to note when you move and are awake. The collector's statue features Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and comes with a Sheikah Slate, Ancient Arrow and base that all feature LED functions. The statue us packaged in a collector's box. I just spied Nintendo's free gift! If you spend more than £70 on the Nintendo Store over Cyber Monday you get a free Mario holiday ornament to hang on the Christmas tree. Visit the Nintendo Store and claim your free ornament with orders over £90. The thing I love about Nintendo Switch is its handheld mode - and in all honesty, it's the way most of us play on the console. While I buy a lot of games over the eShop these days, it's still nice to have a collection of physical games, especially when travelling and access to WiFi can be limited. So below I've found the three best Nintendo Switch case deals available right now for Cyber Monday. Each has storage for the console, leads and game cards. Save 24% Was $19.91, now $15.19 at Amazon This case for Nintendo Switch features a protective hardshell outer case, with pockets for spare controllers, cables and a couple of cards. It's water-resistant and designed like an official Nintendo case. Save 40% Was $12.59, now $7.58 at Amazon Every Nintendo Switch owner needs a dedicated game card wallet, and this one from FYY is a good choice and has a whopping 40% off the retail price. It can store 24 game cards and 48 micro SD cards, so you never misplace a game. Save 25% Was $19.99, now $14.99 at Amazon Made from premium materials, including a ballistic outer hardshell case, this is fully licensed and tested by Nintendo for use with all Switch consoles. It even features a viewing stand and comes with extra game cases. This is the #1 selling Switch case in the USA and it's reduced for Cyber Monday. Get Nintendo SwitchSports + Super Mario Party Jamboree + Nintendo Online at Very, for £308.99 £289 (save £19.99). I literally bought the Nintendo Switch Sports bundle last year and now you can get it for less, with Super Mario Party Jamboree included and Nintendo Online added, too. So, of course I'd recommend this deal. If you have kids, nieces and nephews, or grandchildren this is a great bundle as both the included games are designed for the family and multiplayer. (And Nintendo Online offers access to hundreds of free retro games so oldies like me can settle in to a Metroid marathon on Boxing Day.) Hey, it's Ian here now, taking over from Georgia. I'm Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Art and 3D and spend my time writing about all things, well… digital art and 3D, including game art, game design and reviewing Switch games.In a past life I was editor of Official PlayStation Magazine and have been writing about video games professionally since 1998, when Nintendo, Sony and Sega we're going head to head. But you're here for Nintendo Switch deals, and I'm going to find you some good ones, I promise. After yesterday's deals search I ended up buying House of the Dead Remake for my Switch, so let me just pause it and start the deals search. We're not seeing many Switch deals in the UK, but right now you can bag the Switch Lite for $185, a saving of $15. Which is better than nothing, right? Right? Rumours about the Nintendo Switch 2 have been hotting up for what feels like forever, but it's sounding like the souped-up Switch sequel might finally appear at the start of next year. For every rumour in one place, take a look at our main Nintendo Switch 2 page. You know what I think the best thing is about the Nintendo Switch? You can play Goldeneye on it. The 1997 N64 game has a special place in my heart, as I spent countless hours on it as a wee lad. For decades the only way to play it again was to dust off an old N64, but Goldeneye finally hit Nintendo Switch Online last year. And with that $50 off OLED deal at Walmart, you get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online thrown in. One of the best deals we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend is $50 off the Nintendo Switch OLED bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online. This deal is out of stock at Target, but Walmart has just brought it back, with the bundle down to $299. This one won't be hanging around for long. In previous years we might have suggested holding on before committing to buying a Switch OLED – but in 2024 things are different. With the Switch landscape about to change with the advent of the Nintendo Switch 2 (or is that Switch Pro?) – here's why. Animal Crossing arrived on the Switch at just the right time. With the world plunged into lockdown, this cosy universe offered a welcome break from those unprecedented times, with millions diving head-first into the game. It's still a delight, and right now in the UK, Argos is offering an Animal Crossing bundle with the Switch Lite and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online, down from £199 to £189. In the UK, Amazon is currently offering a renewed Nintendo Switch Lite for £149.99, down from the RRP of £199. Amazon's renewed models are almost as good as brand new. Amazon says these are "inspected, tested and cleaned in accordance with Amazon Renewed requirements to be fully functional." Good morning, Dan here taking over the Nintendo Switch live blog. But first, I'd like to wish a very happy Cyber Monday to all who celebrate. I certainly do – I'm wearing my Cyber Monday jumper and hat as we speak, and was made sure to wish everybody I passed on my commute to the office a friendly 'Cyber greetings'. Now, let's Switch (lol!) to the matter at hand. Since we left you, the Nintendo Switch deals landscape has changed, with old deals dying and new sprouting. I'll be bringing you all the latest info this morning, so keep your eyes peeled on this blog, and the deals information above. Okay gamers, It's just past 1am in the UK right now which means it's officially Cyber Monday! I'm signing off for the night, but stick with us (and this blog) first thing tomorrow to be kept in the loop about any fresh Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals as soon as we spot them. One of the worst things about owning a Nintendo Switch is the dreaded Joy-Con drift. I'm sure most Switch gamers have experienced this at some point, or if you haven't, then count yourself lucky. Stick drift is a very common issue where joysticks tend to shift out of place over time, so it's as if your character is moving on its own (or something else is happening on screen) that isn't your doing. There are plenty of newer controllers and joypads on the market that are now swapping out analogue sticks for what's known as hall effect joysticks instead, which promise absolutely zero stick drift. I've put together a guide of the best Joy-Con alternatives full of controllers that will work with your Nintendo Switch console, but never develop stick drift. Thank me later. What else can I tell you about the Nintendo Switch? Probably not much that you don't already know. Although, I did recently learn that you can use a Nintendo Switch with compatible AR Smart glasses. These are essentially wearable monitors that let you experience gameplay on a cinema-sized screen, which would be perfect for situations when you're without a screen or Nintendo Switch dock, like when travelling on a plane. If you're interested, I've rounded up some Cyber Monday deals on Smart Glasses that actually tempted me to buy a pair. Hi guys, it's Beth again 👋 Inspired by Georgia's post below about the Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set, I've found some super cool deals on Mega Blocks Pokémon sets over at Amazon that I think could make excellent stocking fillers for gamers 🎮 These Pokémon sets aren't officially Lego-branded, but instead are classed as MEGA Bloks which is a different brand owned by Mattel. I actually own two of these Pokémon Lego-alternative sets already, the Snorlax and Jumbo Pikachu sets, and they're really fun and challenging to build. You can find a few other options in a previous deals roundup I made a while back. Save 16% Was $58.99, now $49.50 at Amazon Save 38% Was $99.99, now $61.59 at Amazon Save $67 Was $171.99, now $104.99 at Amazon Of course you could always opt for a refurbished Switch if you wanted to save some extra pennies, and think about the environment, too. Most retailers have certified renewed models, often with warranties for a year or more. These are often returned devices that have been wiped clean and spruced up by a very capable tech team. You can even buy these direct from Nintendo and if that doesn't give you peace of mind, nothing will. Find renewed Nintendo Switch Lite consoles for $169, OLED from $319 and the standard Switch from $259.99. I just got stuck in a little hole of looking through the concepts people made back when the Switch 2 was going to be called the Switch Pro (in our heads anyway) and we had NO idea what it would be like, or when it was coming. We covered some of those concepts in news pieces. The first is a render made by Zone of Tech: We see what they did there. Kinda like a Lite but with zingier colours. And isn't this one delightful? I'd totally buy a purple Switch, though I know that's not the point at all. That screen looks like it's hiding some gorgeous graphics. I love how casually Nintendo announced the Switch 2. Just a little tweet, that's all it took to announce the biggest development in gaming handhelds, and one we were waiting for for years! Read all about the announcement here. Would I still recommend buying the Switch in the light of the news? Well, yes actually I would. But only the OLED and the Lite. I don't think there's a point in buying the standard console, unless you're on a very tight budget. Give it's eight years old I think you'd be better off spending a bit more to get the OLED Switch. And if I'm really honest I think they might discontinue that original one next year to realign the range. I remember back in 2021, an engineer made a GIANT Nintendo Switch. It was incredible. And that is how big the Switch looms in my brain after the whole weekend deal hunting. It was a fully working Switch that was 650% larger than a normal console! That means it was 70 inches wide and 30 inches tall... and it weighted an epic 29.5kg. It even had a 4K display. Pretty amazing if you wanted a cinema-like Nintendo Switch experience, eh? Read all about the giant Switch here. And watch the video below! There's also a really nice Mario Wonder OLED bundle deal at Argos if you're in the UK. You can get the OLED console plus the Super Mario Bros. Wonder game and that great Switch Online membership I've been banging on about for £289.99. There's a lot of added value here that could make it a viable alternative to that other UK deal from On Buy. If you're wanting a game to play, in fact hundreds of games, then this is the one for you. You'll only end up spending about that much on a similar amount of content if you go for a standalone console. I've just found a brilliant non-Switch deal I actually want to tell you about. We've recommended the sale price on the Sonic X Shadow Switch game above, but what about a Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set?! Target has got a stellar 30% off that set right now, saving you $21 and bringing it to $48.99. It's a really fun Shadow the Hedgehog head – and is the perfect gift for a Sonic fan (or yourself). You could build it then look admiringly at it while playing the associated game on your brand new Switch! There's a plan. Not totally sure how to use the Switch to its fullest capabilities? We've put together some handy tips and tricks for you to boost your gameplay. 12 pointers, in fact. From how to save battery life to customising your home screen, there are a bunch of useful ideas here for optimising your experience with the Switch. Find out our 12 tips for getting the most out of the Switch. If you've got this far you're likely to know which console you want. But if you're on the fence, or you're finding it hard to match your gaming priorities with your budget, then you'll want to read some stellar advice, I expect. For example, might it be worth dropping under the $200/£200 mark to get the Switch lite? If you're happy to keep your console in hand rather than play as a group through your TV then that might be a compromise you're willing to make. Are you happy with a slightly older, less flashy model? You could possibly be satisfied with the standard Switch console. Read 7 things to consider before buying a Switch here, and learn all about it. Hiya! It's Editor Georgia back again for an evening of deal hunting. I'm seeing so many standout deals sold out now, or returning to the usual price. This could mean an influx of new deals is set to drop – or it could be game over for Switch deals. In my experience, the kind of deal we saw this year (namely that $275 bundle deal that's now back to $349) will be limited. Not that I have much experience of that becuse normally there is very little to work with. But my guess it that that brilliant deal is over now because it would have been so popular! But I'll be happy to be wrong on this occasion. If tomorrow dawns and there are a whole host of new deals I'll be delighted to share them. It is worth noting that Amazon didn't take part in that big price slash. while Best Buy, Target AND Walmart did... Could the retail giant have something up its sleeve for tomorrow? If you're looking for some creative Nintendo stocking fillers in time for Christmas this year, we have a guide to the best Nintendo Stocking fillers for the gamers in your life. I really want the Lego Piranha Plant for my desk at home, and I think it would make an amazing gift for anyone wanting a unique office accessory (who needs a real houseplant when you have this?). There are tons of other options in the guide to suit a range of ages and budgets, so be sure to check it out if you need a gift to go along with your Nintendo Switch console purchase. One final accessory I'm recommending for any new Nintendo Switch owners is a case. If you don't already have one, then it's important to get a reliable case for your console to keep your Nintendo Switch display scratch-free, and keep out dust, plus you can also store your cartridges in most cases for safekeeping. The one I have is a leather Snorlax case which I bought on Amazon from a seller named PALPOW, but I think it's currently unavailable in the US and UK. Don't fret, here are five other Nintendo Switch cases that I would recommend below. • PowerA Protection Case • GeekShare Plush Protective Case • PALPOW Mario Switch Case • HORI Premium Vault Case • Tomtoc Switch Lite Case Need a dock for your Nintendo Switch? Cyber Monday is a great time to shop for Switch accessory deals, and we have a guide to the best Nintendo Switch docks to help you out. A docking station is one of the most essential Nintendo Switch accessories, and is compatible with both the standard Switch and Switch OLED models (but not the Switch Lite). I think it's fair to assume that plenty of you reading this will have experienced the dreaded Joy-Con drift (I know I have). If you're hoping to avoid that this Cyber Monday, then definitely take a look at the handy guide I put together on tried and tested Nintendo Switch Joy-Con alternatives that promise absolutely zero stick drift. The pair I own is the NYXI Hyperion Pro, and not only are these controllers gorgeous to look at with colour-changing LED but they operate in the exact same way as official Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons and even have motion controls too. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Pro review for all of the details. Keeping with the Pokémon theme, did you know that SanDisk has official Pokémon SD cards for the Nintendo Switch? There's a yellow Pikachu 256GB card, a Gengar 512GB card, and a Snorlax 1TB card which was on sale at Amazon for $134.99 $89.99 during Black Friday (I think this deal has sold out sadly) but you can get it dscounted at Amazon in the UK for £79.99 down from £127.99. My favourite game to play on my retro Nintendo 64 console is Pokémon Snap (maybe that's why I grew up to become a photographer 🤔), and this game was so popular back in the day that they remade it for the Nintendo Switch! The New Pokémon Snap (Nintendo Switch version) is on sale at Amazon right now for $59.99 $49.95, saving you $10 – and I highly recommend it if you love Pokémon games. You need to use your sharp eye to spot Pokémon in their natural habitat doing something interesting and snap a photo to earn a score. It's more fun than it sounds I promise. My first ever Nintendo console was the N64, which was passed onto me by my older brother when I was about 4 years old. I still have it today, and it sits proudly on my gaming shelf with a copy of Pokémon Stadium. I can't believe how expensive it is now to buy a Nintendo 64, although it is considered one of the best retro consoles ever. There are no Cyber Monday deals on the Nintendo 64 (obviously) but if you do fancy a hit of nostalgia you can pick one up for $110 at Amazon, or at Walmart for $114.95, which is actually a much better price than options I've been seeing on sites like eBay and Etsy. Hey gamers, Beth here! I thought I'd quickly introduce myself as I'll be taking over the blog for a while. I've owned my Nintendo Switch console since 2017, and I absolutely love it. I'm a huge Pokémon fan, but my favourite game to play right now is Disney Dreamlight Valley, as it's super chill and I love getting to unwind at the end of the day and complete tasks in my own Disney village. Beth is our Ecommerce Writer, and loves all things tech and gaming. She owns a PlayStation 5, Meta Quest 3, and Nintendo Switch, plus she used to work at a retail games store, so knows everything there is about the best Nintendo Switch prices and trade-in deals. Not to mention, she has a Snorlax tattoo, so if that doesn't scream Nintendo nerd we don't know what does. If you're looking for a Nintendo gift and a good deal, then the official Nintendo store is a good place to start. The online store features deals on games and Nintendo Switch consoles but it also sells branded gifts, accessories and merchandise. Below are some of my favourites: Balatro Special Edition is £24.99 £18.99 at Amazon, and I'm surprised. Balatro has been one of the year's more unusual games, but it's also one of the most awarded - and it's in the running to be crowned Game of the Year at the prestious The Game Awards held later this month. What is Balatro? It's an indie card game that mixes poker and and tactical card battling, and it's one of the most addictive games of 2024. When I started blogging about Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals today I really didn't expect Balatro to be on sale. The idea one of the biggest games of 2024 is reduced is, well… surprising. But then I did a little research, and it has been reduced before, but never to this low a price. The one thing better than finding a deal on a great Nintendo Switch game is finding a deal on a collector's edition. I rarely but collector's edition because they cost so much but on Cyber Monday you can often find a bargain. These special collector's editions include the game but also models, unique boxes and unique extras - they make great gifts. Below I've picked three of my favourite Nintendo Switch game collector's editions, some games are old but the bundles are good (and the best games remain classics and playable long after release - in fact some can be found on the best retro game consoles). Save 29% Was £84.99, now £59.99 at Amazon I grew up on the Turrican series, first playing it on Amiga, and while you can play it on AntStream Arcade, this collection for Nintendo Switch is a wonderful way to discover the classic shooters. This collector's edition features both Volume 1 and Volume 2, which includes every game released, plus an art book, documentary film, posters, stickers, soundtrack and more, all packaged in a designer box. Save 30% Was £49.99, now £34.99 at Amazon Spelunky HD os the remastered version of the breakout indie game that scooped numerous awards on release, and remains a fantastic game. It was originally made usinf GameMaker, the indie game engine. This collector's edition includes the Spelunky HD (which offers 3D or pixel art modes) as well as a specially designed box and art, with a figurine, level guide, soundtrack and more. The Spelunker HD Deluxe - Collector's Edition is limited to 1,300 editions. Save 5% Was £150.23, now £142.75 at Amazon The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack is one of the most popular and beautiful OSTs in gaming, and this collector's edition matches the music. It features 344 songs across nine CDs and comes with a collectible sword-shaped USB and it's all packaged into a striking designer box. Okay, it's not a game, but Zelda fans will adore this edition. Gifting online store IWOOT is a treasure trove of Nintendo goodies, present ideas and just weird rarities I never knew I wanted. There are small savings across the board on many of these collectibles, and it's well worth a look if you're struggling for a gift to buy the Ninty-fan in your life (or for you). The deals include £5 off Super Mario Monopoly £35.99 £30.99; it's the classic board game with added Mario. IWOOT also has Mario water bottles, Mushroom alarm clocks, Nintendo Christmas sweaters, Mario notebooks and mugs. I've just found some of the best Nintendo gifts on Etsy for any retro gamers reading this. A number of sellers have discounts on some eye-catching art prints, including Pop Art style illustrations of iconic Nintendo controllers. Below I've listed my favourites. If you're buying lots of games for Nintendo Switch then you'll need a good microSDXC card to store games and save data. There are some good deals on SanDisk cards for Switch, including Nintendo branded cards, this Cyber Monday, I've listed the best three below: Save 18% This is one of the best cards around, the SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSDXC card is now £42 £35 at Amazon, and it comes with a card reader too. There's also a deal on a two-pack bundle of 64GB SanDisk Extreme cards with a card read, now £28.98 £17.98 at Amazon. Save 15% This SanDisk card comes with Nintendo's branding, which means it's been tested by Nintendo to meet its high standards. This SanDisk 256GB card is now £21.99 £18.68 at Amazon. Save 17% This was £5 cheaper last Tuesday but it's rarely reduced below its RRP all year. This SanDisk card is another one tested and branded by Nintendo for Switch, and comes with the Animal Crossing leaf branding. This Animal Crossing SanDisk card is now £45.99 £37.99 at Amazon. I own a Switch original flavour, from way back, and even though it's brilliant and has saved me on some really dull flights (and post Christmas dinner slump) I'm toying with the idea of buying a Switch OLED today. I don't need a Switch OLED but it's a model the gamer in me wants - we're completists, right? We need the full collection. I've listed the best deal I'd buy / may buy… okay, will buy this Cyber Monday. This is coming home with me. Okay, I don't really want Super Mario Bros. Wonder but my nieces love Nintendo platformers, so I get my Switch OLED and they get a treat. The bundle costs £289.99 at Argos, and considering the OLED alone is £280 at Currys, this is a good deal. Add in a subscription to Nintendo Online, which as I shared earlier is really an entry into Nintendo's back catalogue of hundreds of retro games, deals, voucher offers and more, and this Argos deal is actually incredible value. One neat deals trick Nintendo Switch owners have long made use of that new owners need to know is the Nintendo Vouchers deal. Nintendo Online subscribers can buy two game vouchers for $99.98 / £84, to spend in the eShop on select games. The hack is games cost $59.99 / £49.99 so you're actually making a saving of around 25%. The best games in the voucher deal include: • Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition• The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom• Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door• Princess Peach: Showtime!• Pikmin 4 UK readers can buy vouchers here. It you're thinking of buying a Nintendo Switch in the Cyber Monday sales I'd urge you to sign-up for a Nintendo Online subscription. You can trial three months for free before signing up, but a subscription offers access to hundreds of classic games from Nintendo and Sega, including games released for SNES, Mega Drive, N64 and more. Nintendo regularly updates the list of retro games with new entries, such as Banjo-Tooie, and Sega has just added more to its collection. You can now even play classic game soundtracks with the Nintendo Music app (see below). Find out more on the Nintendo website. Even Nintendo Switch games that only just released can be found with small discounts for Cyber Monday. Below I've listed some eye-catching offers on brand new games, including the adorable The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and the Tomb Raider Remastered Trilogy, which I bought at launch and comes highly recommended (the final three games release 14 Feb next year in the Tomb Raider IV-V-VI Remastered bundle). To start things off, let's get personal. Not too personal, we don't know one another that well, but below I've found deals on three of my favourite Nintendo Switch games that I play regularly and come highly recommended. At full price these are great, with money off they're even better. Save $32 There's a massive 62% off one of my favourite games on Switch and one of the best Metroidvanias for the console, now just $17.97 at Amazon. Read my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review. Save $20 Now $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy. This charming tactical-puzzler in which you guide an army of adorable creatures over obstacles and battles is one of the most original series on Nintendo Switch. Save $20 Another reduced from $59.99 to $39.99 at Best Buy, and it remains one of the console's hidden gems. A platforming classic with a weird sense of humour, you'll love this. Hey deal hunters, it's Ian Dean here, Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Arts & 3D, I'll be tracking down all the big offers and latest discounts for you on all Nintendo Switch consoles, games and fun stuff.I've been gaming since I could crawl and have been writing about games professionally since 1998, in a past life I sat opposite the Official Nintendo Magazine team has they argued over which Mario game is the best. As I sit here I literally have Metroid Prime Remastered on pause - my own personal Black Friday Switch treat. We're not 'switching' over to Cyber Monday deals, and there can often be some late offers on Nintendo games, accessories and collectibles as we head to the sales end. Stay with me, and we'll find some bargains. This morning has been a wild ride, my friends. I'm about to head off (apparently, I have a family and hobbies and shopping and clothes to wash who knew), but I wanted to alert you to a big Best Buy deal on my colleague Kimberly's favourite game: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Legend of Zelda is a big obsession for many of my friends, and if like Kimberly, you want to get all 1001 korok seeds, hurry up: she's up to 982. Wake up Demon Slayer fans! I have Cyber Monday goody news for you, because Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for Switch is a big ol' $20 off on Amazon now, down to a equal-to-lowest-ever $39.99, from $59.99. It's overwhelmingly well reviewed, and looks gorgeous too, so get going before it's out of stock, my beautiful cherubs. Right, while I get some coffee and find the next deal to highlight, please enjoy this new Mario Kart theme from my current content-creator obsession, Carter Vail. Fret not, my American brethren, I haven't forgotten you. I have a sister in Denver, after all. For you, and just you, my beautiful, smart, funny and charming readers, I have found this lowest-ever price for the officially licensed PDP Switch controller. The wireless model is usually $54.99, but for Cyber Monday, it's been knocked down to $49.99, which is the lowest it's ever been. I've got the PDP controller for my PC (Xbox spec), and I absolutely love it. It works fantastically and looks beautiful too, so I have no doubt that the Switch one is as high-quality as that one. There's also a wide selection of colours, so you can find one to fit your interior decor to a tee. If, like me, you prefer a 'classic' controller rather than the Nintendo joy-cons, you're probably browsing for some nice Switch controller deals. And there's quite a few available. Perhaps the best-looking one is this Switch-themed controller from well-liked maker Cehensy, and it's a nice 20% off, down to only £17.58 (while it's still in stock, that is, controllers go out of stock real fast). I've used Cehensy controllers in the past, and based on the ones I've used, as well as customer reviews of this one, this controller is an excellent value deal. It's wireless too, which is always nice... I like games, let's find more games deals. The rather fantastic EA Sports FC 25 is almost half-price on Amazon UK right... now. We have played FC 24 to oblivion in this household and considering the reviews for the new'un, this might be the offer that compels me to get this one. My favourite feature in FC 24 was the Career mode, and that's carried over and further developed in FC 25, where you can develop your own superstar in the dog-eat-dog world of professional association football. Listen up, UK deal hunters. Finding big discounts on Switch consoles is always hard, but there is real value to be found in bundle deals. And I've found one I particularly like this morning (maybe it's because I'm trying to get fit so I've starting cycling at lunch and stuff), which puts the Switch Neon Red & Blue, Sports & Nintendo Switch Online 12 Month Membership all in one handy package for only £249 at Currys, down from £259. Seeing as the standalone unit costs £250 all on its lonesome, this constitutes A Good Deal if you ask me. I know Nintendo is the Realm of Mario, but I've always loved a bit of Sonic the Hedgehog, and right now, there's not one, not two, but THREE Cyber Monday deals on Sonic games at Amazon. So if you, and your 8-year-old son (like mine, incidentally), are both Sonic nutters, why save $20 off one Nintendo Switch Sonic game, when you can save a combined $41.25 on three of them? I haven't played Frontiers myself, but massively enjoyed Superstars and Sonic X Shadow Generations (my kid is a big Shadow fan), so these offers all get the thumbs up from us two experts. Morning, it's Tech Reviews Editor Erlingur here, I'll be escorting you through the magical kingdom of Nintendo Switch deals for the next couple of hours. As someone who has loved Nintendo ever since encountering Super Mario and Duck Hunt with my first NES wayyyyy back in 1989, I'm looking forward to this time with you. Usually, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a frustrating hunting ground for Nintendo Switch deals (we've got a six-year track record of striving to find gems in the often-barren desert), but this year seems different, with lots and lots of great deals on consoles and games alike. And I've already spotted a verrrrry nice one... For UK Switch fans, we've been highlighting the same deal all week – this one that puts it at (currently) £228 at OnBuy. It's been changing in price a bit - the lowest we saw was £220 and it has gone up to £232 so don't be surprised to see it either sell out or get more expensive. If you'd prefer Amazon, you'll need to pay a bit extra - the OLED console is currently £274. Surprisingly for Amazon, there haven't been oodles of Switch deals on consoles. But the giant has had some great game deals, and accessories too which we will keep you posted on. WHO WILL WIN THE RACE for the lowest price? See what I did there with the Sonic image below? Great. Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle: $349 $275 at Target So. What have we got? Well, we've got a fabulous bundle deal from Target, which sets the Switch OLED at a record-low price of $275 BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. That deal has $79 of added value in the form of Mario Kart Deluxe 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online membership. So actually you're getting total savings of $144. What do you get with that membership? You get access to hundreds, yes hundreds of titles in Nintendo's back catalogue, plus some Sega titles too. I absolutely love retro games (the day they veered from platform gaming was a sad one for me, I don't have the spatial awareness) and so this is a real pull for me. If I was in the US I'd grab this deal immediately. It's in and out of stock at Target, and available in store only at best Buy. Get a taster of the game below: And we're off on yet ANOTHER Nintendo Switch live blog - our fifth year of blogging and my sixth of covering Nintendo Switch sales. I say this to let you know you're in the best possible hands here. We'll be sharing all our expert advice and insider knowledge on whether the deals you see are genuinely worth your time, and to let you know when to pull the trigger (press the mouse? trackpad? It's been a long weekend) on that deal you've been eyeing up. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that the Nintendo Switch deals we've seen this year have been the best I've ever seen during Black Friday. They're so good I was actually surprised. But they are going in and out of stock, so it's important to grab one where you can. Okay stand by and we'll get into this for real. Here's a picture of Mario as an elephant. Just because I can.

Title: Nov 30 ends rare Meta Ray-Bans deal for $149 on Amazon

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

Cyber Monday 2024 Cyber Monday Deals Cyber Monday Tech Deals Best Buy Deals Cyber Monday Apple Deals Cyber Monday Laptop Deals Cyber Monday Toy Deals Cyber Monday Coffee Deals Cyber Monday Mattress Deals Cyber Monday Outdoor Deals Cyber Monday TV Deals Cyber Monday Camera Deals Branch Cyber Monday Deals If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Cyber Monday may be over, but the deals are still going strong—for now. Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Every item on this list has been vetted, tested, and loved by someone at WIRED. Our Gear team has cross-checked these picks with our buying guides to ensure you're getting the lowest prices—or close to it. Don't wait too long, though. These prices won't stick around forever—some may already expire by the time you reach the end of this story. Jump to Category Our Process We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. To find you the best deals, we use a proprietary tool that scans prices on everything we've reviewed over the last two years and spotlights notable price changes. We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor. Check out our guide for more great gifts for travelers. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

Title: Nvidia's AI audio model, Claude's new features, and funding for AI agents: This week's AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Nvidia (NVDA) announced its new AI audio model, Fugatto, this week that can generate or transform “any mix of music, voices and sounds described with prompts using any combination of text and audio files.” Fugatto is short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, Nvidia said. With the new model, users can enter a text prompt and generate a music snippet, remove or add instruments to an already existing song, change accents or emotions in a voice, and “produce sounds never heard before.” “Fugatto is the first foundational generative AI model that showcases emergent properties — capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities — and the ability to combine free-form instructions,” Nvidia said. Anthropic announced new updates to its Claude AI chatbot this week. With the new Google (GOOGL) Docs integration, Claude can use context from a user’s documents to improve the relevance and accuracy of its responses, Anthropic said. Claude can summarize long documents and “reference historical context” from Google Docs files. The integration is available for Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. Claude’s new styles feature allows users to customize how the chatbot responds to follow a preferred communication style and work requirements. Users can choose a formal, concise, or explanatory style. Claude can also generate custom styles from uploaded sample content. Anthropic also added the ability to add global profile preferences for the chatbot to instruct it “on things you always want it to keep in mind,” such as a preferred coding language. AI agents startup /dev/agents came out of stealth mode this week and announced a $56 million seed round. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and CapitalG. The startup, which is building an operating system for AI agents, was founded by former Stripe chief technology officer David Singleton, and former vice presidents at Google and Meta (META): Hugo Barra, Ficus Kirkpatrick, and Nicholas Jitkoff. “Today you can build an AI demo in hours, but getting something consumers can actually trust with their credit card is nearly impossible,” Singleton said. “Just as Android made mobile development accessible to virtually any developer, we’re building the platform that will help make AI agents mainstream.” Runway announced its new base model for image generation, Frames, this week. The new model represents “a big step forward in stylistic control and visual fidelity,” the AI startup, which develops multimodal AI systems for video, image, and audio generation, said. Frames can maintain stylistic consistency when generating images, Runway said. Access to Frames is rolling out in its Gen-3 Alpha foundation model and through Runway’s API. Visual AI platform Luma launched its first image generation model, Luma AI Photon Image Model, this week. The text-to-image foundation model was built on Luma’s Universal Transformer architecture. The model is 800% faster and cheaper than other models, Luma said. Luma also announced a free and subscription-based service for its Dream Machine visual AI service on the web and iOS. The Dream Machine model was released in June and has 25 million registered users.

Title: Investing.com stocks of the week

Investing.com -- Despite the quieter back half of the week due to the Thanksgiving holiday, there was still plenty of action in the markets, with several names capturing investor attention. Here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Symbotic (SYM), Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Rocket Lab USA (RKLB). Symbotic shares plunged over 37% on Wednesday after the company announced it would not meet the deadline for filing its annual form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024. It cited the need to evaluate the financial impact of a significant error in its revenue recognition. The company disclosed that the error, related to cost overruns that are not billable on certain deployments, has impacted its system revenue calculations and financial results for the year. While analysts at TD Cowen maintained a Buy rating on the stock, saying the “reaction [is] likely overdone,” DA Davidson, Craig-Hallum, and KeyBanc cut the stock to Hold/Neutral following the news. Rivian made solid gains this week. On Monday, its stock closed over 13% higher after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it had reached a "conditional" settlement in its 2020 lawsuit accusing Rivian of employee poaching to steal electric-vehicle trade secrets. While Tesla did not reveal the details of the agreement, it is said to have told a California state judge that it plans to dismiss the case by December 24, provided the settlement terms are fulfilled. Rivian also announced on Monday that it had received a conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion to accelerate its growth of electric vehicle design, development, and manufacturing in the United States. Reacting to that news, analysts at Truist stated: “We view the announcement as an incremental positive for the RIVN story providing another avenue for capital alongside the Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) (VOW-GR, NR) JV, however given the timeline of the project with Phase 1 not expected to begin production until 2028, we expect the focus to remain on R2 startup at Georgia for the time being.” Rocket Lab USA shares continued to surge this week, gaining more than 18% (at the time of writing on Friday). It is currently trading around the $27.32 mark after gaining around 6.4% on Friday. The week started well for the company, with its stock jumping on the back of news it received a $23.9 million award from the U.S. Department of Commerce and completed two successful satellite launches within 24 hours. The funding, awarded under the CHIPS and Science Act, is expected to support Rocket Lab's efforts to expand compound semiconductor manufacturing at its Albuquerque, New Mexico facility. Meanwhile, the company hit a new operational milestone, successfully conducting two launches within a 24-hour period. The first was launched from its facility in Virginia, followed shortly by the “Ice AIS Baby” mission from New Zealand. This second mission placed five satellites into low Earth orbit for Kinéis, a French operator developing an Internet-of-Things satellite constellation. KeyBanc raised its target for RKLB to $27 from $12 per share, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock.

There are 300 Quest 3 games or bundles discounted on the Quest Store by our count; we've chosen 25 across genres for every VR gamer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta had discounted about 300 Quest 3 or 2 games through December 3 at 10a Pacific. That means you have through Cyber Monday to stock up on games that normally retail for $20–40, so you're liable to save $10 or more with every purchase. This Quest Store link should take you to the full list of on-sale titles, which are all 40% off with the code BFCM24. Everyone else can check their regional store for a Black Friday or Cyber Monday category. If you're still on the hunt for a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S, we've found several Cyber Monday deals that come with free gift cards or accessories! One of which includes free Meta Quest credit that can be used toward games here. Below, I've rounded up some of the best Quest games across every category, to help you narrow down that 300-game list to those that our staff has personally played and enjoyed! Or you can check out our best Quest games list for guidance — though not every game on that list is discounted. If you want to narrow down that list even further, games like Pistol Whip or Superhot are shooters that really familiarize you with VR gameplay but keep you rooted in one spot so you don't have to move around the world, avoiding any VR sickness for beginners. Games like LEGO: Bricktales or Espire 2 will let you try out mixed reality and keep an eye on your real-world surroundings, while Vacation Simulator and Walkabout Mini Golf are great cozy experiences. If you want to use VR to get fit, Creed is the obvious choice for punching and weaving, but other games like Racket: Nx and Underdogs will accidentally work you out while you're having too much fun to notice. And for the most traditional multiplayer excitement, Breachers or Contractors Showdown will feel familiar to COD fans. Many of the biggest AAA Quest games aren't eligible for the 40% discount, but I've noticed that if you click on a link for full-price games like Batman: Arkham Shadow or Assassin's Creed Nexus, you may see a 20% "Holiday promotion" pop-up (see the screenshot) for any game if you click on a third-party link. Hopefully these links will work, and you can save a little extra! Otherwise, if you're a new or current Quest 3 / Quest 3S owner, check out our guide on the best Quest 3 accessories!

Title: The BLUETTI Handsfree 2 is a solar backpack and power station — It’s $249 off

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? While you’re busy shopping through all of the Best Cyber Monday deals, here’s a little something that might pique your interest. You’ll be even more excited if you spend a lot of time outdoors or off-grid. You might want to wait on grabbing that Cyber Monday portable power station deal. Allow me to explain. The BLUETTI Handsfree 2 is a backpack, like any other outdoor pack you might encounter, except for one thing. It’s also a power station and solar generator. Believe me when I say this thing is insane and super useful. But for Cyber Monday, there’s a deal that includes the BLUETTI Handsfree 2 and a 100-watt solar panel to charge it on the go. Normally $799, it’s yours for just $599, saving you $200. Wow. You have to read what it can all do, so don’t leave just yet. At first glance, it looks like any regular outdoor or hiking backpack. It has a lot of functions that would serve you well on the trail or while camping, too. For example, there are MOLLE hangable points to hang your sleeping bag, tent, or solar panels. It has a travel essentials zone for stowing shoes, clothing, medicine, and necessities. It has a photography gear zone for lenses, cameras, and even drones. It also has the much-needed, power station zone where the power station tech is stored. Like any other power station, the integrated one can be charged via solar, auto ports, AC outlets, and generators. The solar panel that comes with it can plug right into the station, and then hang from your backpack while you travel. That entire time it powers up the station inside. The entire pack is IPX4 splash-resistant and has load-bearing belts, back panel support, waist pads, waist belts, shoulder straps, and chest straps. So, basically, it’s super comfortable and supportive everywhere it needs to be. It’s also large enough to carry everything you need for the day while you’re out hiking or camping. While all of that is incredible. What’s truly exciting to me is the Cyber Monday price. Maybe I’m alone here but saving $200 on something like this is awesome. Normally $799, it’s yours for $599. I have no idea how long this deal is going to last but I’m going to shop it myself I think. When I get my hands on one I’ll let you know what I think, but if I were you, I wouldn’t wait around for that info. The deal will be long gone by then. If the past two sultry summers taught us one thing, it’s that we never want to be without power -- for air conditioning, other appliances, and devices -- especially when we need it most. That in itself is a great reason to browse these generator deals. And right now at Amazon, you can score $150 off this Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 500 Outdoor Solar Generator. It’s down to only $500, and then there’s a coupon to get an extra $50 off its original price of $600. Never be without power again with this amazing deal. We’ve all been there: Suddenly, the lights and Wi-Fi go out, the TV goes off, and you’re powerless to do anything. Blackouts are a fact of life, but you never need to be without power again with the Portable Power Station Explorer 500 Outdoor Solar Generator from Jackery. It can not only provide important power during blackouts, but it’s incredibly helpful for camping trips and any outdoor activities far from a power source. This is a household essential that you can’t do without, and at this price, there’s no reason not to grab it. A “20% off sitewide” banner on top of a company’s website should normally be cause for glee among customers. Except if you’re a fan of that company’s products and its executives remain silent amid mounting signs that said company might be on the brink of bankruptcy.That’s what’s happening with Juiced Bikes, the San Diego-based maker of e-bikes.According to numerous customer reports, Juiced Bikes has completely stopped responding to customer inquiries for some time, while its website is out of stock on all products. There are also numerous testimonies of layoffs at the company.Even more worrying signs are also piling up: The company’s assets, including its existing inventory of products, is appearing as listed for sale on an auction website used by companies that go out of business.In addition, a court case has been filed in New York against parent company Juiced Inc. and Juiced Bike founder Tora Harris, according to Trellis, a state trial court legal research platform.Founded in 2009 by Harris, a U.S. high-jump Olympian, Juiced Bikes was one of the early pioneers of the direct-to-consumer e-bike brands in the U.S. market.The company’s e-bikes developed a loyal fandom through the years. Last year, Digital Trends named the Juiced Bikes Scorpion X2 as the best moped-style e-bike for 2023, citing its versatility, rich feature set, and performance.The company has so far stayed silent amid all the reports. But should its bankruptcy be confirmed, it could legitimately be attributed to the post-pandemic whiplash experienced by the e-bike industry over the past few years. The Covid-19 pandemic had led to a huge spike in demand for e-bikes just as supply chains became heavily constrained. This led to a ramp-up of e-bike production to match the high demand. But when consumer demand dropped after the pandemic, e-bike makers were left with large stock surpluses.The good news is that the downturn phase might soon be over just as the industry is experiencing a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to a report by Houlihan Lokey.This may mean that even if Juiced Bikes is indeed going under, the brand and its products might find a buyer and show up again on streets and trails. If you've been on the internet and seen a bunch of pressure washer clips and are now considering grabbing one yourself, you'll be happy to know that there is a huge range of them to pick from. That includes some great budget-oriented versions to dip your toe in and are still good for cleaning stains and cleaning up stuff. That's why we've gone out and collected some of our favorite washer deals for you below, including some of the best pressure washers for cars, which you do have to be a bit careful with not to strip the paint or clearcoat. Greenworks Pressure Washer Combo Kit -- $110 $220 50% off While this Greenworks power washer doesn't have as high a PSI, around 1,900 PSI, it is a lot more portable and a great option if you want something that's smaller and easier to take around with you. It comes with a 35-foot power chord and a 20-foot hose, so you get quite a bit of distance. If you are somewhere rural and need to clean stuff that doesn't have a power cable nearby, this is perfect. Besides that, we also appreciate that this comes with an 11-inch surface cleaner, which isn't something common with a lot of other power washers, even more expensive ones. Just be aware that you do need a My Best Buy subscription to be able to get the discount.

Title: This KIWI design Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessory adds 2.5 hours to your playtime

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Two of the biggest gripes I have with my family’s new Meta Quest 3S — if you can really call them that — can be solved in one go, with a pretty useful accessory. First, the stock head strap is uncomfortable and I wish the battery life were just a little better. Well, KIWI Design has a Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessory that fixes both of those quirks. The K4 Boost comfort strap also includes a built-in battery that adds an extra 2.5 hours of playtime. It’s more comfortable to wear, too. But here’s the best part: It’s only $40 in a Cyber Monday deal. Normally $70, that saves you $30. And don’t fret if you think you missed out on the best Cyber Monday deals, many of them are still available to shop, like this one. The KIWI Design K4 Boost is both a comfort-oriented strap and a battery life extender thanks to a built-in battery. You get an extra 2.5 to 3 hours of wireless playtime while it’s charged. Moreover, it supports dual fast charging so both the battery and the Quest unit charge with minimal delays. One of the more useful features of this headstrap is the adjustment system. You can easily take the Meta Quest 3 or 3S off, readjust the strap, and put it back on. That also goes for swapping players, which can be a tad frustrating when you’re using the stock strap. That’s because on the KIWI straps you use a rear-mounted dial that’s as simple as twisting a knob. You put the headset on, twist the knob to tighten the strap and that’s it. It’s super simple and you’ll be amazed at how fast and how well it works. I was too. You don’t have to worry about the strap adding too much weight to the whole setup either. Even with the battery, it’s relatively light at 0.8 pounds. That still gives you plenty of maneuverability while wearing the headset. Anything that would bog down the set and your head would make moving around more difficult. That’s certainly not the case here. Plus, a little added weight is a decent trade-off for more playtime. I’ve noticed during use that my family burns through the battery pretty fast, especially while playing some Beat Saber. For Cyber Monday, the price of the KIWI Design K4 Boost headset is now $40, normally $70. That’s a great offer on a fantastic Meta Quest 3 and 3s accessory. Connections is one of the best puzzle games from the New York Times. The game tasks you with categorizing a pool of 16 words into four secret (for now) groups by figuring out how the words relate to each other. The puzzle resets every night at midnight and each new puzzle has a varying degree of difficulty. Just like Wordle, you can keep track of your winning streak and compare your scores with friends. Some days are trickier than others — just like other NYT Games favorites The Mini and Strands. If you're having a little trouble solving today's puzzle, check out our Connections tips and tricks guide for some good strategies or check out the hints for today's Connections puzzle below. And if you still can't get it, we'll tell you today's answers at the very end. How to play Connections Strands is a brand new daily puzzle from the New York Times. A trickier take on the classic word search, you'll need a keen eye to solve this puzzle. Like Wordle, Connections, and the Mini Crossword, Strands can be a bit difficult to solve some days. There's no shame in needing a little help from time to time. If you're stuck and need to know the answers to today's Strands puzzle, check out the solved puzzle below. How to play Strands You start every Strands puzzle with the goal of finding the "theme words" hidden in the grid of letters. Manipulate letters by dragging or tapping to craft words; double-tap the final letter to confirm. If you find the correct word, the letters will be highlighted blue and will no longer be selectable. Love crossword puzzles but don't have all day to sit and solve a full-sized puzzle in your daily newspaper? That's what The Mini is for! A bite-sized version of the New York Times' well-known crossword puzzle, The Mini is a quick and easy way to test your crossword skills daily in a lot less time (the average puzzle takes most players just over a minute to solve). While The Mini is smaller and simpler than a normal crossword, it isn't always easy. Tripping up on one clue can be the difference between a personal best completion time and an embarrassing solve attempt.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Here's a juicy bit of tech history: Back in 2013, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) legendary founder Morris Chang asked Nvidia's (NVDA) Jensen Huang to take over as CEO. It wasn't just a casual pitch. Chang laid out a 10-minute vision for Taiwan Semiconductor's future, convinced Huang's industry smarts and leadership chops made him the perfect successor. But Huang? He shut it down, quick, with a polite, I already have a job. That job, of course, was running Nvidia. And oh, how that decision paid off. Nvidia exploded into the AI juggernaut it is today, while Taiwan Semiconductor thrived under new leadership, cementing itself as the chipmaking kingpin for giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with TSM. This moment is more than just a fun anecdoteit's a masterclass in leadership and strategy. Huang's decision to stick with Nvidia wasn't just loyalty; it was foresight. By doubling down on Nvidia's potential, he steered the company to a $1 trillion market cap, driven by insatiable AI demand. Meanwhile, Chang's knack for partnerships and market positioning turned Taiwan Semiconductor into the semiconductor backbone of the digital economy. It's no coincidence these two companies remain tethered, with Taiwan Semiconductor producing Nvidia's cutting-edge chips. Their trajectories highlight the power of staying the course and playing to your strengthsa lesson Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is now trying to catch up on as it chases the foundry crown. For investors, this is a clear signal: Leadership decisions aren't just boardroom dramathey're market movers. Chang and Huang's mutual respect and strategic brilliance laid the groundwork for today's AI and semiconductor boom. Nvidia's rise in AI and Taiwan Semiconductor's dominance in chipmaking didn't happen by luckit happened because of visionary calls like these. The takeaway? Bet on the leaders who see not just the game ahead but the game-changing partnerships that will take them there. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: This headstrap can add comfort and battery to your Meta Quest 3 this Black Friday

KIWI's leather cushioning will ease your headache woes When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3 and 3S are practical little devices for VR gaming, but their head straps are, not to be too mean, a little basic. Don't get me wrong, the clever tightening loops that slide along the back side are nice and easy to adjust, but if you were hoping for any cushioning at all, you may be left wanting. That's okay though because if you've been struggling to play for longer sessions with the Quest 3 or Quest 3S, there are third-party head straps that could absolutely change the game for you, as they did me. KIWI Design is my favorite, and in a special Black Friday treat, it's offering both its battery and comfort head straps for less. If you don't care too much about battery life, the Comfort Head Strap is going for just $19.99 at Amazon at the moment, which is the cheapest I've ever seen it drop to, and I track its price on a weekly basis. Black Friday Meta Quest deals like this can offer you the chance to boost the quality of life of your headset, even if the 3 and 3S devices aren't discounted in their own rights. If you've got a bit more money to play around with, you may be more interested in KIWI's battery-boosting option, which gives you the same plush comfort, but also gives your headset a longer lifespan. It's currently going for $39.79 at Amazon. KIWI Design Comfort Head Strap for Quest 3 / 3S | $39.99 $19.99 at AmazonSave $29 - Now, unfortunately, this is a Prime-exclusive deal, which means if you're not a paying member, you could take out a free trial and cancel before it takes any money away from you. Also, don't forget to tick the $10 coupon box on the retail page to get the full saving. Buy it if: ✅ You find the stock head strap uncomfortable✅ You like plush cushioning✅ You want something designed by a Meta partner Don't buy it if: ❌ You're hoping to use this with another VR headset❌ You want the Battery pack version UK: £25.49 at Amazon There's a lot to like about KIWI's Comfort head straps, and since testing one out with the Meta Quest 3, it's the only one I use. It should be noted that if you have the Meta Quest 3S, KIWI's straps will work with your device too. Thankfully, the designs of the two headsets are similar enough that they can make use of the same Meta Quest accessories. The comfort level of the KIWI Battery head strap really surprised me, because, for a cheaper add-on by a third-party brand, it feels extremely premium. It's got really plush cushioning that hugs your noggin while you play, and the leather material feels nice and genuine - I haven't noted any degradation or peeling that would point to a cheaper substitute being used. The battery version is particularly useful and has added many hours to my Blade & Sorcery survival mode runs. Whiling away the hours slaughtering NPCs has never been easier, and if anything, KIWI's head straps are responsible for the countless virtual lives I've taken in increasingly brutal ways. Luckily, it braces my head really gently thanks to its adjustable length, and I never feel that forehead ache like I sometimes can with the stock head strap. If there's one issue with this best Meta Quest accessory, it's maybe that it makes the headset feel as though it's sitting higher up on your head, and a little less secure when playing more active games. If you use the Quest 3 for a lot of fitness apps, maybe look for something more slimline, but I'm sure it wouldn't be a deal breaker and you could find the right fit for you and your use cases. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Don't forget there are also Black Friday VR headset deals running, as well as Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday gaming chair deals. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote Holy Black Friday Batman - this Meta Quest 3 deal comes with a $75 online gift card PSVR 2 is cheaper than the Quest 3S right now, and I know which one I'd buy this Black Friday Creature Commandos star Frank Grillo thinks we’ll get a season 2 of the new DC show "unless something goes terribly awry" GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing. Featuring a sumptuous sherpa collar, an asymmetrical closure, and a soft leather construction, this trend-forward jacket will keep you warm all season long, sans sacrificing style. With 700-fill power, responsibly-sourced goose down, a water-repellent and wind-resistant fabric, and a removable hood, this cropped puffer will keep you warm all through winter. It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown. This effortlessly cool mini skirt stands out for its functional cargo pockets and stretchy cotton moleskin fabric—and it looks equally great paired with a graphic tee or sweater as it does with a blouse and tights. These size-inclusive jeans are available in petite and tall lengths and have an extra two inches in the hips to create an easy-going, flattering fit. While some styles of Bonobos’ classic chinos aren’t on sale, these refined brushed twill chinos in a range of seasonal colors are up for grabs. They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort. L.L.Bean's shearling-lined 10-inch boots are the warmest of the bunch, but any of the Bean Boots will serve you well through both fall and winter, and they go with most outfits. The boot that made L.L.Bean a household name. These boots are designed to keep feet dry, warm, and comfortable in rain, mud, and other wet conditions. As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion. The coziest version of the cult-favorite belt bag, this fleecy material adds a comfy, lived-in feel to any winter outfit. The Mini Bow Bag is one of our favorite all-occasion bags for its versatility. It's equally at home at a formal event or a day on the town, and you can carry it as a top-handle bag, over-the-shoulder, or cross-body. This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a trade-in for $5/month for 36 months (three years), which amounts to $180. The deal requires the Unlimited Ultimate plan for the line that's using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you switch phones before the 36 months period, you'll have to pay off the remaining balance of phone.

We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month.

We've spotlighted The Ultra Puffer in our round up of the best Abercrombie Cyber Monday deals because it's a lookalike to Aritzia's SuperPuff and only costs $120 (plus, you can get it for an extra 15% off with the code CYBERAF). "It's a bit puffy, but that's balanced nicely by the short silhouette and faux fur accents," writes freelance author Talia Ergas. "The hood is detachable, which gives me two looks in one. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out." Find more outerwear at a discount in our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals on women's winter coats. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Title: I recommend Meta Ray-Bans over AirPods Pro as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

We have now updated our massive collection of Black Friday deals, the Google sale is already live, and Samsung is in full swing, but there’s even more we want to bring to your attention. Firstly, Backbone One USB-C – one of the best Android mobile game controllers – is now seeing solid price drops, but we also have Samsung’s originally $600 34-inch Odyssey G5 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor at just $265 as well. A fresh collection of Google Nest deals are also live – Nest Doorbell and cameras are now now up to $100 off – and we have some seriously notable deals on ultra-affordable A9+ and S6 Samsung Galaxy tabs from $149. Everything else awaits below. If you’re looking for a super affordable 2024 tablet for casual browsing, video chatting, or even something for the whole fam, the Amazon Black Friday sale is now offering Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Android tablet down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $330, this is $130 off, $30 below the early Black Friday sale price, and within $0.50 of the lowest we have ever tracked. This is easily one of the most notable deals we have tracked since its release back in April and among the most affordable Samsung tablets we have seen to date that actually ships with the S Pen in the box. It is worth noting that the Galaxy Tab S6 comes in at roughly $50 more than the Black Friday deal we are tracking on the brand’s other ultra-affordable tab, the Galaxy Tab A9+ at $149 shipped. However, as alluded to above, the S6 is a more complete experience with slightly better specs and includes the Samsung S Pen so you can sketch and doodle away without spending any more money. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: The Google Black Friday sale is now live, we are tracking the very first price drop on the all-new Google Nest Learning Thermostat 4th Gen, and now it’s time to take a look at the rest of this year’s Google Nest Black Friday offers. Alongside the new smart thermostat deal, we are also tracking price drops on the latest Nest Cam Outdoor or Indoor Battery model as well as the wired indoor variants and the Google Nest Doorbell down at $99.98 shipped in all colorways. This includes both the wireless and the wired options for folks looking to integrate the smart video doorbell into an existing chime and power system. Everything you need to know about the all-time low now live on the brand new Google Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) is waiting right here. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday deals, Amazon is offering one of the best gaming monitor deals by dropping Samsung’s 34-inch Odyssey G55T 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor to $265.04 shipped. This originally $600 gaming display has fetched as much as $500 in recent months, but it has mostly been sitting at the $380 mark. We saw it drop to $300 over a month ago in September, but today’s Black Friday deal at Amazon lands it $35 below that price to mark a new all-time low. This is easily one of the best gaming monitor deals we’ve tracked over the last few weeks for Black Friday, and you can learn more about this model below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

Title: What's Happening With Super Micro Stock?

Time Published: 2024-11-29T16:30:05Z

POLAND - 2024/11/15: In this photo illustration, a Super Micro logo is displayed on a smartphone ... [+] with stock market percentages in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Server maker Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) extended its recent rally, gaining close to 30% over the last five trading days. The stock now trades at $35 per share, up about 2x from recent lows seen around mid-November, when investors were concerned about the company’s potential delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. Last week, the company said that it had hired BDO as its public auditor, replacing Ernst & Young, who resigned in October after it raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. With the new public auditor on board, Super Micro is expected to gain additional time to avoid delisting from Nasdaq as it works to file its overdue 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 2024 and its September quarter report. Separately, see how Disney may be undervalued in Disney Stock To 2x? Looking over a longer period, SMCI stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now even considering the strong historical performance and the recent rally, SMCI stock is still down by a massive 70% from its all-time highs earlier this year. The stock also trades at just about 9x projected 2025 earnings. However, jumping into SMCI stock might not be a wise move just yet, in our view. Here’s why. Significant risks remain for Super Micro. The company’s new auditor will have to rework its financial statements and this process will likely take time. Super Micro has only indicated in filings that it plans to submit its overdue financial reports, but has not provided a specific timeline. Separately, earlier this week, the company announced it had prepaid borrowings from Bank of America and Cathay Bank. Some of the debt had covenants that required the company to file its FY 2024 and most recent quarterly financial statements by December 31. On the upside, by fully prepaying these loans, SMCI has eliminated the need to meet this reporting deadline. On the downside, this could also signal that there could be further delays in filing its audited accounts. Now, Super Micro Computer has been a big winner in the generative AI space, as demand for its server systems surged as companies looked to deploy the latest GPUs using the company’s server solutions. Revenues more than doubled in FY’24, with consensus estimates pointing to an additional 80% increase for the current fiscal year. However, the AI growth story doesn’t compensate for the company’s corporate governance concerns and questions about its financial reporting. Want to profit from shifts in the AI market? Consider this trade Sell Nvidia, Buy AMD Stock The company’s recent troubles began in August after short-seller Hindenburg Research pointed to multiple red flags in the company’s accounting practices. Further, The Wall Street Journal reported in late September that the U.S. Justice Department may be probing the company, although the investigation was reportedly in its early stages at the time. The company’s history of delayed reports and concerns raised by various parties doesn’t exactly inspire trust. Even if the company’s valuation looks reasonable today, issues with internal controls and accounting practices may impact its long-term viability and ability to deliver shareholder value. It also remains to be seen if the new auditor will indeed sign off on the company’s accounts. Given these risks, it’s probably best to exercise caution with SMCI stock until there are signs that the company’s core accounting issues have been be resolved.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rocket Lab USA (RKLB, Financial) reached its highest level at $27.5 per share on November 29, 2024 after recorded a single-day gain of 8.3%. This reflects an impressive 398% year to date return, fueled by increased investor risk appetite and a vibrant market environment. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $13.5 billion, with expected annual revenue growth of 77%. Some financial highlights include the third quarter of 2024 revenues of $105 million, 55% more than a year earlier. So, in Q4, Rocket Lab's projected revenues are $125-$135 million and gross margins of 26-28%. Further, expanding the company's growth narrative, the company has been awarded a $23.9 million grant following the recent signing of the CHIPS Act to advance to increase semiconductor production in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The aerospace businesses also started their growth with this company. Its Neutron rocket went through the qualification process and secured the first commercial order. This is well aligned with Rocket Lab's current Electron rocket, which will be instrumental in this firm. Wall Street has paid attention, adjusting price targets for the Company BofA Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen to show a hopeful forward for Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab's progress includes building and launching the Neutron rocket while achieving notable milestones. The company has accomplished two launches in under 24 hours and secured a multi-launch deal for its Neutron lander. It has achieved these milestones by demonstrating its position as a responsive space solutions provider and a comprehensive aerospace solutions and services company.?

(@Metaplanet_JP) November 28, 2024 “The majority of the funds raised this time will be strategically allocated for the purchase of additional Bitcoin,” the notice reads. “We have made it clear that we intend to utilize debt and periodic stock issuance to systematically increase our Bitcoin holdings while reducing exposure to a depreciating yen.” Metaplanet further highlighted that Bitcoin’s “prominence continues to grow” after it nearly hit $100,000 earlier this month. On the other hand, “the Japanese yen continues to depreciate, with the USD/JPY exchange rate returning to the 154 level on the same day, presenting ongoing concerns.” “Given these circumstances, we recognize the urgent importance of increasing our Bitcoin holdings and have therefore decided to proceed with this fundraising initiative,” the company concluded. The stock acquisition still needs approval by local regulators under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If approved, the operation will take place from Dec. 16, 2024 until June 16, 2025. At the current price of about $98,000 per Bitcoin, the company would acquire over 638 BTC with the proceedings of the deal. Metaplanet also said that it had decided to put aside its “metaverse related businesses plans” since “there is still no prospect of profitability, and has decided to incorporate the purchase and holding of Bitcoin as part of our stated corporate treasury strategy.” The comments follow public disappointment with the results of the metaverse under development by Meta (formally Facebook) following a $177 billion investment by the company by the summer of 2022. As Decrypt reported at the time, the platforms' graphics being heralded as at the forefront of the metaverse look about the same—if not worse—than the 20-year-old virtual world Second Life. In its acquisition of Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, Metaplanet is following in the footsteps of U.S. business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which under the direction of its chairman Michael Saylor has pursued an aggressive strategy of Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy now holds well over 1% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply, while Saylor has touted his “Bitcoin playbook” to a number of firms, including Tesla and more recently Microsoft. Still, after seeing renewed interest at the start of the current crypto bull run, MicroStrategy’s stock took a 16% dive just as Bitcoin was approaching $100,000. At the time, one analyst explained why their firm took a short position on MicroStrategy while being long on Bitcoin.

Title: Conor McGregor Inc: the fighter’s potential losses in the fallout from civil rape case are enormous

Time Published: 2024-11-29T15:04:38Z
Full Content:
When a High Court jury found against Conor McGregor in his civil rape case last week, the Hollywood Reporter jumped on the story of his legal woes. The coverage in the US film industry’s go-to news publication was as big a sign as any of McGregor’s seemingly unstoppable journey into the ritzy world of entertainment from the bloodied mixed martial arts octagon. Now he is counting the cost of what he did on that December 2018 day in the penthouse suite of the Beacon Hotel in Sandyford, south Dublin. His potential losses in the fallout from the case are enormous. This was shaping up to a big year for McGregor. But that was before Nikita Hand told a believing jury of a terrifying sexual assault by a professional fighter who “would not take no for an answer”. The Dublin woman was awarded nearly €250,000 in damages after the jury found that she was raped by McGregor in the Dublin hotel in December 2018. McGregor (36) owns three Dublin pubs: the Black Forge Inn and the Marble Arch in Drimnagh, and the Waterside in Howth, where plans for a boutique hotel were rejected by Fingal County Council. But he always wanted to stride on a bigger stage – and did so with alacrity. [ Conor McGregor was facilitated by a culture of entitlement and cheered on by adoring fansOpens in new window ] He made his Hollywood debut in March, starring in the move Road House with A-list actor Jake Gyllenhaal. In June he struck a new deal to use his image in the Hitman video game, a global franchise. He continued to promote Proper No. Twelve, the whiskey brand he sold three years ago for $130 million (€123 million) and was on a drive to create international markets for his Forged Stout brand. The sales slogan said much about his ambition for the new brew: “Better watch out, because we’re not here to take part, we’re here to take over.” It echoes McGregor’s famous line from his post-fight octagon interview at UFC Fight Night Dublin in 2014, when he was at the vanguard of a number of Irish fighters appearing on the promotion. Now it is events that have taken over, threatening an empire that traded on McGregor’s ability to connect directly with a certain cohort of young men with an almost cult-like appeal. Ms Hand’s account of how McGregor “brutally raped and battered her” has dealt a crippling blow to his earning power. Retailers are taking McGregor drink from their shelves – and his image has been pulled from whiskey marketing and video games. His childhood soccer team in Crumlin, Lourdes Celtic, is said locally to be removing his name from players’ kit but the club itself did not reply to questions. Even the National Wax Museum has removed his sculpture. Forged Stout was sold in off-licences and supermarkets and a relatively small number of pubs so the delisting inflicts financial pain. However, for the McGregor brand the real money was in the US. There could be serious implications there too. “Financially, and then [in terms of] future revenue generating, it’s very damaging for him,” said Prof Norm O’Reilly, author of 20 books on sports sponsorship and dean of the University of New England business school. “I would say for most brands this is now like a hands-off, certainly in the very short term. It doesn’t look good. It’s about images. Image transfer is the core of why sponsorship works. He added: “If you and I own a company and we’re trying to be a little edgy, he’s no longer our choice, right?” There are “many other athletes out there who have a bit of edge” but who haven’t “done something like this to women”, said Prof O’Reilly. McGregor was in full plumage when he claimed to be “the highest-paid first-time actor of all time” for his villain role in Road House, an action thriller remake of a 1980s blockbuster that starred the late Patrick Swayze. He is said to have received $5 million for the role, prompting his claim to have been paid more than wrestler-turned Hollywood star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson when he burst on to the screen decades ago. Nikita Hand has won her civil case against MMA fighter Conor McGregor. The 35 year-old Dublin woman alleged he raped her in the penthouse suite of The Beacon Hotel in December 2018. The jury, believing her account of assault, found in her favour; returning a verdict yesterday evening after six hours of deliberations. McGregor has been ordered to pay Ms. Hand almost €250,000 in damages. But why has the UFC fighter not been found guilty of rape? How has Ms. Hand successfully sued him in the High Court? And what did the jury hear to persuade them she was the one telling the truth. Frank Greaney is courts correspondent for the Bauer Media group, which owns radio stations including Newstalk and TodayFM. He explains how Nikita Hand faced down McGregor at great personal cost. Please be advised this episode contains details of sexual assault, which some listeners may find distressing.Produced and presented by Aideen Finnegan. Johnson is now a superstar. Any hopes of McGregor to follow him or Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder-turned movie star-turned politician, must be measured against the jury’s verdict. Despite the boycott, Road House remains on Amazon Prime’s streaming service. The company had nothing to say about McGregor. “We’re not offering any comment,” Amazon Prime said. McGregor’s Hollywood agent, Audie Attar, did not reply to questions. Similarly, his London-based spokeswoman did not respond to queries. These included the question of whether McGregor was contractually bound to repay fees in the event of adverse court findings. “Those are pretty common in contracts now if this [behaviour] is over a line that the brands wanted,” Prof O’Reilly said. The business meltdown started on Monday when IO Interactive, Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, cut ties with the fighter. “In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” the company said. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr McGregor from our storefronts starting today.” IO Interactive did not respond to further questions. Yet it is clear the company had high hopes for a Hitman game with a “mysterious Disruptor featuring global superstar Conor McGregor”. At the time IO Interactive said it was “beyond thrilled” to work with the fighter, citing his “raw charisma and energy”. McGregor said he had “a lot of fun creating the character and bringing him to life”. All of that has now ended. The Irish response was less immediate, coming two days after Rape Crisis Network Ireland urged retailers to stop selling McGregor stout and the whiskey brand he sold to Mexican group Proximo Spirits in 2021. But the dam broke just before lunchtime on Tuesday when Barry Group, owner of Costcutter stores and Carry Out off-licences, became the first to drop Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey, saying: “This action reflects our commitment to maintaining a retail environment that resonates with the values of our customers and partners.” [ More than 1,000 shops including Tesco, SuperValu and Centra stores remove brands linked to Conor McGregorOpens in new window ] Musgrave, owner of the Supervalu and Centra chains, quickly followed. So too did wholesaler BWG, saying it will no longer distribute McGregor-linked brands to Spar, Eurospar, Mace, Londis and XL stores. BWG’s decision removed product from 1,000 outlets. Bigger still was Tesco’s move to delist McGregor brands from more than 4,200 Irish and UK stores and its online shop. Then came the response of Proximo, the Mexican owner of Bushmills Irish whiskey and Tequila which made a big bet on Proper No. Twelve in 2021: “Going forward, we do not plan to use Mr McGregor’s name and likeness in the marketing of the brand.” The properwhiskey.com website was soon offline. The bad news kept coming. Retailer Asda dropped Forged Stout from 500 UK stores on Thursday. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon cut the product from seven Irish pubs. Off-licence chain O’Brien’s cut both stout and whiskey, as did State airport group DAA. Manchester-based LWC, the UK’s largest independent drinks wholesaler, also cut ties with McGregor, saying it had taken the “necessary legal steps” to end distribution of his stout. [ From the very start Conor McGregor was telling us and showing us who he wasOpens in new window ] “We are consulting with our customers to support them in the replacement of Forged draught taps. LWC does not want to be associated with Conor McGregor or Forged Irish Stout.” The irony is that McGregor’s “notorious” image once gave business something akin to a golden ticket into the world of young men. Research in 2016 by a sports consultancy then known PSG Sponsorship showed he was the athlete most admired by almost one-in-three Irish people aged 18-34. He was less popular with older people. But the nationwide poll of 1,000 people reflected McGregor’s meteoric rise, placing him ahead of boxer Katie Taylor, rowers Gary and Paul O’Donovan, jockey Ruby Walsh, rugby star Johnny Sexton and soccer player Robbie Keane. He was sixth most popular only two years earlier. Although this carried immense business appeal, the accounts of McGregor’s main Dublin company give little insight into his overall fortune. Abridged financial statements filed on Monday for McGregor Sports and Entertainment Ltd show profits fell in 2023 to €194,297 from €528,263 the previous year, with accumulated profits at €506,475. No longer is the image positive, it’s negative ... now the brand senses a problem McGregor’s returns from the $130 million Proximo deal and the $100 million he reportedly received for a Las Vegas boxing defeat in 2017 to Floyd Mayweather seem to be elsewhere. The money came on top of the tens of millions of dollars he earned from his UFC fight career. Business magazine Forbes listed him as the world’s highest-paid athlete in 2021, behind football stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with salary/winnings of $22 million and endorsements of $158 million. For as long as it lasted, business was fully behind McGregor’s macho personality. “Only a very, very few athletes have properties that reach the kind of markets he does,” said Prof O’Reilly. “He’s kind of on the edge but he’s never really gone over the edge.” That changed with the High Court verdict, no matter that these were civil and not criminal proceedings. “So, no longer is the image positive, it’s negative. So now the brand senses a problem,” said Prof O’Reilly. Right now, McGregor is short on supporters. But one man who has leapt to his defence is Roger Stone, acolyte of incoming US president Donald Trump and a Republican Party activist going back to the time of Richard Nixon. In a bizarre claim, Stone contended in a message to McGregor on X that the allegations against him stemmed from the fighter “telling the truth about how they are trying to destroy free speech in your country”. “Don’t give up. Keep fighting for the Ireland you love. God bless you,” Stone told him in the social media post. Stone’s intervention was in line with dismissive response of the Make America Great Again movement to court findings against Trump. Still, this was a world away from the mass-market allure that McGregor cultivated. Only weeks have passed since a Netflix boxing match yielded a $20 million pay-day for Mike Tyson, who served a prison term for rape in 1990s. Asked whether this showed McGregor could find a way back, Prof O’Reilly said Tyson’s appeal was at the box office, not in sponsorship. Mixed martial arts sponsors may stay with McGregor but “they’re very small”, he said. The bigger potential loss was from sponsors not directly linked to fighting. Citing Tiger Woods’ loss of non-golf sponsors after the exposure of his marital infidelity, Prof O’Reilly said: “It’s literally cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.” McGregor will appeal the court findings but the strain on his business interests could hardly be greater. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Learn more Whether you're a gamer or know one yourself, Cyber Monday's gaming deals are worth checking out for upgrading your devices and curating gifts. However, we recommend you snag them fast since the best Cyber Monday gaming deals are likely going to expire after today. Gaming consoles, Switch accessories, and PC peripherals are all on sale for all-time low prices. The highly-coveted PS5 Digital Edition is $75 off. Meanwhile, you can save $50 on the Xbox Series X Digital Edition. PC gamers can also secure deep discounts on powerful gaming laptops, like this Dell system with an Intel Core i9 and RTX 4070 for $200 off. Find the best Cyber Monday gaming deals on products we recommend below. If you're gift shopping, check out our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals for sales across all categories, including home, kitchen, tech, and more. For Cyber Monday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle was available for $50 off, but that deal sold out. However, even at full price the bundle still saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and membership separately. This bundle includes a standard Nintendo Switch console, a download code for Mario Kart 8, and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch online. Even at full price, this package already saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and subscription separately. Highlights Inspired by Nintendo's popular Legend of Zelda franchise, this bundle includes a gold-colored Switch Lite console and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch Online. The typical combined price of both items would be $250, so this bundle saves you around $40. The 8BitDo Ultimate is comfortable, highly customizable, and comes with a convenient charging dock. The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch is a full-sized gamepad that offers bigger buttons, better joysticks, and extra customizable buttons. The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Cyber Monday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Walmart. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Cyber Monday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low of $374. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games. This model includes a disc drive and some free Fortnite content, like in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. You can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription for a total of $299. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Cyber Monday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This model of the X16 R2 by Asus has powerful specs to run almost any demanding game at high frames-per-second on its large 16-inch QHD 240Hz display. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Cyber Monday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful, and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: How did Nvidia expand nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years?

Good morning! Hallam Bullock here, once again writing to you from London. Black Friday is upon us and Business Insider's Reviews team has rounded up the best deals on the products and brands they swear by. In today's newsletter, we're looking at how Nvidia expanded nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A few years ago, Nvidia was largely unknown. It's difficult to believe, considering the company can now boast about back-to-back earnings beats, a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and a stock price that has climbed nearly 200% over the past 12 months — Citi analysts also recently eyed a catalyst that could push the stock a further 27% by January. So, how can a company grow so much, so quickly? The data behind the evolution of Nvidia's workforce tells the story, BI's Emma Cosgrove writes. Nvidia's workforce has grown nearly 20-fold since 2003. Beyond its historic rise in market value, this growth has been aided by a slew of employee incentives, including a futuristic headquarters that reflects the company's "no barriers and no boundaries" philosophy (it's easy to see why they named the building "Voyager"). This workforce growth continued through 2024, a particularly brutal year for the Tech industry, during which time Meta and Google made significant cuts. It's one of the best-paying firms in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Microsoft's median employee salary was nearly $20,000 higher than a Nvidia worker. As of January 2024, Nvidia's median salary (excluding the CEO) had surpassed Microsoft and reached more than $220,000. As the above chart illustrates, it's also left other tech giants in the dust. Nvidia's revenue per employee has recovered after years of investment. The company's revenue-to-headcount ratio showed a downward trend from 2003 until 2014, and then steady upward progress until the AI boom in 2023. During that year, this ratio doubled. This is in part due to early investment in building a programming software layer called CUDA — the main element that keeps AI builders from easily switching to competing hardware. However, the company isn't as far ahead in other areas. Gender representation in the company's workforce and the semiconductor industry as a whole has remained relatively unchanged in the last decade, Emma writes.

Major difference with Marandi above. Marandi before had stressed that Iran had had to hold its fire while Gaza ceasefire talks were on so as not to be charged with being a spoiler. The US has played up the idea that Gaza ceasefire talks are again on after the Lebanon ceasefire. So those may need to die out before Iran strikes again.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023. Compared to the dollar, it has reached lows not seen since mid-March 2022. It's currently trading at 108.1 rubles per USD.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Does one want a “chastened” NATO either? For whom egos could well be strategic assets? Rump Ukraine > Occupied Rump Ukraine. Who cares how they decorate? If they get testy, Russia just goes Grozny and rewilds Galicia. The next generation of Russian soldiers could use a boogeyman that isn’t actually dropping bombs on them at bedtime, also cold war economy go brrrrtttt. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them!

A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada.

Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W).

See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Is there any evidence for that belief? “Xi sits in Beijing. In Moscow, Putin. In Washington, Trump is on the way. You can call them crazy guys. They don’t want good. Hope lies with von der Leyen in Brussels.” Absurd and offensive.

But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

Organic whole bean coffee here has gone up about 50% over the last couple years, bagged or bulk, across the board. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based. On checking novel’s origin , some stats in storyline: Set in mid 1999-New Years day 2000, World population ~7B (seemingly indicative of extreme overpopulation!) and NYC 34M. Food shortage driven by resource hoarding by rich is a major factor in social upheaval . Euthanasia becomes a protein source… Never gonna Happen! Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions. By Stephen Castle [ Seemingly explaining why Labour has shown no legislative interest in strengthening the public health service. No wonder why Jeremy Corbyn had to be expelled from Labour. ] It seems that rational people with increasingly painful, progressive and handicapping chronic illnesses which are not in themselves terminal will still be forced to commit suicide without the support of friends or family. Seems that Parliament is addicted to short measure The British legislation may be a first step. In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday. The support is greatest among those over 55. re: Oreshnik orbital weapon as explained by the villain in “G.I.

A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun!

Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC.

Title: Amazon employees are ‘rage-applying’ as its return-to-office mandate looms—experts say that’s exactly what CEO Andy Jassy wants
URL: https://fortune.com/article/amazon-return-to-office-rto-ceo-andy-jassy-layoffs/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T10:46:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced in September, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them: that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate. These “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether. “It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg. The sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties. Amazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere. “You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.” A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on October 2, 2024. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon employees are ‘rage-applying’ as its return-to-office mandate looms—experts say that’s exactly what CEO Andy Jassy wants

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced in September, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them: that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. "Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation," Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate.

Intel said on Wednesday its deal for $7.86 billion in U.S. government subsidies restricts the company's ability to sell stakes in its chipmaking unit if it becomes an independent entity. The U.S. Commerce Department announced the subsidy to Intel on Tuesday, part of $39 billion for the sector including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and others in an effort to revitalize chip manufacturing in the United States. Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger in September said that the company planned to spin its chip manufacturing operations into a subsidiary and was open to taking on outside investors in the unit, called Intel Foundry.

LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell on Friday, heading for a weekly drop of more than 3%, pressured by easing concern over supply risks from the Israel-Hezbollah conflict and the prospect of increased supply in 2025 even as OPEC+ is expected to extend output cuts. Four Israeli tanks have entered the western side of the Lebanese border village of Khiyam, Lebanon's official news agency said on Friday, though both sides have made accusations of ceasefire violations.

Title: The best Apple Black Friday deals you’re hunting for are all right here!

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone, or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Cyber Monday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Cyber Monday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Cyber Monday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Save money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad first. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. However, there are some discounts on previous models: U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Cyber Monday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85 percent (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75 percent off at $1.99 a month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is offering subscriptions for $8 a month, 50 percent off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV+, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-day trial or even Apple’s 3 months for free if you buy an Apple product. In fact, there are even some Cyber Monday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals: Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go. (Prices subject to change.) Made for Amazon $14.99 ( 40% off, was $24.99 ) All New, Made for Amazon $14.99 ( 46% off, was $27.99 ) Michael Simon has been covering Apple for more than 20 years.

The Sensex and Nifty showed modest gains, with investors closely monitoring multiple economic signals and institutional movements. The Sensex opened marginally lower at 79,032.99 from its previous close of 79,043.74 but has moved up, trading at 79,402.52 as of 9.52 AM, gaining 358.78 points or 0.45 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty opened slightly higher at 23,927.15 compared to its previous close of 23,914.15 and is currently at 24,034.20, rising by 120.05 points or 0.50 per cent. The National Stock Exchange introduced F&O contracts for 45 new stocks across diverse sectors, including finance, technology, and renewable energy. Notable additions include Indian Bank, Union Bank, LIC, Cyient, KPIT Technologies, Adani Green Energy, DMart, and Zomato. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) displayed significant selling pressure, offloading equities worth ₹11,756 crore on November 28, contrasting with Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) who were net buyers, purchasing equities worth ₹8,718 crore. “A perplexing market action in recent days is the inexplicable volatility in FII activity,” said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “A few days of buying followed by yesterday’s massive selling is difficult to explain.” Sector-specific movements were prominent. Banking stocks showed potential positive traction due to improved deposit growth, with credit growth slowing to 11.15 per cent year-on-year, while deposit growth slightly exceeded at 11.21 per cent, according to RBI data. The insurance sector attracted attention as the government proposed raising Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limits from 74 per cent to 100 per cent, potentially opening up new investment opportunities. Top gainers included pharmaceutical stocks, with Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent), Cipla (1.75 per cent), and Dr Reddy’s (1.68 per cent) leading the pack. Mahindra & Mahindra (1.36 per cent) and Adani Ports (1.23 per cent) also showed positive momentum. Conversely, power and utility stocks faced challenges, with Power Grid experiencing a 1.54 per cent decline. Shriram Finance (-0.37 per cent), Coal India (-0.36 per cent), ITC (-0.27 per cent), and Tech Mahindra (-0.16 per cent) were among the top losers. “The market is expected to open on a flat note due to concerns over FII selling and a weak start in Asian markets,” noted Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities. “Asian indices dropped by up to 2 per cent following inflation data from Japan that exceeded expectations.” Technical analysts highlighted critical market levels. “Immediate support is placed at 23,800 and 23,680, which align with strong Fibonacci levels,” explained Mandar Bhojane from Choice Broking. “On the upside, 24,350 serves as immediate resistance.” Global factors continued to influence market sentiment, including ongoing concerns about US inflation, potential tariff threats, and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate policies. Market participants are advised to remain cautious and monitor sector-specific movements, with particular attention to banking, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. The market’s trajectory remains uncertain, with investors and analysts closely watching upcoming economic indicators and global economic developments.
