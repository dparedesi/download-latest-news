Alice: You saw GPT-2, right? Bob: Of course. Alice: It's running on GPUs using CUDA. OpenAI will keep scaling that up, and other groups will want to do the same thing. Bob: Right. Alice: So, does this mean we should buy Nvidia stock? Bob: I'm not sure. Nvidia makes the hardware used now, but why should we expect it to be the hardware used in the future? There's clearly room for improvement: current GPUs aren't optimized for lower-precision numbers or sparsity. Designs will change, which means a competitor might do better. At the scales we're talking about, it makes some sense to design your own ASICs. Google already has TPUs, and Amazon & Facebook will probably do something similar. Alice: OK, but researchers are all people who started out doing stuff on their personal GPU using CUDA. Bob: And you don't think AMD or somebody will be able to make other GPUs compatible with CUDA, now that it's a priority? Alice: Eventually, maybe, but I think you're massively underestimating the difficulty of that. Bob: Again, google is already using TPUs, so clearly they have software for that. Look, neural networks are mostly big matrix multiplications; chips for them should be easier to design than chips for graphics, and Nvidia has strong competition for GPUs. Alice: You want HBM for NN ASICs, and TSMC is the only company doing that well. Nvidia reserved a lot of their capacity. Bob: Apple did too. More importantly, if TSMC capacity is the limiting factor, then profits should go to them. There are contracts for now, but GPT-2 is still a ways off from being useful and it wouldn't make sense to make really big purchases until the next generation of ASICs comes out, at which point those contracts could be renegotiated and TSMC could raise their prices, up to the point where Samsung is almost as good an option. Alice: Hmm, maybe. I still think you're underestimating the software moat Nvidia has. Long-term, maybe there's a real competitor, but every big company is going to want to train their own language model ASAP. Bob: Why? I could understand fine-tuning, but why would they need to do that? I imagine there will be a few big groups making their own models, but then everybody else could just license the best ones. The competition should be even, meaning low net profits. There might even be competitive open-source models from somebody. Alice: No, big companies will want to make their own. You're not considering the incentives of people at those companies. If they think AI will be big, they'll want job experience "making AI". And CEOs will be afraid that markets will punish them for not having their own AI program, because investors will think experience with AI could be important in the future. Bob: What?! OpenAI has only been around for a few years! Corporate "experience" with AI won't matter; just hire decent people and read the latest papers. Alice: Maybe so, but that's not how a lot of investors think. Bob: Is that the basis of our investment plan, then? CEOs do something dumb to please dumb investors? Alice: You already said there's room for improvement with NN ASICs, right? Bob: Of course, you can [redacted]. But obviously a complete design is too large a project for just me. Alice: Well then, it seems you think there's room for them to continue improvements and stay ahead of other designers. Nvidia was leading for hardware acceleration of ray tracing, and they'll have a big budget, so it seems like they'll be leading for NN ASIC design too, at least for a while. Bob: I'm not convinced that such competence carries over to other designs. For all you know Apple or Amazon will do better than them. Or maybe Huawei, or Will Semiconductor. Alice: Even if that's true, you're looking too far ahead. Stock prices are based on profit in the last few quarters and the stories in media. There's a whole pipeline for this stuff, and it takes years. Also, Nvidia can afford to steal all the best GPU software people from AMD. Bob: Again, there are already TPUs. Alice: Fun fact, Nvidia is actually doing better in terms of NN performance per mm^2 than TPUs despite their processors being less special-purpose. Bob: OK, but presumably Google could still sell those if there's so much demand. Alice: Maybe Google just won't be able to make TPUs fast enough to sell them and do their own stuff. And maybe there just won't be much other strong competition in the relevant timeframe. Bob: Do all the best people want to work in Nvidia's giant open offices, then? It's not like they have a monopoly on talent; they certainly wouldn't hire me or [redacted]. Alice: Sure, but neither would the ASIC companies getting VC funding. If any ASIC startup actually becomes a threat, Nvidia can buy them out too. The Chinese talent pool is also somewhat separate, but then the Chinese companies have their geopolitical and management issues.

The Bible resonates across the ages, always having something to say to us no matter what may have changed in the world as a whole. It’s as true in 2025 as it ever has been. So, we’ll contemplate the events of the past year or so through the lens of this passage from Matthew: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” We begin with that human colossus overshadowing the entire globe: Donald Trump. We all know the story, even as it transmutes into legend, something that will be told, retold, analyzed, disparaged, and rekindled for generations to come. Even as he reached out to his opposition, Trump, during his first term, was interfered with to an extent never before witnessed in a presidential administration. Taking advice from Chris Christie, of all people, keeping on Christopher Wray and Mark Milley, hiring establishment backstabbers like William Barr—it gained him nothing. He was assailed, undercut, and betrayed on all sides—and yet he still succeeded in fulfilling much of his agenda. They cheated him out of his rightfully earned second term in 2020, secure in the knowledge that nobody would ever figure it out. Then came the impeachments—two of them one after the other, as if they were aware, deep down, that one couldn’t possibly work. Followed by a slew of bogus lawsuits that should even now result in disbarments and unbenchings across the country. Image by AI. They assured themselves that they’d buried the boogieman deep at the crossroads. They were mistaken. All the same, they must have been delighted when he ran again in ‘24, meaning that the GOP had nobody capable of taking his place (no surprise there). They’d beaten him once. They had humiliated and disgraced him, tarnished his name, and threatened his family. They could do it again. That worked out well. The American Left, the media, and the Deep State blew it as completely as anyone has ever blown anything. Blew it through overconfidence, ineptness, and sheer demented inability to grasp the reality they were facing. They tossed all their cards over the cliff edge and then jumped after them, laughing all the way down. The July coup, the Harris time-bomb, the Walz selection, the attempt to run an aging call girl as a racial messiah… all of it wasted effort, all of it leading to the inevitable conclusion. All the while, Trump campaigned like a man possessed, running a schedule that would have broken most men half his age. Sitting before corrupt, vindictive Democrat judges in the morning, then hopping a plane to host a rally in the afternoon—and doing it over and over again, day after day, week after week. Nothing slowed him down, not even an assassin’s bullet. This is the class of event that we’re too close to for proper judgment. It was years after Midway before anybody grasped what that victory meant. It was a decade after Apollo XI before we began to understand what had been thrown away. The same is true here. We may not live long enough to see the final outcome of what transpired this year. The Dems, needless to say, will never get it, which is as it should be. We turn now to Ukraine. The bully-worshippers who bow down to a KGB agent who uses nerve gas and radioisotopes against his critics should probably sit this one out. Ukraine is a fragment of a former empire that has spent decades trying to find its feet—and failing. In the strictest sense, Putin wasn’t wrong. No sane military analysis would see Ukraine as anything but a basket case state that was just aching to be snatched up by the first comer. Putin didn’t even call it a “war.” No—it was a “special military operation.” It would take about three days. It’s clear that Putin was thinking in terms of Crete, 1941. There, the German Luftwaffe flew in Ju-52 transports packed with troops to Maleme airfield, many of them actually crash-landing on the runway. These took control of the field thanks to a British commander who pulled his troops out to “regroup” them (have to make sure those boots are properly shined, pip-pip). Within hours, the Germans had landed thousands of troops, and the Brits were finished. Putin tried the same thing, sending in a large transport stuffed with Spetnaz special forces to take over Kyiv’s airport. But that plane was shot down, killing hundreds of Russia’s finest troops. The rest of the Ilyushins never showed up. The tank columns were caught in an unseasonable Rasputitsa, and here we are, going on three years later. As classic an example of asymmetric warfare as you are likely to find. The Ukrainians, out of necessity, revolutionized warfare with the use of cheap drones to negate much more advanced and expensive weapons. Putin’s military was exposed as essentially a massive hoax, his “18,000 tanks in storage” suddenly turning into piles of rust and broken parts. He lost most of his Black Sea fleet to a country without a Navy. Putin was, in the end, forced to turn to Russia’s traditional “strategy” (to stretch the term to its utmost limits): wasting troops by the thousands to gain a few hundred yards of ground. Even if Ukraine were to surrender today, it would still be a Russian failure. Putin has succeeded in awakening a somnolent NATO, encouraging much greater spending on armaments, wrecking the ruble, destroying Russia’s credit, ramming the BRICs alliance onto the rocks, and not least, losing something on the order of 750,000 men. As for the putative reason for the war in the first place—to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO—both Sweden and Finland have joined the alliance after generations (centuries, in Sweden’s case)—of neutrality. So now Putin has one of the most technologically adept and the most ferocious peoples in Europe lined up against him. Well done, Vlad. Now, if they could only learn to keep their hands out of the till. We turn to Israel. A little over a year ago, Israel was mired in one of the worst situations of its short lifetime. Iran’s long-term plans were coming to fruition. Israel was surrounded by enemies, including the effective and well-armed terror groups, Hamas and Hezb’allah. Russia had established military bases less than an hour’s flight from Israel’s borders. The Houthis, armed by Iran, were prepared to cut off the Red Sea. Israeli-Arab conciliation through the Abraham Accords, mediated by Donald Trump, lay in a state of limbo. Iran was drawing ever closer to unveiling a working nuclear weapon. Anti-Semitism was surging worldwide, triggered by Western-based Islamist groups and encouraged by the likes of Barry Obama, Jimmy Carter, Roger Waters, and the Congressional Squad. The Biden administration had blatantly and openly betrayed the Jewish state on all possible levels. And today? Well…if the Jews aren’t actually God’s chosen people, they’ll do until one comes along. It can be safely said that the situation has not been so much reversed as turned inside out and then run through a Klein bottle. Hamas has been constricted to one single neighborhood, where it is relentlessly being attritted. Hezb’allah has been decapitated in one of the most brilliant covert espionage operations on record. Iran’s air defenses have been shattered, and it now awaits the inevitable crushing of its nuclear sites. Syria has collapsed, with much of its military weaponry and supplies destroyed by Israel and the U.S., while the Russian naval task forces based there have taken to their heels. So the first have become last. Trump was supposed to act as an object lesson to any who would defy the Dem/Soros/BlackRock leviathan. Ukraine was supposed to vanish like the morning dew. Israel was to be subject to the Second Holocaust while the world shook its head and sighed. The last have become first. We stand on the verge of a new age with infinite promise and wrenching terrors that may, in fact, lead to those “broad, sunlit uplands” that we were promised so many years ago. The key now is to keep it going. We need to study how all this was done in order to ensure it continues being done. (Two suggestions: Curtail the “Reach across the aisle” types infesting the GOP—farewell, Mitt—and cease to respond to media efforts at promoting hysteria like the drone hoax and the H-1B tantrums. I’ve always understood MAGA to be comprised of adults. Let’s start acting like it.) Above all, we need to learn how to keep our chin up, how not to lose faith, how to take a bullet and come up fighting, and how to come out on top when all seems lost. And at last, because it is apt, because it is righteous, because it is true, we will end with another quote from the book on which our civilization is based: “The race does not always go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but time and chance happeneth to them all.” This essay was originally published in our subscriber-only e-newsletter, a weekly compilation of original essays from American Thinker editors.

Title: Defense Tech Scaling New Heights With Incoming Administration

Apex, a Shield Capital portfolio company, takes a selfie of its first space vehicle dubbed “Call to ... [+] Adventure” demonstrating its satellite subsystems working less than a year from design to satellite commissioning—the fastest deployment ever in its class. The recent run up in the stock market—especially for tech stocks—signals a stimulative business climate during the second Trump Administration which should fuel a continued rise for defense tech—the incorporation of new technologies such as AI, cyber, autonomy and space for military applications. The first Trump Administration saw an S&P 500 increase of 50%, a much larger tech stock increase of 138%, and 380% for the Magnificent 7 stocks. Looking forward, the combination of extended rate reductions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017), a lighter regulatory environment, and likely lower interest rates with easing inflation all create a positive economic outlook. This economic outlook provides fertile ground for gains in the defense tech sector which has already been one of the most promising areas for venture investors. Since 2021, venture investment in defense tech totals more than $100 billion, 40% more than the previous seven years combined. The factors driving increased investment are likely to intensify during the next four years: first, rising geopolitical tensions and, second, the technologies which militaries need are increasingly developed by the private sector rather than government labs. NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 16: Wall St. and Broad St. signs are seen by the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] (NYSE) building in the financial district of New York City, United States on August 16, 2021. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The first large-scale land war in Europe since World War II, renewed fighting in the Middle East, and China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea all highlight simultaneous geopolitical conflicts. Further, America’s adversaries—China, Russia, Iran and North Korea—are collaborating more closely than ever in an axis of autocrats which enable them to combine strengths in their collective goal of weakening the United States. During Trump’s first term in office and most recent campaign, he advocated modernizing and strengthening our military. In this campaign, he began referring to the Reagan doctrine of “peace through strength” which recalls an era when the U.S. spent 6% of GDP on defense compared to today’s 3%—the lowest relative level in 75 years. The incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker, is on record calling for a generational investment in defense spending at 5% of GDP. Military superiority now depends to a large degree on commercial technologies such as AI, autonomy, cyber, space, and others being used in military applications. The war in Ukraine has shown the power of these new technologies such as commercial satellite imagery, small aerial drones, and maritime autonomy which enabled Ukraine to sink or disable one-third of the Russian Fleet without a regular navy. In the last 50 years, there has been a dramatic shift in the drivers of military technology from government labs to consumers and businesses; consequently, venture funding has become the primary financing mechanism and is two to three times the size of the Defense Department’s R&D budget. The positive landscape for defense tech investing builds on several developments during the Biden Administration. The Defense Innovation Unit, created to deliver more commercial technology to the Pentagon, now has a $1 billion budget (up 8 times since I led it in 2022) and whose director now reports directly to the Secretary of Defense. The Office of Strategic Capital now has the authority to make up to $1 billion in loans for component technologies, like batteries or quantum computing, important for national security. Last year, the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced the Replicator initiative with the goal of delivering thousands of attritable autonomous systems within 18 months and said recently that the Department appears on track to do so. LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 12: A L3Harris IVER4 900 Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) / Unmanned ... [+] underwater vehicle (UUV) during the Oceanology International 2024 at ExCel on March 12, 2024 in London, England. The event is the global forum where ocean industry, academia and government connect to discover innovative solutions, from ocean technology, marine science communities, improving strategies for exploring, protecting and sustainably operating in the world's oceans and waterways. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) In addition, the U.S. Space Force announced its commercial acquisition strategy to buy more data from new satellite constellations that provide multi-modal sensors and ever-faster revisit rates. The U.S. Army’s autonomy program is on track to begin producing the Remote Combat Vehicle in 2027 while the USAF is developing a manned-unmanned teaming concept known as Combat Collaborative Autonomy to complement fighter jets. AI, cyber, autonomy and space technology, which my firm—Shield Capital—invests in, are increasingly applied to national security uses and this means more opportunity for a wider set of commercial vendors. In addition to the technology adoption, the Department has produced several studies on the defense industrial base including the first Industrial Strategy Implementation Plan and Supply Chain Risk Management, both of which identify the increased concentration of suppliers as a national security risk. There is a growing consensus that the supply base must broaden beyond the prime vendors which will create opportunities for more vendors. Given the importance of incorporating new technologies, growing the supply base and scaling new capabilities more quickly, there is tremendous upside for venture-backed companies which today supply only 1% of defense procurement. Some question whether the Department of Government Efficiency will dampen these trends. I believe this is highly doubtful since procurement was only 21% of the fiscal 2024 defense budget. There are richer opportunities for efficiency and reductions in the personnel budget (26% of the budget) and the maintenance of older ships, tanks and planes (35% of the budget). For example, staff positions in the Army have grown 40% since 9/11. Criticism of military procurement is likely to focus on the trillion-dollar programs such as the F-35 or Ford-class carriers. To modernize military capabilities as the U.S. did during the Reagan years means procuring newer technologies and weapons systems to replace aging fleets. CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - MAY 06: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at Cape ... [+] Canaveral Space Force Station on May 06, 2024 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is carrying 23 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) As a result, I believe DOGE will accelerate the trends fueling defense tech. Elon Musk will be a proponent of fixed-price contracts rather than the cost-plus approach of defense primes. A great example of a fixed-price contract is SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket development which was only 10% of NASA’s projected development cost. Additionally, many of the designees for key positions in national security in the new Administration are from business or venture capital backgrounds, similar to DOGE leadership, and are likely to bring a reform mindset of doing things differently and incorporating more private sector incentives like fixed-price contracts. Rising geopolitical tensions, increasing use of commercial technologies in military applications, the growing need to diversify the defense supply base and the priorities of the incoming Trump Administration combine to create a better outlook than ever before for defense tech. These underlying trends will certainly benefit the defense unicorns such as SpaceX, Anduril and Palantir but they will also lead the way for an ever-growing set of new suppliers like Apex, Danti and Code Metal—three Shield Capital investments. Code Metal’s customer, Tigris Systems, benefits by the rapid deployment of AI algorithms to ... [+] intelligent edge sensor networks to ensure more reliable and predictable global transportation of goods. In the Cold War, Silicon Valley technologies helped make us more secure as a nation; history is repeating itself but with a whole new set of technologies and vendors which will equip our warfighters with the best the nation has to offer. Modernizing our force and expanding our warfighter capabilities from a greater number of suppliers will elevate defense tech to new heights. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Dumps $2,500,000,000 Portfolio, Pours Millions Into New Asset: Report

Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is exploring new opportunities after dumping more than $2.5 billion in stocks. The famed investor and head of Duquesne Family Office sold all of the firm’s shares of Nvidia (NVDA) last year, along with nearly all of the firm’s stake in Palantir (PLTR). Now, Druckenmiller is beginning to pour some of the firm’s massive cash stockpile into Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), buying 1,427,950 shares worth about $30.3 million, reports the Motley Fool. The stock surged more than 100% in 2024, as the company settled opioid litigation and reported strong growth after centering its efforts on brand-name drugs. As of Q3 2024, the top holdings at Duquesne Family Office include Natera (NTRA) worth $452 million, Coupang (CPNG) valued at $287 million, Coherent (COHR) at $264 million, Woodward (WWD) at $181 million and Seagate Technology (STX) at $179 million. In a recent interview with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Druckenmiller said his top concern is whether the Federal Reserve started cutting rates too soon. “When this whole inflationary episode started, and I’d say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on. But I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. You can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I’ve switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself. I’m a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don’t have conviction like I had in 2021 that inflation was going to go up, that’s when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don’t have conviction that they’ve snuffed this thing out and won the battle.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: FAIR: Why Didn’t NYT Tell Us What Ben Smith Stood to Gain From His Media Reporting?

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. Announcing their hiring of Ben Smith, New York Times editors (1/28/20) declared, “Ben not only understands the seismic changes remaking media, he has lived them — and in some cases, led them.” In a time of downsizing and consolidation, Ben Smith has had a journalistic career many would envy. He became famous as the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, and is co-founder and editor-in-chief of Semafor, a rising media giant that raised $19 million last year. (This “replac[ed] the money it had received from the disgraced cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried,” the New York Times reported—5/24/23). These two adventures bookend his two-year stint as the “Media Equation” columnist at the New York Times, from March 2020 through January 2022. During his entire tenure there, Smith held an undisclosed amount of stock options in BuzzFeed, creating a conflict of interest for him and the Times, which both consistently waved away (Slate, 10/15/21). “Under New York Times policy, I can’t write about BuzzFeed extensively until I divest stock options in the company,” Smith explained on several occasions (here 9/26/21). But from his influential perch, Smith did, of necessity, cover BuzzFeed’s competitors, frequently critically, putting his investment’s rivals and potential rivals in a bad light. Buzzfeed started out as pure internet culture, a website offering entertainment and quizzes. But it expanded into hard news, thus competing with others in that new media mold, like the nodes of the Gawker empire. Smith’s stake in BuzzFeed exceeded $7 million, according to FAIR’s sources—a strikingly large material interest in a company whose competitors Smith regularly covered, underscoring the ethical concerns about both Smith’s coverage and the Times’ willingness to ignore its own ethical guidelines. With a considerable financial stake in online media, Ben Smith could have different reasons from the rest of us for freaking out about Substack (New York Times, 4/11/21). Smith (New York Times, 10/17/21) covered sexual harassment allegations at Axel Springer as the Berlin-based multimedia company was looking to grow its footprint in the US media market—making it a potential competitor to BuzzFeed. In a critical piece (New York Times, 4/11/21) about the self-publishing platform Substack, which includes heavy investment from venture capitalist and Trump supporter Marc Andreessen, Smith wrote: Substack has courted a number of Times writers. I turned down an offer of an advance well above my Times salary, in part because of the editing and the platform the Times gives me, and in part because I didn’t think I’d make it back—media types often overvalue media writers. Smith appears to be putting his cards on the table here, but readers have no way of knowing that his financial interest in BuzzFeed far eclipsed the salary he was getting from the Times or was offered by Substack, a new media product that competed against the very company, BuzzFeed, he was invested in. Smith (New York Times, 4/18/21) also pooh-poohed Bustle’s growth with Mic and Nylon, and its eye on restarting Gawker, in part because Bustle bet on advertising revenue, which Smith maintained was destined to flow overwhelmingly to Google and Facebook (later rebranded as Meta). A month later, Bustle rebranded in preparation for its IPO (Axios, 5/11/21)—an initial public offering to investors. A month after that, Hollywood Reporter (6/30/21) noted that BuzzFeed was one of a number of media companies, including Bustle, that were looking to go public in order to shore up investments. Once again, readers should have had a clear understanding that Smith was writing about an entity that was competing for venture capital with the outlet he had major holdings in. A story by Smith in the New York Times (9/26/21) contributed to the downfall of the media startup Ozy—a company that Buzzfeed under Smith’s leadership considered buying. The most interesting example of Smith’s conflict of interest is the case of Ozy Media. Carlos Watson, a former MSNBC and CNN anchor, attracted lots of attention when he launched Ozy, raising $5.3 million in its early days (Venture Capital Post, 12/28/13), reaching up to an enormous $20 million investment from Axel Springer (USA Today, 10/6/24). Watson and his media child were riding high—for a time. Smith (New York Times, 9/26/21) was the first journalist to raise questions about the veracity of Ozy’s claims to investors. Less than two years later, Watson was arrested for fraud (Wall Street Journal, 2/23/23), and the operation was no more (Variety, 3/1/23). He and the company were ultimately found guilty in a New York City federal court earlier this year, “in a case accusing them of lying to investors about the now-defunct startup’s finances and sham deals with Google and Oprah Winfrey” (Reuters, 7/16/24). He was sentenced to 10 years in prison (AP, 12/16/24). Smith’s reporting on Ozy was considered momentous, leading to the downfall of a high-flying media startup. But Smith was not a disinterested journalist when he went after Watson and Ozy. Late last year, Ozy sued Smith, BuzzFeed and Semafor for allegedly stealing Ozy’s trade secrets (Reuters, 12/21/23); in the initial complaint, Ozy’s legal team said that Smith was interested in BuzzFeed acquiring Ozy as early as 2019. It is also through this case that we have a better understanding of Smith’s financial interest in BuzzFeed during his time as a Times media columnist. According to FAIR’s sources, the prosecution obtained financial records from BuzzFeed in discovery that document how much stake Smith has had in the company over time. FAIR has not seen this sealed document; however, David Robinson, a business scholar at Duke University who served as an expert witness for the defense, did see it. In an April filing in the case, Robinson noted that in Smith’s original report about Ozy, he disclosed that “Under New York Times policy, I can’t write about BuzzFeed extensively until I divest stock options in the company, which I left last year.” But, Robinson noted: Columnist Benjamin Smith had, at the time of that article’s writing, an ownership stake in BuzzFeed in the form of stock options. Those options would become valuable if BuzzFeed went public later in 2021 in an initial public offering (IPO). In an IPO, options holders, such as Smith, are able to convert their options at the then-anticipated IPO price of $10 per share. Analyzing BuzzFeed’s capital table, I calculated the number of Ben Smith’s outstanding split-adjusted shares. I then computed, for each option grant, the stock price minus the option exercise price multiplied by the number of options for each option grant, to arrive at the proceeds that Ben Smith would net upon selling his options. I estimate that Ben Smith’s options had an expected value of approximately $23,468,268.64. On January 4, 2022, the New York Times announced that Smith had left the paper to start a new media company, one [that] “would aim to break news and offer nuance to complex stories, without falling into familiar partisan tropes.” In a phone interview with FAIR, Robinson clarified that, since he issued this testimony, he revised his calculations based on BuzzFeed’s capitalization table. This reduced his estimate of Smith’s stake to $7.4 million, still a princely sum—and a valuation that he said, to his knowledge, hasn’t been challenged. “I think he had a clear sizable material stake in BuzzFeed in the time when other corporations’ decisions were immediately impacting the value of BuzzFeed,” Robinson told FAIR. “I’m simply trying to bring to light the bias that seems to be apparent.” The New York Times‘ rules about financial conflicts cite as an example, “a reporter responsible for any segment of media coverage may not own any media stock”—and make clear that that includes options. That Smith had a conflict of interest does not mean that all or indeed any of the reporting he published about BuzzFeed‘s rivals was untrue or unjustified. (Some of the outlets he criticized, like Substack and German media giant Axel Springer, are ones I’ve also critiqued at FAIR—3/4/21, 11/5/21). The problem with Smith’s conflict of interest is that it gave him a financial incentive to encourage the decline of these particular outlets. Times readers can’t know whether, or how much, this incentive factored into his journalistic decisions—especially as the scale of the conflict was not made clear to those readers. Moreover, the Times has clear rules about stock ownership. Its ethics guidelines say: No staff member may own stock or have any other financial interest in a company, enterprise or industry that figures or is likely to figure in coverage that he or she provides, edits, packages or supervises regularly. In several early columns, Smith included disclaimers about the conflict. In a column (5/3/20) on union organizing in newsrooms that mentioned his experience at BuzzFeed, for instance, Smith included this disclosure: I agreed with the Times when I was hired that I wouldn’t cover BuzzFeed extensively in this column, beyond leaning on what I learned during my time there, because I retain stock options in the company, which could bring me into conflict with the Times’ ethics standards. I also agreed to divest those options as quickly as I could, and certainly by the end of the year. But this deadline was quietly extended—and BuzzFeed went public right before he left the Times (Vox, 12/6/21). It appears that he never wrote directly about BuzzFeed, but Slate‘s Justin Peters (10/15/21) noted that as the end-of-year deadline came and went, Smith’s columns stopped mentioning any sort of deadline by which he would divest. When Peters inquired with the Times, spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said Smith’s deadline was extended until February 2022—two years after he was hired. BuzzFeed went public in December 2021. Smith left the Times to start Semafor in January 2022. Rhoades Ha told FAIR that Smith’s deadline was extended “due to the pandemic,” and that he “disclosed the options when relevant in that period.” Smith and the media desk at Semafor did not respond to requests for comment. Pointing out that it’s “bad for readers to have a media columnist whose motives they cannot absolutely trust to be disinterested,” Slate‘s Justin Peters (10/15/21) wrote that Smith “probably shouldn’t be writing about such a broad swath of digital media.” Peters (Slate, 10/15/21) reported that neither Smith nor the Times explained why Smith stopped putting a divestment deadline on the investment disclosures in his columns. Further, he said: Neither Smith nor Rhoades Ha responded to separate questions about why, exactly, the Times extended Smith’s divestment deadline, or whether the shifting deadline had anything to do with BuzzFeed’s plans to go public. But an SEC filing from July pertaining to BuzzFeed’s proposed SPAC merger—and an amended filing dated October 1—describes a 180-day post-merger lockup period during which certain stockholders and options holders are prohibited from transferring their shares. The Times is not offering a sufficient answer. For one thing, it ignores the scope of Smith’s reported stake. Had he stood to gain a few thousand dollars from his former media employer while working on the media beat, big deal (sarcasm). But millions? Big deal (not sarcasm). And there seems to be a betrayal of the spirit of the Times’ own codes about conflicts of interest when the deadline was extended for him; if the paper can bend the rules on the media beat, where else could it bend the rules? When FAIR told Robinson that the Times confirmed that the Smith’s deadline to divest had been extended, he countered, “What good is a stop sign if you tell people they’re free to run through it?” “Given that he was a senior executive, it stands to reason he’d have a significant stake in the company,” Robinson said of Smith and BuzzFeed. “I just think it’s not appropriate for him to be writing about the company’s competitors.” FAIR’s work is sustained by our generous contributors, who allow us to remain independent.

Gen Z faces the disappearance of management jobs in 2025. In 2025, it’s predicted that 1 in 10 management roles will be filled by Gen Z. But that’s a complicated statistic, when management jobs are going the way of the milk man and the fax machine. Forbes highlights the stark reality of white-collar job cuts, with middle-management positions being systematically eliminated at organizations like Google, Meta, UPS and others. Indeed, middle management positions accounted for nearly a third of layoffs in 2023, according to reports from Live Data Technologies. That’s bad news for Gen Z workers seeking guidance, mentoring and oversight. Or a white-collar job in management. Is management a disappearing career? CNBC reports that Amazon is shifting to an individual-contributor model - a type of unbossing that could foster the elimination of as many as 14,000 management roles. Other companies are making similar moves on a smaller scale, cutting into the middle to improve the bottom line. What’s really at work here? Is AI making middle management positions redundant? “Digital transformation plays a significant role,” according to Joseph Roh, a professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University who commented on the unbossing trend on CNBC. “Automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software.” While management is disappearing, employee engagement is suffering. Gallup notes that the connection between employees and managers is a driving force behind performance and employee wellbeing, stating that “the role of the manager has never been more important”. But is it really? The crisis for Gen Z isn’t that thousands of middle managers have lost their jobs. The key takeaway here is that these jobs don’t really exist anymore. Is it any wonder that employee engagement is in the ditch, and Forbes reports that 52% of Gen Z workers don’t want to be middle managers? Self-leadership is the direction for Gen Z, but navigating without guidance might be the real challenge. In a Harris poll, 82% of managers said that Gen Z new hires need more training in soft skills. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of Gen Z employees say that these highly-desired soft skills can’t be taught, and can only be developed by watching more seasoned employees over time. A Catch-22 is the result of these mutually conflicting conditions. It’s the classic chicken and the egg paradox: how do you gain valuable experience without the opportunity to gain valuable experience? Or be managed by those who can share it? The Harris Poll revealed that over half of Gen Z employees feel underprepared for professional roles, citing a lack of soft-skill training during their formative years (read: COVID). How do you demonstrate what you have not observed, learned or experienced? Over half of Gen Z employees say that a lack of interpersonal training makes them afraid of “asking dumb questions”. According to the survey, nearly 60% of Gen Z employees don’t know who to turn to for help with their soft skills. Perhaps because their manager was recently fired? Linda Jingfang Cai, VP of talent development at LinkedIn, told Fortune that soft skills are “the currency of the future workplace”. She said that any company helmed by people who don’t prioritize empathy and connection will lose out on this vital currency. As AI further integrates itself into business operations, soft skills are becoming more significant in 2025. Think judgment, teamwork, and articulating a vision—even a vision for the next phase of AI. Coaching can augment unknowns, accelerate experience and provide a safe space for “dumb questions”. Here are three actionable ways coaching can help: For Gen Z, the workplace of 2025 is a crucible of opportunity and challenge - with more of the latter inhibiting the former. If engagement and performance are going to be a part of the future of work, individuals and organizations have to access new skills, now. Self-leadership has never been more important than it is now. That trend is only going to continue in the age of AI. Through a commitment to coaching and skill-building, Gen Z and employers can bridge the management gap - and be better prepared for the future of work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Morgan Stanley Joins U.S. Bank Exodus from Climate Coalition

Yesterday evening, Morgan Stanley became the latest US bank to depart from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, as pressure increasingly mounted on financial institutions from Republican lawmakers. Despite leaving the alliance, Morgan Stanley said in a statement that the bank’s commitment to meeting its carbon targets “remains unchanged”. Citigroup and Bank of America also left the group earlier this week, while Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs departed earlier in December. The UN-backed alliance, which includes over 140 banks with more than $70 trillion (£56.5 trillion) in assets, was founded in 2021 with the goal of bringing the financial sector into alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. It is an initiative of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, co-chaired by Michael Bloomberg and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Other voluntary industry climate alliances, including the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the now-disbanded Net Zero Insurance Alliance, and the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative have similarly seen exits from major industry players in recent years. A large reason for the departure of many financial institutions from institutions like this has been pressure from right-wing lawmakers in the US to try and push banks away from sustainable investing. The issue has been a thorn in the side of giant US asset managers such as Blackrock, who have faced condemnation and attacks from Republican politicians. Last year, Blackrock was sued by the attorney general of Tennessee over its ESG policies, while it has been dropped from the public pension funds of multiple US states due to its support of sustainable investing. In November, Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford left both the Climate Action 100+ group and Net Zero Asset Managers initiative after it became embroiled in a months-long scandal over its sponsorship of literary festivals. “Our membership has become contested, and this risks distracting from our core responsibilities,” a Baillie Gifford spokesperson told City AM at the time. Despite fears that the departures may lead to a watering down of climate pledges, analysts explained that as regulatory burdens have grown on financial institutions to hire those with sustainability credentials, the need to be part of these groups has become less necessary.

Title: Risk Appetites Dim in Week of New Year’s Angst on Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- The turning of the calendar is an occasion to look ahead. For Wall Street at New Year’s, the verdict on the future is one of trepidation. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue Burned-Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces Detroit’s Michigan Central Is the Building Revival Story of 2024 While spirits perked up on Friday, traders across asset classes spent much of the post-holiday period reining in the robust risk appetites that have ruled markets for much of 2024. Volatility measures crept up in Treasuries and corporate credit. They jumped in stocks, which posted the worst end-of-year slump on record. The largest exchange-traded fund tracking Bitcoin, darling of speculators globally, saw its worst-ever outflows. Nothing in markets implied panic. But the moves did signal a wariness that has been largely absent in the past 12 months, at least in risk assets where a booming economy and easing Federal Reserve policy have been a recipe for nearly straight-up gains. Concern about Donald Trump’s presidential policies and their impact on inflation awoke hedging markets and kept bonds unsettled after the biggest quarterly runup in 10-year Treasury yields in more than two years. To contrarians who have watched months of rampant risk-taking on Wall Street, any newfound caution is seen as healthy — a brake on overheating. Still, the pullback in certain assets, equities in particular, defied a historic pattern where the S&P 500 has tended to rise in the sessions right after Christmas, highlighting the hazards of preset playbooks in the second Trump era. “We were a little surprised to see the market so risk-off at the end of 2024, but it is possible that the market was getting a slight jump on 2025,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “It makes sense to us to take some risk off the table given the incoming administration is likely to make policy changes.” Ten-year Treasury yields held above the widely watched 4.5% level as traders braced for tariffs that could come as early as this month after Trump’s inauguration, adding fresh risk to the Fed’s inflation-fighting campaign. Bond vigilantes have also been sounding alarms that Trump’s tax-cut agenda threatens to widen the fiscal deficit. Signs of bullishness resurfaced on Friday, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% as megacap tech stocks rallied and investors took relief from a swift re-election of the US House speaker. For the week, equities retreated, hovering near a low reached after the Fed’s last policy meeting, when central bankers signaled fewer interest rate reductions for this year than previously forecast. The specter of policy uncertainty has put investors on edge, with demand for protection rising across assets. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of the cost of S&P 500 options, climbed for a third week in four. A similar measure for Treasuries, the ICE BofA Move Index, hit a one-month high while turbulence ticked up in high-yield bonds and currencies. The low-level gloom is a departure from recent months, when raging gambling spirits sent Bitcoin above $100,000 and drove billions of dollars to leveraged ETFs. Now, BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is seeing its longest streak of outflows, including a record withdrawal on Thursday, while short sellers are reloading wagers against some of the largest ETFs tracking corporate debt. In equities, an indicator of exposure kept by the National Association of Active Investment Managers slipped for a third straight week, marking the biggest drop since April. Meanwhile, a Cboe measure of options trading showed that volume in bearish puts spiked to the highest level in almost four months relative to bullish calls. The risk aversion, for now, is at odds with optimism among Wall Street strategists in a Bloomberg survey, whose consensus calls for another 12% gain in 2025 after the S&P 500 scored a two-year, 53% rally. “The dominant market view is that equities will continue climbing a wall of worry, but we know the incoming US administration loves building tall walls. In other words, the obstacles to keep delivering gains will get bigger,” said Max Gokhman, senior vice president at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. “So while I’m not going out of consensus to be bearish, it’s prudent to be careful and ready to tactically return to the sidelines.” Higher anxiety levels are visible across markets. Bank of America Corp.’s Global Financial Stress indicator — which measures market risk, hedging demand and investor flows — sat above where it was 12 months ago. Part of the uneasiness reflects lingering concern over market valuations, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. A Bloomberg model that adjusts the S&P 500 earnings yield and 10-year Treasury rates for inflation shows pricing for the world’s two most-watched assets is historically stretched. In fact, current cross-asset valuations, in real terms, are higher than 88% of the time in data going back to 1962. “A modicum of caution at these tight valuations make sense but the growth story still feels intact,” Rosner said.

Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 in 2024, having nearly tripled in value. It has become one of the best-known AI stocks in recent years, because its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for AI applications. According to Jon Peddie Research, the market for add-on GPUs grew 47.9% between the second quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 (the latest quarter for which data is available) [0]Jon Peddie Research. Shipments of graphics AIBs see significant surge in Q2 2024. Accessed Dec 13, 2024.View all sources. Nvidia is the biggest player in this market, and its GPUs power some of the most prominent AI products, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But it isn’t a monopoly, and there are a few publicly traded companies that compete with Nvidia. Nvidia controls more than four-fifths of the market for add-on GPUs. But there are two other companies with some market share: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Source: Jon Peddie Research. Before graphics processing units became prized for industrial computing activities such as running AI models and Bitcoin mining, they were mainly used in gaming PCs and video game consoles — to, as their name suggests, process graphics. AMD has been Nvidia’s main rival ever since their gaming days, but both companies now derive most of their revenue from selling chips and services to data centers. AMD isn’t quite as specialized in AI chips as Nvidia is, and it has a fraction of its market share. But in 2023, several of the world’s largest tech companies switched from using Nvidia chips to AMD’s Instinct MI300X chip for new AI projects.

Intel is probably more of a household name than AMD or Nvidia. If you’re reading this article on a Windows computer, there’s a good chance there’s an Intel processor in it. However, Intel is newer to the market for GPUs and other AI chips than Nvidia and AMD. Intel launched both its first GPU and its first specialized AI chip in 2022 — although as shown on the graph above, it hasn’t made much of a dent in the market shares of Nvidia and AMD. Together, Nvidia, AMD and Intel make up just about 100% of the market for AI chips, but these three are not entirely alone in the chipmaking space. Many big tech companies are developing their own AI hardware, too — they just don’t sell very much of it at the moment. These minor chipmakers include: Alphabet (GOOG). Amazon (AMZN). Apple (AAPL). IBM (IBM). Microsoft (MSFT). Qualcomm (QCOM). In some cases, these companies have negligible shares of the overall AI chip market because they’ve primarily developed chips for “in-house” use — to power their own AI products and systems. For example, Microsoft is a major backer of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Likewise, Amazon is a major shareholder of Anthtropic, a private company that developed Claude, a large language model (LLM) that competes with ChatGPT. Alphabet is the maker of Gemini, another ChatGPT rival. The companies listed in the previous section control tiny shares of the AI chip market — but that doesn’t mean they’re tiny companies. All of them are blue-chip tech stocks, and all except IBM and Qualcomm are worth trillions of dollars. A well-diversified portfolio will likely have exposure to some or all of these stocks, either through index funds or individual shares. When it comes to Nvidia’s biggest competitors, AMD and Intel, it’s hard to say what the future holds. Wall Street analysts generally believe that there’s a place for AMD in the chip market of the future, but they’re more pessimistic about Intel. Of the analysts surveyed by TipRanks who cover AMD, 73% give it a “buy” rating, with the rest rating it a “hold.” That’s not a bad percentage, although it’s lower than Nvidia’s. (For reference, 92.5% of TipRanks-surveyed analysts covering Nvidia rate it a “buy,” with the rest rating it a “hold.”) Nvidia and AMD have been vying for control of the GPU market for decades. Nvidia has the lead right now, but AMD has recently had some successes with its AI chipmaking efforts, such as big orders from Microsoft, Meta (META) and OpenAI. However, analysts are more bearish on Intel, which entered the AI chip market later and has failed to get as much traction as Nvidia or AMD. As shown above, Intel currently accounts for less than 1% of the add-on GPU market. Of the analysts surveyed by TipRanks who cover Intel, 76% rate it a “hold,” and 21% rate it a “sell,” with only 3% rating it a “buy.” » MORE: Best-performing semiconductor stocks Neither the author nor editor held positions in the aforementioned investments at the time of publication.

Title: VanEck CEO recommends investors to double down on Bitcoin as hedge in 2025

As gold and Bitcoin register a bull market, Jan van Eck stated that these assets are essential for any portfolio. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, has recommended that investors maintain or increase their exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and gold in 2025 in the firm’s 2025 outlook report. He argued that these assets are indispensable hedges against inflationary pressures, fiscal uncertainty, and global de-dollarization trends. According to van Eck, gold and Bitcoin have proven to be resilient stores of value amidst global economic turbulence. He added: “Bull markets in gold and Bitcoin are supported by inflationary pressures, fiscal uncertainty, and de-dollarization trends.” Consequently, he emphasized that these assets are essential for any portfolio seeking to guard against inflation. Robust foreign central bank purchases and a growing shift away from reliance on the US dollar in global trade drive gold’s current bull market. This de-dollarization trend has amplified the demand for gold as a stable and reliable asset. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently surged past the $100,000 mark, continuing its bull cycle following the halving event in the second quarter of 2024. Van Eck projects BTC could reach $150,000 to $170,000 during this cycle, driven by its increasing adoption as a “store of value” asset. Additionally, based on historical patterns from prior halving events, Bitcoin is in the midst of a three-year bull market, which positions it as a pivotal asset for long-term wealth preservation. While van Eck acknowledges the potential for volatility, particularly in gold, he remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for both assets. As a result, even amid price corrections, the fundamentals of BTC and gold will remain strong. Notably, van Eck’s vision aligns with other analysts. In October, Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted that BTC is a hedge for systemic financial risks, although not a solid alternative for geopolitical tensions. In a nine-page letter published in September, BlackRock told its investors that Bitcoin is resilient to “black swan” macro events, such as banking system crises, sovereign debt crises, currency debasement, and geopolitical disruption. The document also highlighted that Bitcoin could be used to hedge against possible US dollar instability stemming from federal debt and deficit fears, which would further improve the attractiveness of alternative assets.

Title: Bitcoin – How USD’s strength, low stablecoin supply could dictate price action

A stronger dollar tends to weaken the demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 in mid-December. Since then, the king coin has struggled to regain its momentum on the charts. At press time, BTC was trading at $96,789 following gains of 1.5% in 24 hours, with the crypto still just over 10% shy of its ATH. While Bitcoin could stage a recovery later this month thanks to Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S President, two key factors could continue to weigh on the price. The U.S dollar index (DXY), which measures the performance of the U.S dollar against major currencies, has surged to 109 – its highest level since November 2022. What this hike indicates is that the U.S dollar has been gaining strength lately. (Source: MarketWatch) The DXY is inversely correlated with Bitcoin’s price, meaning that a hike limits the coin’s upside potential. Additionally, a stronger dollar tends to weaken the demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. In fact, the fall in demand is already evident in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. On the first day of trading in 2025, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded $332M in outflows, marking its highest outflows in history. The total outflows from all 11 Bitcoin ETFs hit $242M, as per SoSoValue. If these outflows persist, it could fuel a surge in sell-side pressure. This will, in turn, fuel a downtrend for BTC on the charts. The weakened demand seemed not only evident among institutional investors, but also in the retail market. For instance – According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) surged to 17 – Its highest level in seven days. (Source: CryptoQuant) A higher ratio means that the supply of stablecoins is low, compared to BTC’s market cap. This results in low buying pressure that could exert downward pressure on the price. Despite market factors pointing to reducing demand and buying pressure, the Fear and Greed Index, which measures the market sentiment, revealed that traders are still bullish. This index had a value of 74 at press time, suggesting that most traders are optimistic about BTC’s price movement. Since the index climbed from 65 earlier this week, it could be good news for BTC if traders start buying. However, if the buy-side pressure is not enough to absorb the sold coins, it could limit the gains on the charts.

Title: 2024: The Year Crypto Silenced Its Critics? The Numbers Tell All

The chart tracks the frequency of “Bitcoin obituaries” - articles declaring Bitcoin’s demise - from ... [+] 2010 to 2024. The number of such articles peaked dramatically in 2017 with 124 publications, coinciding with Bitcoin’s first major price surge. Since then, obituaries have steadily declined, reaching just 2 articles in 2024 despite Bitcoin crossing $100,000. This reduction in negative predictions, from the 2017 peak to present day, suggests a notable shift in how the cryptocurrency is perceived by commentators and institutions. After Donald Trump’s election in 2024, an unexpected moment of candor emerged from an unlikely source. On their long-running Crypto Critics' Corner podcast, Cas Piancey and Bennett Tomlin—two of cryptocurrency's most well informed skeptics—made a striking admission. After years of investigating and criticizing Tether and the broader crypto ecosystem, they conceded that their long-predicted regulatory crackdown was unlikely to materialize. In their words “They win, we lose”. This moment of capitulation from prominent critics wasn't an isolated incident. At 99Bitcoins, a website that has diligently tracked Bitcoin's "death" pronouncements since 2010, the editors found themselves with surprisingly little to do in 2024. Their "Bitcoin obituaries" counter, which records major declarations of Bitcoin's demise by media and notable figures, recorded just two such pronouncements all year: the lowest number since 2012. The pattern is striking. Bitcoin obituaries peaked in 2017 with 124 declarations of its death, coinciding with its first major price surge. Another surge appeared in 2021-2022 during Bitcoin's second major bull run and the subsequent FTX collapse. But 2024's mere two obituaries mark a shift in perception. The Bitcoin ETF approval has a lot to do with this. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in March 2024 didn't just mark a regulatory milestone, it unleashed an unprecedented wave of institutional adoption. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, in particular, shattered every previous ETF launch record. Reaching $10 billion in assets under management in just seven weeks, it accomplished what took the previous record-holder, SPDR Gold Shares, two years to achieve. By the end of 2024, the iShares Bitcoin Trust had accumulated over $50 billion in assets under management—a stunning achievement in just 11 months. The first day of trading alone saw volumes exceeding $4.65 billion, signalling massive pent-up demand from both institutional and retail investors. With total net assets over $106 billion, these Bitcoin ETFs aren't just successful: they're approaching the scale of gold ETFs that have been established for decades. This isn't merely adoption; it's a wholesale transformation of how traditional finance views and accesses cryptocurrency. Larry Fink's evolution from crypto skeptic to champion perfectly embodies this transformation. The BlackRock CEO's journey from dismissing Bitcoin as a money laundering tool to overseeing one of the most successful ETF launches in financial history represents the broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. The transformation in the political sphere has been equally dramatic. Donald Trump, once a cryptocurrency skeptic who described Bitcoin as "a scam against the dollar" in 2021, has emerged as a powerful voice in the crypto space. His appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference marked a key moment in cryptocurrency's global political legitimacy. The selection of JD Vance, a well-known crypto advocate, as his vice presidential candidate further signalled cryptocurrency's emergence as a serious policy consideration. Perhaps most significantly, the conversation in Washington has evolved from regulatory skepticism to strategic opportunity. The discussion of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. Senate - unthinkable just a few years ago - represents a fundamental shift in how government officials view cryptocurrency's role in the national economy. This isn't just about accepting crypto's existence; it's about potentially integrating it into national financial strategy. This acceptance isn't limited to Bitcoin. Stablecoins, backed by major financial institutions and payment processors like Stripe, are processing transaction volumes comparable to traditional payment networks like Visa. This represents a fundamental innovation in payment technology that's becoming impossible to ignore. The steep decline in Bitcoin obituaries in 2024 isn't just a statistical curiosity. It's a marker of cryptocurrency's transition from a speculative phenomenon to an established part of the financial landscape. The question is no longer whether crypto will survive, but how it will evolve and integrate with traditional financial systems. The editors at 99Bitcoins might find themselves even less busy in the years to come, but they've documented something remarkable: the year when cryptocurrency's critics had to accept that crypto is here to stay.

Title: Top Expert Sees 'Healthy Pause' for Bitcoin ETF Growth

U.Today - The start of 2025 brought an unexpected twist for BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as investors pulled out a whopping $332.6 million in just one day, which is equal to 3,413 BTC. This is the biggest withdrawal from the ETF since it launched, bigger than the $188.7 million anti record, which happened in the last decade of December. A top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg reacted to the historical anti record with a more "glass half full" approach, claiming that these pullbacks are to be expected and are long overdue. He also said that Bitcoin ETFs probably won't keep growing so fast, and while the amount of money that left might have caught some by surprise, it's just a sign that things are shifting. It's like taking a breather on a journey where you have been moving forward consistently, from an expert's point of view. The timing of these outflows lines up with a developing story in Bitcoin's price dynamics. There is a pattern on the charts that looks like a "head-and-shoulders" shape, and if it breaks below the $92,000 neckline, it could take the price to as low as $70,000 per BTC. The details still tell a different story as IBIT ended 2024 on a strong note, pulling in over $37 billion in inflows over the year. Its Ethereum equivalent, ETHA, also got a lot of attention, raking in $3.53 billion. These ETFs helped solidify BlackRock's spot as a major player in institutional crypto investment, with Bitcoin holdings worth about $53 billion and Ethereum at almost $3.7 billion. But even the best of these funds can be affected by market cycles. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Answering your questions about AI, smart glasses, TikTok, and more

Time Published: 2025-01-03T18:38:26Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. As promised, I’ve got a special mailbag issue this week. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions. Like last year, I picked a handful that hit some of the themes I plan to continue covering in 2025. On to your questions… I’m really concerned / worried / curious about the near-term future. Between now and 10 years from now, I think it is very clear AI will be replacing many job functions. What are we all going to do? The leaders at the AI labs say that, yes, there will be job loss, but that doesn’t mean catastrophe. The optimistic take is that humans are creative and will invent new jobs, like they always have when technology changes things. At the moment, there’s also a macro belief among the CEOs driving a lot of the spending on infrastructure for AI that its impact will be deflationary and lead to GDP growth. Job displacement will still be painful, of course. Sam Altman and others believe that some form of universal basic income will be necessary to offset the economic impacts of AGI. Altman has his other startup, Tools for Humanity, already scanning eyeballs and distributing cryptocurrency. But I think it’s way too early to be seriously concerned. As Altman himself recently said, AGI is going to be declared soon and we probably won’t notice. How much better is the reasoning on AI models, and is it actually something I should care about? I know people who have tried ChatGPT’s o1 pro mode and notice a difference. But I haven’t seen anything mind-blowing from o1 or what Noam Shazeer at Google just put out, though perhaps I am a bit jaded by the last two years of AI hype. My advice would be to play with what you can access / afford and see for yourself. The expense of running these cutting-edge “reasoning” models is currently keeping them at bay for a lot of people. I expect access to widen significantly in 2025. Knowing how to prompt these different kinds of models effectively remains a struggle, and I’d like to see more interface improvements in apps like ChatGPT to help teach people why they should use a reasoning model. An even better move would be to abstract away all these definitions and focus on what tools can do for people. What kind of outlook do you see for Snap in 2025 and beyond? Snap’s biggest problem going into 2025 is the same problem it had going into 2024: its business isn’t growing fast enough. The app itself is bigger than ever and growing quickly, but yearly revenue growth last quarter was less than Meta’s. That’s not a compelling pitch to Wall Street when you are already viewed as the underdog. Even with ads being placed in the Chat tab and the new Spotlight redesign slowly rolling out, the jury is out on if the business can rebound to the pace it needs to this year. A depressed stock price makes it harder to recruit and retain talent, which has become more of a problem for Snap in the last couple of years. I do think the vibe could shift quickly if TikTok does end up being banned in the US or severely hamstrung by a new ownership structure. I continue to be skeptical of Evan Spiegel’s commitment to hardware with Spectacles. As I’ve written before, his foresight and ambition to build AR glasses is admirable. But Snap looks increasingly outgunned in hardware. What do you expect from Meta’s glasses in 2025? There have been a couple of reports recently saying that Meta is planning to ship a pair of smart glasses with a heads-up display this year. I first reported this was going to happen in February 2023. Hypernova, as the product is internally referred to at Meta, will have a viewfinder for interacting with things like Meta AI and notifications. In my write-up of the Orion prototype, I spent a lot of time on the neural wristband because it’s going to ship with Hypernova as a way to control them (while Orion’s commercial successor is still a couple years out at least). I expect this band to be the part of the glasses that surprises people the most. Using it for the first time feels like magic. As I reported in 2023, Meta is also planning a separate smartwatch as an optional upgrade with the neural capability and more features for health tracking, etc. It’s going to be a very interesting year for Meta on the hardware front. Is TikTok going to actually be banned? No one I’ve spoken with who is in a position to know thinks that China will let TikTok be fully divested from ByteDance. The algorithm definitely won’t be sold, but as I’ve explained before, that isn’t as important a factor as it was the last time TikTok was facing a ban. At the same time, there is too much money and power at stake for TikTok to just disappear. President-elect Donald Trump wants to make a deal. The most likely outcome is a different version of the frankensteinian “TikTok Global” joint venture proposal that ByteDance agreed to back in 2020. I could see Oracle staying involved this second time given Larry Ellison’s ongoing influence at Mar-a-Lago. ByteDance will most likely continue running TikTok day-to-day while divesting some of its ownership stake. The real wild card in all this, however, is Elon Musk, who has had serious TikTok envy since he bought X… Are you more bullish or bearish on Google than you were a year ago? Honestly, bullish. It’s going to be difficult to achieve Sundar Pichai’s 2025 mandate of making Gemini a serious rival to ChatGPT on the consumer side, but Google has a fountain of money, the technical talent, and unrivaled distribution. The company’s challenge is more of a cultural one. The more you have, the more you have to protect. It’s hard to get such a large, sprawling conglomerate to move fast and not care about the risk of backlash. Pichai seems well aware of this and the threats he faces, though. Even if Google has to end its Search default payments to Apple (which I predict will be the most likely outcome of the DOJ antitrust case), doing so probably hurt Apple’s bottom line more than Google’s, as Eddy Cue himself argued last week. Then there’s Waymo, which may end up paying for all of Google’s “other bets” failures over the years — and then some. What is a good book you recommend that falls in line with the things you report on? A curse of already reading so much for my job is that I rarely want to spend time on a book. The last book I read in full was The Biggest Bluff by Maria Konnikova, which has nothing to do with tech but is super valuable if you are getting into poker. I enjoyed how her story of becoming a pro player is woven into explaining the technicalities of the game. Three work-related books I have in my Amazon wish list I’m hoping to get to this year: Chip War, The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium, and The Wolves of K Street. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Rivian stock surges to start the year on better-than-expected EV deliveries

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped more than 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period and 51,000 for the year. Rivian stock had a rough 2024. Shares ended the year down 40% from 2023 and nearly 90% from their all-time high above $100 in the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. After its blockbuster IPO three years ago, the Amazon-backed EV maker has faced a mountain of obstacles: First, it grappled with a shortage of necessary computer chips; then, there was a wider market shift away from electric cars just as competition from mainstay Tesla (TSLA) was heating up. The company has undergone a massive cost-cutting campaign, slashing its workforce in multiple rounds of layoffs starting as early as 2022 and redesigning car components to make production less expensive. Even with those efforts, Rivian’s operating losses mounted in the past year. In its third quarter last year, Rivian’s revenue fell for the first time since it went public, dropping 35% to $874 million versus the $980 million expected by analysts as the company faced yet another production disruption thanks to a miscommunication with a key supplier. Rivian’s fourth quarter deliveries number released Friday “affirms that supply issues were isolated to Q3,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan wrote in a note to shareholders Friday. Narayan holds a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hovering around $12 over the next 12 months. The stock was trading above $16 Friday. Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson maintained his Sell rating on Rivian shares, with a price target of just $8, noting Rivian’s “bottom-line losses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.” Rivian will report its full fourth quarter results on Feb. 20.

As the co-founder and general partner at early stage venture capital fund Race Capital, Edith Yeung has had a front-row seat on the development of the crypto sector, particularly in Hong Kong, where she was born and raised. Most notably, she was a seed investor in Solana, investing $250,000 when SOL was valued at just $0.04, and also was an early investor in Lightning Network. Since 2017, Yeung has also authored the China Internet report, an influential annual survey of technology trends in China. Here, Yeung, who will be a speaker at Consensus Hong Kong, discusses Hong Kong’s ongoing development as a crypto hub, her take on China’s stance towards crypto, what she foresees for Solana and one big crypto prediction for 2025.

Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. How do you see crypto regulations developing in HK in 2025? Do you think more crypto companies will become licensed by the SFC in 2025? It’s exciting to see that Hong Kong now has seven SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms. From an investor’s perspective, having a clear licensing regime is a major step forward. Regulatory clarity and predictability are like well-lit roads — they give investors the confidence to drive forward without worrying about unexpected detours. That said, licensing alone isn’t enough. Liquidity is the other critical piece of the puzzle. Think of a trading platform like a brand-new highway: you can have the smoothest pavement and clearest signs, but if no cars are on it, drivers won’t bother. Similarly, no matter how many licenses you have, if there’s no active trading and liquidity, investors will hesitate to come aboard. The key for Hong Kong now is to build not just the infrastructure but the traffic flow — because a great platform without liquidity is like an empty highway going nowhere. What kind of role do you see Hong Kong developing in terms of the crypto sector, especially in relation to the US? What about Asia more broadly? Hong Kong is the New York of Asia. Exchange Square is basically Wall Street — a 24/7 financial powerhouse with soaring skyscrapers and streets full of traders, investors and bankers with energy that never quits. If you are a crypto builder or investor, you will find many TradFi talents (traders, market makers, etc.) in Hong Kong. To build a successful TradFi or DeFi company, you need to recruit specific types of talent that are hard to find even in Silicon Valley. Hong Kong boasts a rich financial history, with its stock market origins dating back to 1866 — over 150 years — means there is a deep pool of experienced professionals who can drive innovation and growth in your venture. What would you say is distinctive about HK/Southeast Asia for crypto compared to the US and Europe? The U.S. is home to the largest crypto addressable market in terms of institutional investors, regulators and builders. But Asia is home to the highest growth potential for the crypto market. In 2024, half of the top 10 countries in the world ranked by crypto adoption were located in Asia. With the new Trump administration, the U.S. will continue to set the tone for crypto regulation and institutional adoption (e.g., BlackRock ETF). Asia will follow their lead with its massive usage base that is young and crypto-native. Do you view China as generally pro or anti-crypto? There’s been a lot of crypto activity there, but at the same time, the government is officially against mining and speculation. Hong Kong is part of China. Seeing pro-crypto regulation slowly forming in Hong Kong is a great sign and indicator for China. That said, China literally has an army of 220 million retail investors sitting on almost $21 trillion worth of savings. With a lingering property crisis and a meek economy, however, it is very difficult to say when China will open up for crypto business again, as the government focuses on these larger issues. You were a seed investor in Solana; do you still have your initial investment there? Do you think Solana will continue to attract as much memecoin activity as it did in 2024? Yes. It was an honor that I got to meet Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal and become their seed investor back in March 2018. I am a long-term Solana holder and supporter. What I love about them is their dedication to building and their support for the developer community. The developer energy at the 2024 Breakpoint conference was high not only because of memecoins. The Firedancer team made huge technical advances last year, and I just love that Anatoly is still head-down geeking out with people like Jump Trading chief science officer Kevin Bowers and his team every day. Even more exciting to me is seeing traditional finance players like Fidelity, Citi and PayPal speaking at Breakpoint about what they are building on Solana. This influx of established players not only validates Solana's future but also signals that blockchain technology is ready for the masses. What kinds of companies are you currently looking to invest in and why? I am a seed investor in Huma Finance — a leader in PayFi building on Solana and a leader in stablecoin infrastructure. In 2024, they did over $2 billion in stablecoin transactions. At Race Capital, we will continue to focus on investing in internet infrastructure. Builders who want to be around long-term do not mind whether it’s an up or down cycle. What’s something you think will happen in 2025 that will surprise crypto folks? The establishment of a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve by the end of 2025. The United States is currently the largest holder of Bitcoin, with approximately 207,189 bitcoins. This effort will be bolstered by this massive stockpile, which is now valued at over $20 billion at current prices. This decision is expected to drive up bitcoin prices, prompting other governments around the world to follow suit. What are you most excited to discuss onstage in Hong Kong? Hong Kong’s role in building the crypto industry in 2025, China's love/hate relationship with crypto and perhaps more insights on Solana.

Title: ByteDance and Trump’s Perplexing TikTok Pirouette
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/01/03/bytedance-and-trumps-perplexing-tiktok-pirouette/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T17:00:00Z

A looming existential crisis confronts TikTok. Come January 19th, a divestiture deadline will kick in unless the Supreme Court intervenes. (Either ByteDance, TikTok’s Beijing-based parent, sells the social media platform with over 1 billion monthly users, or it will be prohibited from operating in the United States.) Nine days earlier, on January 10th, the high court will hear two hours of argument on the platform’s fate. If TikTok loses, app stores like Apple, Google, and others will be barred from offering TikTok to new users—for all intents and purposes, a technological death sentence. This dictum, enacted into law in April, stems from an informed fear that the Chinese Communist Party would use TikTok to access personal data and surveil Americans. “Communications applications that are owned and operated by companies controlled by foreign adversary countries present a clear threat to the national security of the United States,” in the words of a House committee. The TikTok saga showcases tensions within the GOP. First broached by President Donald Trump in a 2020 executive order, the doomsday scenario reappeared last spring. On the other hand, Trump is now boosting TikTok, opposing the ban he once championed. He even credits the app for playing a role in his political resurrection. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points,” he said at a December 16th press conference. “And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” To top it off, he hosted Shou Chew, CEO of TikTok, at Mar-a-Lago that same day. For the record, Trump failed to win the under-30 vote in November, but he did make a strong showing. Regardless, his 2020 executive order painted a bullseye on the app. “The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People’s Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” he declared back then. “Action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application in meticulous, TikTok.” During the 2024 Republican presidential primaries, Nikki Haley—former South Carolina governor and Trump’s first-term U.N. ambassador—saw even more menace in TikTok. Against the backdrop of Hamas’ attack on Israel and campus unrest, she argued that the ubiquitous app purveyed antisemitism. The strictures aimed at TikTok eventually re-emerged as part of a broader aid package to Israel and Ukraine. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as it came to be known, also branded China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as “foreign adversaries”—in case anyone needed reminding. A ton of money is at stake. Goldman Sachs estimates that the app-driven, “creator economy could approach half-a-trillion dollars by 2027.” TikTok is a large but not exclusive part of that. With an American base of 170 million users and creators, it does not intend to lose them. Enter Jeff Yass, co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, a trading company. Its 15 percent stake in ByteDance is valued at about $26 billion. As fate would have it, Susquehanna was also the largest institutional investor in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, aka Truth Social, in late March. (For the record, Susquehanna and other U.S. investment firms, including BlackRock, General Atlantic, and others own 60 percent of ByteDance). Does this explain Trump’s pirouette on ByteDance? The plot thickens. In March, Trump met with Yass and jettisoned his prior hostility to Chinese ownership of the platform. “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” Trump posted to Truth Social. The competitor of my adversary is my friend, so to speak. “I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,” he added. “They are a true Enemy of the People!” On X, Elon Musk trumpeted the sentiment: “Trump’s statement there is correct.” With a significant presence in China, Musk may be loath to offend Xi and the country’s other leaders, regardless of whether TikTok is a competitor to his X platform. By late spring, TikTok and ByteDance commenced a legal challenge to the ban, arguing that the legislative attack failed constitutional muster. Amicus briefs transcended the usual liberal-conservative and left-right divides. To illustrate, Zephyr Teachout, a Bernie Sanders backer and former challenger to Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York, who has written for this magazine, joined a friends-of-court brief backing the government filed by Mark Meador, a former aide to Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican, and a one-time fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Matt Stoller, a former staffer to Sanders on the Senate budget committee and an antitrust advocate, was also aboard. Likewise, a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress backed the law. Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State; Elise Stefanik, Trump’s choice for U.N. ambassador; and Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, supported it, along with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Ritchie Torres, and Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic senator-elect from Michigan. On the other half of the divide, the libertarian Cato Institute (a beneficiary of Yass’ largesse), the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, the Asian American Federation, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and the Muslim Public Affairs Council all backed TikTok. Intellectual and demographic diversity filled the air. Earlier in December, a three-judge appellate panel ruled against Yass & Co. “The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here, the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, wrote. “As the government details and petitioners do not dispute, the PRC engages in an aggressive, global campaign of influence operations against U.S. interests, relying heavily on the internet and social-media platforms.” Significantly, the court also noted that the judiciary traditionally defers to the executive branch’s and Congress’s judgment on national security matters. In those circumstances, the “government’s ‘evaluation of the facts’ is ‘entitled to deference,’” Ginsburg opined. By extension, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will declare the TikTok ban unconstitutional—a reminder, in 2018, the Roberts court deferred to executive prerogative and upheld the so-called Muslim travel ban. With national security front and center, reversal here appears unlikely. Regardless of the outcome, tensions between the U.S. and China remain on the front burner. To avoid a government shutdown, Congress removed a provision from the recent continuing resolution that would have curbed American investment in China. In the eyes of House Democrats, Musk’s nexus to Beijing played a major role in scuttling the initial budget deal. Fun fact: Musk’s Tesla is the sole foreign auto manufacturer permitted to operate in China without a local partner. “His bottom line depends on staying in China’s good graces,” Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote of the world’s richest man. “He wants to build an AI data center there, too—which could endanger U.S. security. He’s been bending over backward to ingratiate himself with Chinese leaders.” Representative Rosa DeLauro, a senior Connecticut Democrat, took things further in a letter, writing: “It is particularly disturbing that Musk may have sought to upend this critical negotiated agreement to remove a bipartisan provision regulating U.S. investments in China in order to protect his wallet and the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of American workers, innovators, and businesses.” In turn, Musk called for the soon-to-be 18-term member’s expulsion from the House, labeling DeLauro an “awful creature.” As for Trump, his relationship with speech rights remains strained. In case anyone forgot, in January 2018, Trump threw a brushback pitch at author Michael Wolff over Fire and Fury, the first of multiple tell-alls emanating from his White House. Without citing any particular false content or national security concerns, Trump threatened legal action after The Guardian published pre-release excerpts from the book. No one confused Fire and Fury with the Pentagon Papers, and no one should assume Trump’s latest position on TikTok will be his last. Trump is undoubtedly mindful that popular support for restricting TikTok is minimal. Less than one-third of Americans support the ban, down from half in March 2023—the shift cuts across party lines. Republican backing for restrictions on TikTok waned from 60 percent to 42 percent. Democrats saw a similar double-digit slide, from 43 percent to 24 percent. No wonder he asked the Supreme Court to delay argument in the TikTok case until after he assumed the presidency. Ironically, a loss for Yass, TikTok, and Trump at the Court would still present the president-elect with a silver lining—more power. If the Court upholds the ban, it will feed Trump’s expansive views of executive power and his authority, even if the issue here is a legislative ban, because it’ll widen the court’s leeway for national security considerations when it comes to speech. In case anyone forgot, he has already mused about being a dictator for at least a day. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Kick Off 2025 Trading in The Red. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) stands against the other stocks. The stock market finished the first trading day of the year in the negative territory—a fifth straight day, over the lack of catalysts to spark trading appetite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down the most by 0.36 percent, the S&P 500 decreased 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.16 percent. Ten companies also kicked off trading mirroring the broader market downturn. In this article, let's explore the reasons behind their decline. To come up with Thursday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A group of millennials playing an online game on their mobile devices. Video streaming platform Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) saw its share price on Thursday decline by 5.41 percent or 0.98 points to end at $17.13 following disappointing earnings results. According to the company, it generated $1.019 billion in revenues but reported a net loss of $11.09 million, resulting in an earnings per share of -$0.03 and a gross profit of $355 million. The company earlier expected to post a final loss in 2024 before swinging to profitability in 2025. According to analysts, they expect the company to grow 82 percent year-on-year, on average. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected. Overall BILI ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks that crashed yesterday. While we acknowledge the potential of BILI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BILI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: A 10%-Yielding Alternative To Stocks For 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/01/03/a-10-yielding-alternative-to-stocks-for-2025/

Asset allocation dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories. For a long time now, it seems like the stock market has had a “theme of the year.” Clearly in 2024 it was AI, while 2023 was the year of recovery from 2022, which was a year of panic over a recession that never came. This is odd, as past trends have lasted several years. From 2012 to 2014, for example, it was momentum driven by the Fed’s quantitative easing after the financial crisis. And the dot-com-bubble years spanned more or less from 1994 to 2000. So will 2025 be another “theme year,” or will we see markets shift back to embracing longer-term trends? (Hint: I’m expecting the former, and we’re going to front-run the main theme I see for 2025 to grab ourselves some nice 10%+ dividends paid monthly.) A quick glance at 2024 offers some clues as to where things are headed. Bull Market Above we see the performance of the benchmark index funds for the S&P 500 (in purple) and NASDAQ 100 (in orange), as of this writing. As you can see, the NASDAQ and S&P 500 rose almost the same amount. That’s surprising; we’d expect the NASDAQ’s tilt toward AI names like Amazon.com (AMZN), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) to propel it ahead of the S&P 500. But things are, of course, more complicated than that. For one, consider that 61% of large American companies are planning to use AI to automate tasks. In other words, it’s not just tech benefiting from AI, but firms from across the entire economy. This is good for the whole market, so it’s not surprising that the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 would more or less keep pace with one another. The S&P 500 now has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 28, a level it’s only reached a few times in the last 40 years: late 2019, mid 2008, early 2001 and late 1997. Each of these peaks, unfortunately, came right before a bear market. However, there is good news here. First, in 2001, 2008 and 2019, these peaks were hit after a bear market had already begun. In other words, the market hit this high valuation because earnings fell, decreasing the “E” in the P/E ratio and driving up the number overall. So today isn’t really comparable to those eras. The bad news, though, is that 1997 was like today. At the height of the dot-com bubble, stocks priced in future gains that didn’t appear. If AI flops, we could see a similar correction to the one that occurred in the late 1990s. The problem is that there’s no way to know if that pullback will happen in 2025 or, say, 2030 (or at all). So selling now could result in lost money in the long term. With all this in mind, my prediction is this: 2025 will be the year more investors look beyond stocks, particularly for ways to profit from the still-strong market while hedging their downside. That path leads straight to corporate bonds, which yield 7.3% as I write this, for companies with credit ratings of BB+ or below. And our favorite income plays, closed-end funds (CEFs), let us tap corporate bonds for even higher dividends to the tune of 10%+. Our play, then, is to front-run the crowd into these funds, which include the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), a CEF yielding 10.1% that pays dividends monthly. When it comes to high-yield bonds, many people irrationally worry about defaults. But here’s the truth: Even in the worst crisis, default rates would only spike to around 10%, so if you buy a CEF like GHY, which has bonds from 405 different issuers, you’d sharply limit your risk of loss. Bear in mind, too, that the fund is run by five portfolio managers from Prudential (PRU), a company with a deep bench of talent and resources, providing even more reassurance here. Moreover, the default rates on high-yield bonds are currently around 1%—imperceptible in most CEFs, including GHY. This little-known fund is also well diversified across sectors: GHY Holdings GHY is also well diversified around the world, with a strong base (47.5% of assets) in the US. That’s a nice setup for 2025, when interest rates are expected to decline in the US, sending capital looking for higher returns elsewhere. Also, the fund yields 10.1%, and that yield is pretty reliable, as GHY hasn’t reduced distributions in five years, and in 2024 it out-earned its payouts, suggesting dividends remain covered. Then there’s the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV). This is the main CEF valuation metric, and right now GHY is discounted, trading at 4.7% below its portfolio value. That discount faded steadily through 2024 before plateauing at its current level in November. If 2025 boosts demand from investors looking for high-yield alternatives to stocks, as I expect it to, GHY’s discount could shrink further. But even if demand holds steady, GHY still has reason to climb, thanks to its strong long-term performance history. As you can see below, GHY (in purple) has more than doubled the corporate-bond benchmark index fund (in orange) over the last decade: GHY Outperforms Double-digit yields and this wind at the fund’s back are strong selling points, with the high price of stocks sealing the deal. Add in the diversification away from stocks that GHY provides, and the fund is an attractive option now. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Nvidia stock jumps, leads 'Magnificent 7' gains to start 2025 after end-of-year tech sell-off

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024. Shares of the AI chipmaker rose 4.5% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board in the absence of a “Santa Claus" rally, where the stock market typically enjoys a surge between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%, and Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares still ended 2024 up more than 150%. Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Bank of America’s Vivek Arya told Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast Thursday that broader market forces and company-specific issues drove the sell-off in Nvidia stock late last year. "What we have seen in the market is a rotation of money from semiconductors to software," Arya said, noting that the latter was less exposed to US trade restrictions on goods to and from China. He added that for Nvidia, "the last two quarters have not been clean, really, because they're going through growing pains from one generation of product that was Hopper to the new generation of product." Arya was referring to concerns surrounding delays in shipments of the company's new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. "In our view, these are short-term issues," he said. That could create a buying opportunity: While its Magnificent Seven peers are trading at two times their average earnings growth estimates for 2025, Arya noted that Nvidia shares are trading at less than one times the consensus earnings growth for the company this upcoming year. Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock and sees shares rising to $190 over the next 12 months. Shares of Nvidia and its Magnificent Seven peers have benefited from investors' massive bets on artificial intelligence, as well as earnings growth. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported, through roughly three-quarters of reports, the combination of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia grew earnings year over year by 33% in 2024, compared to just 4.2% growth for the other 493 S&P 500 companies, per FactSet data. To be sure, skeptics warn of a bubble that could burst and send AI-fueled stocks tumbling if hype over the new technology fades and Big Tech's spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure wanes. Wall Street analysts overall remain convinced the AI enthusiasm will continue, however. Tesla also notched a notable gain Friday, jumping more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta rose around 1%, while Amazon spiked nearly 2%. Apple shares were roughly flat. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

GM’s results come as crosstown rival Ford also saw sales gain in Q4 and for the year. What is Turo, the peer-to-peer car rental app used in the deadly Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks?

Here's what was so positive about what Microsoft had to say, and why it may have tamped down some recent market fears. In a blog post this morning, Microsoft Vice President Brad Smith wrote bullishly on the prospects and importance of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia rose above the 50-day moving average Friday and hit an early buy point at 141.90. Does that mean Nvidia stock is a buy now? On Monday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang will deliver the keynote address at CES 2025 at 6:30 p.m. The event can be viewed on Nvidia's website. The past couple of years have been prosperous for the stock market, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) surging by more than 64% since late 2022, as of this writing. While there's no way to tell exactly where the stock market will be a few months or a year from now, history suggests there's very good news about the future. It's easy to get caught up in the stock market's day-to-day fluctuations, and those ups and downs can be anxiety-inducing. WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Elon Musk's SpaceX said on Friday its upcoming Starship test flight would include the rocket's first attempt to deploy payloads in space by releasing 10 model Starlink satellites, a key demonstration for Starship's potential in the satellite launch market. "While in space, Starship will deploy 10 Starlink simulators, similar in size and weight to next-generation Starlink satellites as the first exercise of a satellite deploy mission," SpaceX said in a blog post on its website.

Farside Investors data shows that on Jan. 2 IBIT saw $333 million worth of outflows—the highest ever reported for the Bitcoin ETF. Founder of Obchakevich Research Alex Obchakevich told Decrypt that “the main reason for the outflow is profit-taking by investors in early 2025.” “At the end of the year, investors and funds often review their investment portfolios, which can lead to the sale of some shares,” he explained. U.S.-based BTC spot ETFs overall lost $248 million on Jan. 2. IBIT was the top loser, followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with its $23 million in withdrawals—the only other product to report a negative capital net flow. Isaac Joshua—the CEO of token launch platform Gems—also told Decrypt yesterday that the recent downturn “can largely be attributed to end-of-year tax-loss harvesting by investors,” he explained. According to him, “many have liquidated both Bitcoin ETFs and the underlying asset itself to optimize their tax reports, a common phenomenon in financial markets during this period.” Still, investors remain optimistic about BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Ryan Lee—chief analyst at the research subsidiary of crypto exchange Bitget—recently highlighted in a note that “BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF is poised to accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption by simplifying access for institutional investors, enhancing its legitimacy and facilitating mainstream acceptance.” IBIT surpassed $50 billion in assets under management just 228 days after its launch—more than five times faster than any other ETF in history. “By bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency, the ETF is expected to stabilize BTC's market perception and potentially reduce price volatility,” Joshua said. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data indicates that Bitcoin is trading at just under $96,700 after gaining 0.11% over the last 24 hours and 0.35% over the last seven days. The current price is nearly 10.7% lower than the all-time high of nearly $108,300 reported on Dec. 17. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Investors placed bets on shares of Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NYSE:NUS) at pre-market trading to buoy its prices by nearly 17 percent following news that it raised $250 million from the sale of its affiliate marketing technology platform. Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik On Friday, Nu Skin (NUS), through its subsidiary Rhyz Inc. said it completed the sale of the Mavely affiliate marketing platform to Later, a company backed by Summit Partners for $250 million. The deal included both cash and a minor equity stake in the company. Proceeds from the transaction are expected to be used to pay down debt and fund additional innovation. According to data from InvestingPro, the transaction value represents 75 percent of Nu Skin’s (NUS) current market capitalization of $326.1 million, with analysis indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. Mavely is set to merge with Later following the transaction. Approximately $33 million will be paid to other equity holders in the Mavely business. The transaction is expected to provide Nu Skin (NUS) with enhanced capabilities as it continues to develop a beauty, wellness, and lifestyle ecosystem. “Together, we believe Later and Mavely will provide enhanced capabilities to our company as we pursue our broader beauty, wellness, and lifestyle ecosystem vision, while the transaction generates additional capital and resources for us to increase innovation in our core Nu Skin business and investment in our Rhyz companies,” Nu Skin (NUS) President and Chief Executive Officer Ryan Napierski said. “This underscores the value of Rhyz to incubate and scale meaningful businesses with synergistic value across the enterprise,” he added. The transaction was said to have generated an approximate five times return on Nu Skin’s (NUS) cumulative investment in Mavely since acquiring the latter in 2021. The company also plans to use its strengthened balance sheet to buy back stock under its existing stock repurchase program, providing value to its shareholders. Nu Skin (NUS) is an integrated beauty and wellness company that operates in nearly 50 markets worldwide. It boasts of brands including Nu Skin personal care, Pharmanex nutrition, and ageLOC anti-aging.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform."

US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data.

US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index.

Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE).

Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.

Title: Analyst raises Tesla price target, maintains Buy rating despite deliveries miss

Canaccord Genuity has lifted its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock price target to $404 from $298, maintaining a Buy rating despite weaker-than-expected deliveries in the fourth quarter. The move comes as the financial services firm remains confident about the carmaker’s long-term growth potential and the upcoming product launches. According to Canaccord’s Thursday note, the new target price is based on 40x Canaccord’s 2027E non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $10.11, compared to a previous multiple of ~34x on 2026E EPS. “We feel this multiple is justified based on the multiples and growth rates of Tesla’s comp set — which we deem to be a group of megacap tech stocks, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA),” analyst George Gianarikas said in the note. “This set of companies trades at a median of ~23x 2027E EPS but has a combined revenue growth rate ~half of Tesla’s from 2025-2027,” he added. Tesla’s latest delivery results were below expectations. The company reported 4Q24 deliveries of around 495,600, representing 7.1% sequential growth but falling short of Canaccord’s estimate of ~533,000 and the consensus estimate of ~498,000. Tesla’s production in the same quarter declined by 2.2% sequentially to ~459,500 units. Canaccord’s decision to maintain its bullish stance centers on new product introductions slated for 2025. Tesla has guided for new vehicles and anticipates 20-30% year-over-year unit volume growth. “Tesla tends to deliver excitement when it refreshes its portfolio,” the note stated. This growth potential, combined with signs of bottoming auto gross margins, supports Canaccord’s positive outlook. Tesla reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100 in 3Q24, the lowest in the company’s history. “We’ll see how new products impact the mix — but we do forecast improving margins in 2025,” Gianarikas said. Canaccord also highlighted advances in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. While the firm remains cautious about timelines for robotaxi deployments, recent updates to FSD have been described as “unbelievable, incredible” by users, signaling potential for higher adoption rates. “An increase in FSD adoption could positively impact Tesla's profit margins and bolster confidence in the company's ability to monetize its substantial investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure,” the analyst continued. Moreover, Tesla’s energy storage segment remains a bright spot. Deployments surged to about 11.0 GWh in 4Q24, up 59.4% sequentially and 243.5% year-over-year. The construction of Tesla’s Shanghai Megafactory was completed in late 2024, and production is expected to ramp up in 1Q25. Lastly, Canaccord points to the potential in the robotics sector for Tesla, emphasizing it sees 2025 “as the year of the robot.” “We see increasing support for Tesla’s earnings multiple based on its leadership in this burgeoning sector.”

Title: A $24 Billion Fund Puts Its Religious Stamp on Corporate America

Jim Lake, a devout Christian in Washington state, said his religious beliefs have always made him opposed to practices such as abortion, transgender transitions or embryonic stem cell research. But until this past year, it didn’t cross the retiree’s mind that he could put his money to work with his faith. A financial adviser switched Lake’s portfolio over to a handful of faith-friendly funds, one of which was run by GuideStone Funds, a 106-year-old investment firm in Texas that oversees some $24 billion in assets. The company caters to Southern Baptist retirees and, increasingly, newly active faith-based investors such as Lake and his wife. GuideStone is part of a nascent coalition of conservative Christian investors that are starting to flex their muscles and use their shareholder clout to counter progressive corporate policies such as funding Pride parades or covering employees’ travel costs for abortions. They’re also zeroing in on banks for allegedly closing customer accounts on political and religious grounds. By some measures, there’s now half a trillion dollars in investments spread across conservative faith-based private funds and state pension funds that can be brought to bear to influence company behavior, said Will Lofland, who oversees shareholder advocacy at GuideStone. The loose confederation includes Inspire Investing, the biggest faith-based exchange-traded fund manager; Republican state treasurers and teacher pension funds; and Alliance Defending Freedom, an influential conservative legal group. As they attract more money, members of the coalition are meeting with corporate executives and filing shareholder proposals. They’ve had limited success so far, yet aim to build their bloc of supporters and target more companies this year, Lofland said. The investors “want to honor the Lord with all of their resources,” he said. “They want their dollars being invested in what they believe is the God-honoring way.” Religious investing has been around for decades, often with a focus on more liberal issues such as worker rights and climate change. But funds such as GuideStone have been emboldened by the rightward shift of US politics and the wave of conservative activists and lawyers who have already pushed companies to curtail or end programs that support diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Many point to anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck, a non-denominational Christian, and his success in getting companies such as Walmart Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Harley-Davidson Inc. to backtrack on initiatives — particularly those related to LGBTQ causes. Among everyday investors, there is growing interest in religious-based funds, said Tim Macready, head of global multi asset investing at Brightlight, which advises investors on faith-based portfolios. Assets in faith-friendly ETFs and mutual funds exceeded $100 billion for the first time last year, according to annual study conducted by the firm. The analysis, compiled from 27 faith-based asset mangers, likely captures only a portion of the activity. The full universe could range from $200 billion to $500 billion, Macready said. Net inflows have been 12% over the last three years, he said. One broker-dealer went from 200 advisers working with GuideStone in 2021 to more than 2,000 now, Lofland said. Inspire said it had net new assets of $334 million last year. GuideStone’s biggest fund, the GuideStone Equity Index Fund, gained 20% last year, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Lake, a 64-year-old resident of Nine Mile Falls, Washington, invested with GuideStone after being introduced to an adviser whose sole practice is working with people investing in faith-friendly funds. “It really opened up my eyes to the ability to remain faith-friendly and at the same time, be competitive,” Lake said. Building a Bloc GuideStone operates out of a nondescript office building overlooking a freeway in northern Dallas, and maintained such a low profile that Lofland said he didn’t know about the funds until he applied to work there. The firm mainly manages pension investments for Baptist churches, yet Lofland saw an opportunity to become more active. Shareholder proposals from progressive groups, some pushing ideas such as transgender benefits contrary to the church’s values, started to proliferate a few years ago and GuideStone wasn’t voting its shares to oppose such measures, Lofland said. He decided to take control of how GuideStone voted on the shares it owns in companies rather than relying on outside advisers. One of the investor’s first efforts was in late 2023, when it backed a shareholder proposal from a conservative group asking Microsoft Corp. to report on compensation and benefit gaps across genders as the company addressed reproductive and gender dysphoria care. The resolution won only 1% of votes. (Bloomberg Intelligence says overall support for conservative proposals at US companies is only about 2%.) Lofland says that’s why the religious funds need to build a bigger group of supporters, particularly from pension funds from conservative states. Such investors have already done some agitating of their own: Last year, finance officials from 15 states signed a letter to Fortune 1000 companies in support of ending DEI programs. Collectively, they managed about $590 billion, according to US Census data. That type of firepower is needed to counter efforts that have strong progressive backing. In July, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander urged five large retailers, including Walmart and Costco Wholesale Corp., to dispense abortion pills. City funds controlled $1.3 billion in shares of those companies, he said. A coalition of conservatives and religious investors, including Inspire and GuideStone, responded with their own letter the following month saying offering the pill would add risk, but only represented $172 million in shares of those retailers. Lofland said GuideStone’s first initiative in 2025 will be to press a financial firm regarding the practice of debanking — the closure of customer accounts that are deemed by lenders to pose legal or reputational risks. He declined to name the bank. GuideStone had previously supported other group’s efforts to pressure JPMorgan Chase & Co. after the lender was accused of improperly closing accounts for the nonprofit National Committee for Religious Freedom. Michael Fusco, a spokesman for the bank, said “we have never and would never close an account for political or religious reasons, period.” Lawsuits, Proxy Votes Inspire Investing and Knights of Columbus are among other faith-based investors working to influence corporate behavior. Inspire joined a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group run by Trump advisor Stephen Miller against Target Corp. that accuses the retailer of costing investors billions of dollars after its sale of LGBTQ merchandise led to a consumer boycott. Last month, a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the case and change its venue out of Florida. Target, which in response cut LGBTQ-themed products from some its stores, declined to comment. Inspire, which oversees about $3.2 billion, last year filed almost two dozen shareholder resolutions over DEI topics. It plans to file more in 2025. “As stewards of what we believe are God’s dollars, it’s our job to speak Biblical truth to corporate power,” said Robert Netzly, founder of the Meridian, Idaho-based investment firm. Knights of Columbus is working to develop proxy voting rules that follow guidelines established by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Anthony Minopoli, president and chief investment officer of Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors, which manages about $28 billion. The group is partnering with the Busch School of Business at the Catholic University of America on the effort, which aims to get Catholic dioceses to adopt the guidelines to ensure they are voting based on the beliefs of the church. The group also will likely engage with companies on topics ranging from abortion to the manufacture of land mines and cluster bombs, which violate church values as set forward by USCCB, Minopoli said. Even if the coalitions of conservative and religious groups don’t get strong shareholder support for their proposals, they will likely succeed in swaying corporate executives, according to Amelia Miazad, an acting law professor at University of California, Davis who is researching a project on faith-based investors. She likened the efforts to the backlash to environmental, social and governance strategies, which has seen asset management giants including BlackRock Inc. cut the number of new funds with that mandate. “If success means silencing corporate speech on environmental and social issues, then these investors will be as successful as the anti-ESG movement has been,” she said.

Title: Incorporating earned value management into income statements to improve project management profitability and elevate application in the business and management
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0312956

Our goal is to improve Project Management (PM) profitability and reduce discrepancies in information among stakeholders, which can result in conflicts. This will be accomplished by incorporating Earned Value Management (EVM) with the Income Statement and incorporating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with the work breakdown structure (WBS). These incorporations will streamline information sharing between PM, other management professionals, and the stakeholders, ultimately fostering the application of PM within broader business and management contexts. We drew on theories from Project, Operations, Financial Management, Agency Theory, and the Theory of Performance Frontiers. We conducted multiple case studies in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. Our analysis involved both qualitative and quantitative methods, ensuring the accuracy and practicality of our hypotheses and instilling confidence in our research findings. This integration addresses the information gap on profitability for non-project management professionals, empowering stakeholders to enhance project performance. This integration benefits the company by allowing the project manager and stakeholders to gain real-time insights into the project’s profitability, which enables continuous optimization of daily EBITDA by improving efficiency and productivity to achieve the project’s profitability target. This study and its innovative findings originate from the author’s unique approach, which is a significant contribution to the field of Project Management. This research focused on project management using EVM in for-profit organizations. Integrating EVM in the income statement also facilitates PM application in other management systems.

Project management is a well-established field that deals with complex tasks within tight constraints [1, 2]. It is integral to modern management with strong theoretical foundations and scientific rigor [3–5]. Despite its importance, project management research receives little attention in leading business and management journals. The project management manifesto encourages collaboration between social scientists and urges business and management experts to make project research more relevant to society [3]. The use of EVM in project management has grown but is not widely accepted in business due to its limitations in addressing quality, uncertainty, and profitability [2, 3]. Current EVM indicators are limited and need enhancement. Profitability measurements are missing, creating a lack of real-time awareness among project managers and potential conflicts with stakeholders [4]. Upon analysis, it’s clear that EVM lacks profitability indicators. This hampers managers’ real-time understanding of project profitability, leading to reliance on financial reports later. This knowledge gap among managers can create conflicts. Our research suggests integrating EBITDA into EVM to maximize daily EBITDA in all processes, WBS, and work packages for improved performance and profitability. Our study utilized multiple embedded case studies within complex defense industries in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. We collected and analyzed qualitative data through NVivo interviews and quantitative data through SPSS surveys. Data collection took place over a longitudinal time horizon. We aim to improve EVM by integrating it into the income statement and linking EBITDA to WBS and work packages to provide timely profitability information, enhance daily performance, and broaden the practical application of project management. This research has implications for real-world implementation in business and management. This study focuses on both profit-driven and not-for-profit organizations, as both need to secure operational earnings for sustainable success. However, the study does not delve into the measurement of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in project management, nor does it explore the role of project management in valuations such as mergers and acquisitions. The novelty of this research lies in integrating EVM into the income statement and EBITDA into the WBS, enhancing project management profitability and applying EVM–PM in other business and management fields, which is the author’s innovation. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1, Introduction, and Section 2. Literature Review and Section 3 Research Methods. Then we will have Section 4, Result and Discussion, and finally, Section 5 is the conclusion. The upcoming section will provide a comprehensive review of how to enhance Project Management (PM) profitability and elevate PM applications in other business and management fields. Firstly, we will explore project-based firms (PBF), projects, and Earned Value Management (EVM), including components such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Packages. We will also delve into Agency Theory, which covers the roles of principals (Project Owners) and agents (Contractors) and how information gaps about profitability can lead to conflicts among stakeholders. Additionally, we will discuss the disparity between PM language and financial literacy, such as Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) among stakeholders, and its impact on information asymmetry using the theory of Productivity Frontiers. To address Research Question 1, we need to answer research questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 to understand the practical application of EVM in business management. Therefore, we will delve into topics such as Project Based Firm (PBF), Agency Theory, and Information Asymmetry in Section 2.1. Fig 1 visually presents the five steps to incorporate Project Management EVM with the Income Statement. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g001 In section 2.2, our focus is on the integration of EVM into the Income Statement, a crucial step to improve Project Management profitability. In Section 2.3, we will explore the appropriateness of EBITDA as the Primary Profitability indicator of PM. Section 2.4 will discuss how to integrate EVM–Income Statement and EBITDA to enhance profitability, and Section 2.5 will delve into how to maximize PM daily EBITDA. Furthermore, section 2.6 will discuss the benefit of using EBITDA in the EVM-PM. Section 2.7 will discuss enhancing EVM-Income Statement—EBITDA in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to support PM. Additionally, we will organize the literature from section 2.1 until section 2.5 and define the boundary of the study that focuses on PM from the agents (contractors’) perspectives and exclude the discussion of project owner benefits that may result from the project usage after PM completion. We also exclude discussing managing interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization for corporation valuations. Finally, in section 2.8, we will summarize how to elevate PM applications by integrating EVM with income statements and WBS—EBITDA into other business and management fields and summarize the hypothesis we built during the literature review. Project management is a complex field that aims to deliver cost-effective, high-quality, timely, and safe products [4, 6–10]. Frontier analysis identifies best-in-class companies and areas for improvement, driving continuous improvement and providing a competitive advantage [11]. We will explore how to enhance the use of EVM beyond project management and traditional methods [4], to prioritize project management efficiency, productivity, and profitability from the outset. Project management is crucial for project-based firms (PBFs) to enhance employee performance and execute projects effectively [2]. It extends to encompass internal and external stakeholders with diverse expectations [3]. Agency theory provides insights into inter-organizational relationships, highlighting the importance of aligning the principal’s and agent’s value propositions to achieve optimal project management outcomes [12]. Prioritizing diverse stakeholders and promoting transparent communication are essential. Information asymmetry arises when one party possesses information they do not openly share. However, such information asymmetry can give rise to opportunistic behavior [13, 14], typically exhibited by the agent [15] and sometimes by the principal [16]. RQ1. How can a company integrate EVM into Income Statement to improve Project Management Profitability and elevate application in the Business and Management? To answer Research Question 1 (RQ1), we split it into three RQ as follows: Further we will study the literature to answer RQ1. 1 by studying seven layers of Income Statements (I/S) framework. The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, is a vital financial reporting tool for businesses and management, providing crucial insights into costs, benefits, and operational profitability [17–21]. The seven-step income statement structure, depicted in Fig 1, serves as a valuable framework. The process starts with revenue, direct operating costs, and gross profit, a key measure of operational profitability. However, it is important to note that gross profit does not account for indirect operating costs [22], and should not be the sole measure of operating profitability. On the other hand, EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) includes all operating costs, including depreciation and amortization. Although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs, they are not directly controlled by project managers but rather by the board of directors (BOD) [23, 24]. Thus, we do not recommend using EBIT as a profitability objective for daily project management activities, as daily depreciation and amortization are fixed costs not within the control of project managers. EBITDA includes direct and indirect operating costs but excludes interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Company EBITDA is solely under company operational control, and PM EBITDA is under project managers’ control. EBITDA can be used to measure operational efficiency, productivity, and profitability [24, 25], making it a valuable key performance indicator (KPI) for project management. Our next step will be to delve into its suitability as a KPI in PM and investigate how to integrate EVM with the income statement framework. It is essential to recognize the significance of PM profitability for its success, growth, and continual operation [26]. Thus, it is crucial to grasp the terminology of profitability measures in Earned Value Management (EVM) and align them with the profit and loss framework, as depicted in Fig 2. EVM is a comprehensive system that compares actual and budgeted work values, time, and costs. Through the integration of time and cost perspectives, EVM assesses schedule and cost performance, calculates variances, and forecasts total cost and duration [2, 7, 27–33]. (Author’s property). (Author’s property). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g002 Fig 2 illustrates several EVM indicators, including Planned Value (PV) as the "budgeted cost of work scheduled" (BCWS), Earned Value (EV) as the "budgeted cost of work performed" (BCWP), and Actual Costs (AC) as the "actual costs of work performed" (ACWP) [27, 29–32, 34, 35]. The Earned Value Management (EVM) method lacks profitability indicators, leading to information imbalances among stakeholders. Integrating profitability indicators into EVM will enhance transparency and support from stakeholders [18]. Additionally, the EVM method does not consider revenue, using the term "budget" instead, necessitating the inclusion of a baseline for production and profitability [26]. The interpretation of Planned Value (PV) varies based on perspective. For effective management of profit-driven organizations, it is crucial for a contractor’s planned cost to differ from the planned revenue received from the owner. Setting a zero-profitability target may not motivate project managers to prioritize profit, and an unclear buffer between revenue and cost may lead to cost overruns. Project managers (PMs) can utilize EBITDA as a buffer between revenues and costs to address this issue. This buffer can be represented by the equation: Planned cost = planned revenue minus planned EBITDA. By integrating the EBITDA target as a profitability goal, the project manager can effectively manage profitability and intervene early if necessary [33, 36]. Moreover, incorporating buffer into the EVM system can positively impact profitability [37]. In Fig 2, we illustrate the integration of EVM into the Income Statement and the incorporation of EBITDA into the framework. Incorporating EBITDA into EVM can streamline accounting processes and enable direct project performance management. However, it’s important to evaluate the relevance of using EBITDA as a KPI in project management before implementation [38, 39]. Within this framework, our objective was to verify the suitability of EBITDA as a KPI in PM. In addressing the second research question, we explore the significance of profitability for project management activities and introduce some terminology related to operational profitability. Fig 3 vividly illustrates the seven crucial steps of an Income Statement. It begins with sales activity, effectively generating revenue. The next step involves the Company’s core operations, which consume direct operational costs, encompassing both variable and fixed costs, culminating in the creation of gross profit. The third step involves the Company Supporting Units engaging in Indirect Operations activities, such as General Administration, and consuming Indirect Operating Costs resulting in EBITDA (Earnings Before interest, depreciation, and amortization). Finally, the decision to expense Depreciation and Amortization by the Board of Directors leads to EBIT (Earnings Before Interests and Tax), also called Operating Profit [25, 40]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g003 Noticeably, the Company’s operations management authority is confined to specific operational expenses, as control over Depreciation and Amortization expenses rests with the Board of Directors. The decision to account for Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax falls within the Board of Directors’ purview, limiting the Operations Management’s jurisdiction to EBITDA. Consequently, operations management has no complete control over operating profit expenses because it excludes depreciation from its jurisdiction. The ultimate earnings that operations management can deliver is EBITDA [25, 40]. The frontier approach assesses performance using managerial benchmarks and theoretical perspectives. The production frontier represents the highest level of performance achievable by an operational unit based on its operational decisions (Vastag, 2000). EBITDA can be a critical operational management performance indicator (KPI), representing the profitability frontier under their direct control. In addition, Fig 3 illustrates the correlations between earnings metrics, such as Earning Before Tax (EBT), Earnings After Tax (EAT) or Net Profit, and Retained Earnings, and management authority and control. This illustration highlights the essential role of operational management in achieving profitability and control [25, 40]. Critics of EBITDA as a company indicator argue that it is an inadequate measure for evaluating investment activities since it requires consideration of other indicators and is not a reliable proxy for net cash flow [41]. Additionally, some argue that EBITDA is insufficient for guiding financial strategies and valuation decisions such as bankruptcy, mergers, and acquisitions [42–45]. On the other hand, advocates of EBITDA as an indicator maintain that it is a suitable measure of a company’s operations and project management profitability, reflecting the ultimate profitability that only operations management and project management can achieve [41, 46–50]. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a crucial metric used to gauge the achievement of critical objectives and is essential for understanding and enhancing performance [51]. EBITDA is a performance metric that assesses a company’s profitability by excluding factors such as taxes, interest, and debt costs [23, 52]. It is a reliable indicator of operational effectiveness and is well-suited as a profitability metric for evaluating operational management [53]. It’s important to align performance dimensions with company practices such as knowledge management, openness, and sustainability [54]. Performance measurement involves assessing effectiveness and efficiency using specific measures [55]. EBITDA is crucial for operational management and integrating it into earned value management (EVM) can help project managers plan and control financial targets. An effective performance management system should incorporate a limited number of KPIs to provide a comprehensive view of company performance and prevent information overload [55]. Integrating EBITDA into EVM allows project managers to plan and control financial targets effectively. Based on this review, we establish the following hypotheses: In this section, we will delve into integrating EBITDA into EVM for project management, which addresses the third research question. Our focus will be on exploring the incorporation of EBITDA measures to maximize daily EBITDA within EVM, and we will pose two important questions: 1. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS enable active profitability management? 2. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS streamline operations and project management while increasing profitability? To address these inquiries, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of various EVM performance indicators and devised a strategy for integrating EBITDA into the current system. EBITDA is crucial as a performance metric not only to gauge performance but also to facilitate the formulation of improvement initiatives [54]. Performance indicators play a vital role in enabling companies to evaluate their systems’ adherence to standards and progress toward specific objectives [56]. Using key performance indicators such as EBITDA empowers managers to adeptly guide the company towards enhancement, make well-informed decisions, and incentivize and reward employees. With technological advancements, it is now feasible to collect data and analyze the most pertinent variables in real time to assess key performance indicators [51]. Fig 4 depicts the S-Curve EVM project management from the project owner’s viewpoint, wherein PV represents the Planned Value equivalent to the Planned Costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g004 The Budget Actual Costs (BAC) represent the accumulated planned expenses for a project. The Earned Value (EV) is subtracted from the Actual Costs (AC) to calculate the cost variance. Meanwhile, the Schedule Variance (SV) compares the Earned Value (EV) and Planned Value (PV) against the project baseline and work schedule. It’s worth noting that EVM relies on monetary values instead of schedule indicators, which some professionals may find unreliable [32, 57]. This study focuses on examining the financial metrics utilized to manage project management profitability. However, the current version of the Earned Value Management (EVM) framework lacks complete oversight over production and revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an additional baseline to ensure better control over these aspects [26]. EBITDA and EVM can be integrated into project management for a positive outcome. The project manager can use EBITDA as a buffer to manage actual costs effectively. Based on Fig 5, the EBITDA figure is positive, which suggests that the revenue surpasses the costs incurred (EV-AC). In project management, cost variance is the difference between planned and actual costs, denoted as CV (PM) = planned costs—AC. Moreover, schedule variance (SV) is the difference between the work performed and the scheduled planned value (SV = EV—PV). We must integrate these metrics into each WBS and work package to include EBITDA and EBITDA Margin in the EVM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g005 Numerous companies encounter difficulties when implementing budgets [58]. The literature emphasizes that performance measurement is essential for effectively managing production systems [56]. Inaccurate data can hinder companies in assessing profitability and recognizing areas for improvement [54]. Financial indicators like EBITDA are important for demonstrating the process’s financial performance to management. Developing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as EBITDA would enable stakeholders to have visibility into the process’s real-time performance [59]. Monitoring real-time product costs is crucial for promptly identifying any unexpected increases that could erode the EBITDA margin [51]. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) serves as a framework for outlining the project budget [30, 60, 61]. EBITDA can be assigned to each WBS and Work Package using a top-down approach, establishing target EBITDA and refining these allocations based on bottom-up input. By combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, governance challenges can be addressed effectively, and learning within the project management process can be promoted. The allocation of EBITDA to every WBS provides a profitability indicator for each business process. Companies can apply Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to reduce activity costs by analyzing and redesigning WBS workflows and processes [62]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into the WBS facilitates the implementation of BPR in project management, ultimately strengthening profitability. In addition to the result of the study in section 2.4 we will further study to addresses the third research question RQ3. How can a company use integrated EVM-I/S to increase PM profitability and maximize PM daily EBITDA? To maximize daily EBITDA, project managers need to focus on improving cost efficiency, productivity, quality, delivery, and safety [13, 63, 64]. The first step is to provide structured indicators to assess whether a production system efficiently uses its resources [56]. Maximizing daily EBITDA involves conducting daily simulations [65], setting high expectations, utilizing objective data, and providing timely feedback on performance [66]. Strategies like Business Process (BP) methods [11], and the Project Value Risk Opportunity (PVRO) framework can help achieve high-performance positions and optimize decision-making [4, 67, 68]. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint through lean methods in business process management, which involves identifying customer value and addressing wastage to resolve bottlenecks. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint by increasing their capacity with extra resources [69]. Addressing wastage can resolve bottlenecks in the process, leading to improvements [59]. The superficial differences in Business Processes improvement may significantly impact project success [62]. In summary, we define the following hypotheses: This section answers the fourth research question: What benefits does using EBITDA to measure PM profitability offer? Through a literature review, we identified the limitations of EVM implementation [6], and how integrating EBITDA can mitigate these issues: It is crucial to integrate EBITDA into each Work Breakdown Structure as it enables a company to establish an internal control system for guiding resource allocation decisions based on WBS EBITDA or EBITDA Margin. These internal control systems are essential for managing companies with multi-operation production systems, particularly in the context of organizations overseeing multiple manufacturing facilities. The introduction of divisional and departmental budgets plays a key role in overseeing daily operations and comparing production and costs across different divisions and departments [65]. Integrating EBITDA into WBS, the company can differentiate the critical and non-critical activities in Project management. Project managers are required to work closely with other departments to effectively manage EBITDA and meet EBITDA targets. Coordination involves integrating a series of interdependent tasks that are essential for organizational productivity and efficiency [70–72]. Cooperation is vital for the successful implementation of complex strategies, relying on coordinated efforts and information sharing [71, 73]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into EVM will allow for better visualization of the interdependency among activities. Achieving target EBITDA requires improved cooperation, coordination, and interdependency among activities. Maximizing daily EBITDA hinges on improving behavior and engagement. Engagement refers to involvement, commitment, and the willingness to overcome obstacles or constraints in strategy execution, ultimately challenging these constraints and delivering better performance [70, 74–76]. Therefore, integration of EBITDA into WBS will simplify manager to manage profitability. Ensuring maximum daily EBITDA across all work breakdown structures and work packages requires effective communication. Precise and efficient communication is vital for sharing strategic information and facilitating successful implementation [72, 75, 77]. Thus, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will provide project managers with the necessary information. Therefore, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will enable the project manager’s ability to get the information needed. The above findings reveal that integrating EBITDA as a business process target and WBS enables project managers to improve daily profitability. The integration simplifies the project managers’ ability to demonstrate daily profitability (to avoid information asymmetry). In addition, the integration enables support project manager in achieving successful strategy and PM Target. Based on our findings, we formulated the following hypothesis: Building on the previous findings, we are now addressing research question 5: How can a company optimize its support for strategic PM decisions using EBITDA? Evaluating project success is challenging, as different stakeholders have varying definitions of success. To address this, it’s important to consider the perspectives of the owner, contractor, end user, and the public. While measuring management performance is crucial, financial results often lag behind decision-making, posing challenges for taking timely action [55]. To prevent delays in accessing profitability information, it is recommended to monitor daily EBITDA. By sharing profitability information and displaying planned and actual daily EBITDA, the company can promote transparency and enhance its capabilities in this area. This approach fosters effective communication, supports knowledge management, and reinforces the significance of project management [17, 20, 78]. The equitable distribution of information has a positive impact on both individual and organizational performance. Effective communication by project managers significantly enhances the performance of project teams, as managers dedicate considerable time to communicating with team members and key stakeholders [79]. Sharing information can facilitate manufacturing decisions while visualizing and communicating efficiency and productivity can assist in setting goals and driving performance improvement [80]. The use of EBITDA indicator in every WBS enables PM to indicate deviations and streamline our business processes. This method helps us visualize and evaluate capacity across all processes, synchronize operational capacity, and identify bottlenecks [81, 82]. It is essential to communicate clearly and effectively when sharing information about EBITDA results, including the target, strategy, and implementation. This clear communication is crucial for ensuring that everyone understands the information and can successfully execute the strategy [70, 72, 77]. By summarizing this discussion and those in the previous subsections, we developed the following hypotheses: comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. From the above study, we can summarize that integrating EVM—Income Statements -WBS—EBITDA can broaden the application of EVM in management and business fields. Further, we will provide a summary table to ease the test of the hypotheses in the next Section. To answer RQ1, we summarize the finding from previous study and hypothesis in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t001 Table 1 provides an overview of the research questions, corresponding hypotheses, planned data collection, and analysis for Batch #1 and #2. The second round of data collection and analysis will be carried out to assess the comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. In reference to the study discussed in Section 2, it was concluded that incorporating earned value management (EVM) into income statements has the potential to improve project management profitability and increase its significance in the business and management fields. This research is a step towards wider acceptance of EVM in these domains. Furthermore, we will delve into the hypotheses in the upcoming section. The authors have confirmed that this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (ethics committee) of the Bandung Institute of Technology prior to commencement. The original approval document was obtained from our academic institution’s ethics committee. The author and the author’s institution have obtained permission from the companies to conduct research for academic purposes and have been authorized to produce academic literature. The ethics statement document includes the written permit (approval) for research within the companies. The researcher/interviewer conducted the study without any prior relationship with the participants. Regarding participant consent, the author and the companies informed the participants that the study was purely for academic purposes. The research participants are company officials and management; no minors were included. The authors commenced research in Shipbuilding on May 15, 2023, and concluded it on July 12, 2024. Additionally, they initiated research in Aircraft Manufacturing on May 22, 2023, and completed it on July 19, 2024. To explore the connection between EVM and profitability, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Publish or Perish with the keyword "Earned Value Management." Initially, our search resulted in over 1000 articles. We then refined our search by adding the keyword "profit" and setting the publication date from 2014 onwards, which narrowed the relevant articles to 108. Using NVivo, we meticulously analyzed these articles to identify word frequencies. Our analysis revealed that "project = 15.754," "earned = 3.226," "EVM = 3.390," and "costs = 1.068" were frequently mentioned, while "revenue = 66," "profit = 300," and "profitability = 53" appeared less often. Overlooking these critical aspects could lead to information imbalances and conflicts among stakeholders, underscoring the necessity of integrating profitability into EVM for effective project management [78]. The table of this findings is available in S1 Appendix. Later in this chapter, our research indicates that EBITDA is the optimal profitability frontier for project management [67] and can serve as a suitable indicator for PM. By integrating EBITDA into EVM methodology, we can maximize daily EBITDA in every business process, WBS, and work package to enhance PM performance and profitability. Our research aims to create practical solutions through a pragmatic philosophy. Our methodology combined deduction and induction, and we developed a protocol to guide our research process [83]. We collected qualitative data through interviews and observation, while quantitative data was collected through online surveys. We employed a Multiple Embedded Case Study design. The selection was imperative to examine project complexity factors from an unbiased and comprehensive perspective [84]. Our analysis involved using SPSS for statistical analysis and NVivo for qualitative analysis. The Case Study Protocol and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research Checklist are available in S2 and S3 Appendices [83, 85]. The corresponding author conducted the interview or focus group. The author has 25 years of experience as a management consultant and is considered an expert in turnaround strategies. The participants know the interviewer as the company’s Turnaround Expert. The interviewers’ genuine interest in the research topic and enthusiasm about conducting a case study that combines long-term practical experience with theory is evident. The study focused on understanding profitability information asymmetry in Project Management using EVM systems. They are eager to share knowledge with academic and practical communities. The authors of this study delved into relevant theories and conducted surveys to comprehensively explore the effects of information asymmetry on profitability in Project Management, specifically through the use of EVM systems. They found that this information imbalance could potentially lead to conflicts between management and stakeholders. To gain a deeper understanding, the study employed both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, utilizing multiple embedded case studies and surveys. The research focused on Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to improve Project Management Performance and Profitability. Specifically, the study included two project-based organizations in the defense industry. The authors conducted detailed case studies on two companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their WBS. The first company, a prominent shipbuilding company, managed 25 projects, including warships and submarines, while the second company, an aircraft manufacturing company, oversaw 20 projects, including helicopters and rockets. The study included the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative research methods, such as interviews and purposive sampling, were utilized. Invitations were extended to 30 individuals from Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies, and 20 participants from various levels within the organizations were selected to take part. Regrettably, ten individuals were unable to participate due to time and scheduling constraints. Additional qualitative data was gathered through observations at aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies, as well as through meeting minutes from the corporate office. The research purpose was to communicate to the interviewees through various means, including face-to-face interviews, emails, WhatsApp messages, and phone calls. The company’s Board of Directors and employees were involved in the survey and interviews. The researcher obtained qualitative data from the corporate office through observations, interviews, and meeting minutes. During the interviews, only the interviewer and the interviewees were present. However, during observations and group discussions, non-participants who were company employees not assigned to the project were in the room. The researchers provided a question guide and survey questionnaires for the structured interviews. For the unstructured interviews, the interviewees freely expressed their opinions about the program. Repeat interviews with the same person were not conducted. Structured interviews involved asking the same standardized questions to different interviewees. Before recording, the author informed the interviewees that the interview would be recorded and obtained their consent. During the interviews, the author used audio-visual recording via Zoom to gather data, enabling the taking of meeting minutes during the session. Interviews and discussions typically lasted 30–60 minutes, and participants received transcripts for review. For Interviews, we sent thirty invitations to two companies, ten people unable to participate due to time and schedule constraints. As shown in Table 2, the author held two sessions of interviews with 20 volunteers representing various positions, including board members, senior executives, managers, project managers, and professionals from the PM team. The interview participants are as follows: one COO (Male, master’s degree); one CFO (Male, master’s degree); one EVP (Male, a master’s degree); nine V.P. (1 Male with a Doctorate, 1 Female with a master’s degree, 4 Males with a master’s degree, 3 Males with a bachelor’s degree); and eight Managers (1 Male with a master’s degree, 3 Females with bachelor’s degrees, 4 Males with bachelor’s degrees). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t002 The first session consisted of structured interviews with predetermined questions. We distributed research protocols before the questionnaires to ensure the validity and reliability of our study [83, 84]. In the second session, we conducted unstructured interviews to delve deeper into participants’ understanding of integrating EBITDA with EVM and its usefulness in project management for their company. We specifically focused on the benefits of measuring PM EBITDA for project managers and stakeholders [78]. We used a longitudinal time horizon to understand the development of business processes and cultural improvement over time, which is valuable for researchers and project managers [2]. The researcher identified the themes in advance, but the author did not discuss data saturation in this qualitative research. The author used NVivo software to analyze the qualitative data from the interviews. During the project/program briefing, the participants were provided feedback on the findings. In addition, we combined the case study with the survey method to create a comprehensive mixed-methods research design [83]. The author collected data from two separate participant batches from shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing companies for quantitative data. We conducted our survey in two batches, with 220 volunteer participants (104 Shipbuilding participants, and 116 Aircraft Manufacturing Participants) surveyed over six months to test Hypotheses. As shown in Table 3, during the second batch, we involved 125 volunteer participants (from both companies) over 11 months to test hypotheses A, B, C, and D. Our empirical data was collected using questionnaires scored on 7-point Likert scales and was quantitatively analyzed using SPSS. The researcher used the participants’ quotations to explain the findings from the interview results. The participants conveyed their perspectives using standard daily language, adding depth and authenticity to the research. This use of daily language made the findings more transparent and more relatable by showcasing how they were grounded in the participants’ actual words. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t003 Referring to section 2.1.3, Fig 2 shows the integration of the income statement’s structure, EVM, and its relationship with management control. Our research findings from section 2 indicate that companies can integrate EVM into overall business management by aligning it with income statement metrics. We propose expanding the use of EVM beyond project management. Project managers can incorporate EBITDA into every WBS to facilitate the direct translation of EVM indicators into financial reporting language and establish a relevant profitability metric for project management. To validate these conclusions, we comprehensively analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to address all remaining research questions. In our initial data collection, we analyzed 220 questionnaires using IBM-SPSS to examine the use of EBITDA in project management profitability. We also investigated how a company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system and the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability. This analysis used the following abbreviations: AMC means aircraft manufacturing corporation and SBC means shipbuilding corporation. Supporting Information for the First Batch of data analysis is available in S4 Appendix. Proportion Testing Hypothesis Research Question 2: Is EBITDA the proper measure for project management profitability? Hypothesis 1.A: EBITDA is the proper measure of Project Management Profitability because it excludes Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization, which do not vary due to Project Management efficiency and productivity variation. Hypothesis 1. B: EBITDA is the proper measure of project management profitability because it is entirely under the control of the project manager and team. Research Question 3: How can a company maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system? The Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA with EVM and applying target EBITDA margins in every work breakdown structure and work package. Hypothesis 2.A: The Company can maximize EBITDA with EVM in Project Management by integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying target EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. Research Question 4: What are the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability? Hypotheses 3.A: Using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows Project Managers and Teams to manage and maximize Project Management Profitability actively. Hypothesis 3.B Applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily Research Question 5 How can a company improve its ability to support and make strategic decisions for Project Management using EBITDA? Hypotheses 4.A: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA result with its supporting Units. Hypothesis 4.B: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA with the Board of Directors to provide timely strategic decisions to Project management Chi square Testing This analysis technique belongs to non-parametric statistics, which is a branch of statistics that does not rely on the assumption of a particular distribution of the data. It is often used when the data does not meet the assumption of normality or when the sample size is small. This method is more flexible and can be applied to ordinal data or data that is not measured at intervals. Hypothesis H01: π ≤ 0.70 Ha1: π > 0.70 The test statistics used in the population proportion test Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if χ2>χ2 table with α = 0.05 Table 4 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t004 The First Batch Hypothesis testing results are shown in Table 4. 1. While testing hypothesis 1.A, both AMC and SBC agree that EBITDA is a suitable measure of Project Management Profitability. 2. In evaluating hypothesis 1.B, there is a divergence of opinions between AMC and SBC regarding the control of EBITDA Project Management, with SBC disagreeing with the statement (χ2- value < 3.481 and p-value>0.05). 3. When testing hypothesis 2.A, there are differing opinions on whether integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying the target EBITDA Margin in WBS and Work Package can maximize EBITDA in EVM. Less than 70% of SBC respondents disagreed with the statement (χ2- value < 3.481 and p value> 0.05). 4. Hypothesis 3.A. testing indicates that using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows for active management and maximization of profitability, with approval from most AMC and SBC respondents (more than 70%, with χ2- value > 3.481 and -value < 0.05). 5. Hypothesis 3.B testing reveals a key insight: applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS empowers companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily. While SBC respondents may have disagreed (χ2- value < 3.481 and p-value >0.05), the practical implications of this finding are significant, providing a clear path to enhanced profitability management. 6. In testing hypotheses 4.A and 4.B, a unanimous approval was received from all AMC and SBC respondents. This finding underscores the Company’s potential to enhance its ability to support Project management by sharing daily Targets and Actual EBITDA results with the Company’s supporting Units and the Board of Directors, instilling confidence in the proposed strategies. After implementing Maximizing Daily EBITDA in Aircraft Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Companies for eleven months, we conducted the second round of data collection. We gathered responses from 125 questionnaires without differentiating between aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies. We tested several EBITDA and operational profitability hypotheses using a test statistic, χ2. The results of the testing are summarized below. Supporting Information for the Second Batch of data analysis is available in S5 Appendix. Our commitment to a comprehensive analysis led us to conduct proportion testing on the data, testing a multitude of hypotheses. This rigorous process is a testament to our dedication to providing the most accurate and insightful findings. H01) π ≤ 0.70 and Ha1) π > 0.70. The test statistic used is Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if χ2>χ2 table with α = 0.05 The results are summarized in Table 5 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t005 Proportion Testing Hypothesis H01: π ≤ 0.70 Ha1: π > 0.70 The test statistics used in Chi square test are , x is people who answered 6 or 7 on the question E = n.po and po = 0.70 decision making: Reject Ho if p-value < α (= 0.05) Sumary sub section 4.1.2: Table 6 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t006 All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were greater than 0.70 (70%) with a small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompasses both structured and unstructured interviews. After completing a comprehensive qualitative data analysis, it has become evident that EBITDA is the most suitable operating profit indicator for the EVM system in Project Management. Integrating EBITDA into EVM involves establishing the budget’s EBITDA value to determine plan costs and applying the EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. By using EBITDA to evaluate project management profitability, the company can empower the project manager and team to understand the target EBITDA and maximize profitability. Sharing EBITDA can also enhance support and facilitate timely strategic decisions for Project Management. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo, as depicted in Table 4, showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompass both structured and unstructured interviews. Discussion of qualitative analysis with NVivo Table 7 and Fig A-3 until A-6 in S1 Appendix display the results of the qualitative analysis using structured interviews by NVivo. Supporting Information of the interview is available in S6 Appendix. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t007 Referring to the Quantitative and Qualitative data results, we found that some employees needed to be aware of the importance of EBITDA for Project Management during the early assessment. Regarding H2, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that EBITDA project management is entirely under the control of the project manager and the team. This response is because some operational and project management personnel remained unaware of the EBITDA concept. Many of them were not concerned with controlling EBITDA. The Interview with the chief financial and human capital officer (Interviewee O) confirmed this result. Regarding H3, less than 70% of SBC respondents agreed that a company can maximize EBITDA in EVM by integrating EBITDA into WBS and applying the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package. This response is because some people in the SBC did not have experience implementing the EBITDA–EVM integration. The SBC was in the early stage of implementing EBITDA–EVM integration using its information technology system, the ITS. The senior vice president of corporate transformation (Interviewee D) confirmed this explanation in the Interview. Regarding H5, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control project management profitability daily. This response is because some SBC employees need experience managing daily Profitability. However, the management expected the situation to change because the Company has begun implementing daily control and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system, supported by their information system, ITS. The vice president of human capital (Interviewee M) confirmed this explanation and explained the Company’s policy to control employees’ daily activities using handphone devices provided by the Company. After eleven months of maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management, we found significant improvement in understanding the concept from the survey of both companies. Regarding the first research question, we found that the respondents agree that EBITDA is appropriate for project management profitability. Fig 2 displays the integration of EVM into the Income Statement using seven earnings steps. Fig 3 shows EBITDA under the control of Operation Management and Project Management. On the other hand, Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax are not under the control of Operation Management but of the Board of Directors. Regarding the second research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Regarding the third Research Question, we found that the respondents agree that the Company can get the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability from Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that will ease Operational Management and Project Management to display their Profitability every day. Regarding the fourth research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company improved its ability to support and make strategic decisions for project management using EBITDA from the availability of daily EBITDA information for divisions and company operational units, as well as project management to provide support for achieving successful strategy and project management. All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were more significant than 0.70 (70%) with a relatively small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values ​​calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. Based on our assessment, some employees need to understand the significance of EBITDA for project management. Less than 70% of the SBC respondents initially agreed to incorporate EBITDA into WBS and apply the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package to optimize EVM. The SBC is still in the early stages of integrating EBITDA and EVM using its information technology system, the ITS. Significant improvements were observed after nearly a year of focusing on integrating EVM into income statements and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management. The respondents concur that EBITDA is the appropriate measure for project management profitability. The consensus among respondents was that the company could enhance daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures (WBS). Concerning management practices, when proposing a program like integrating EVM into an income statement in project management, managers consider the expected costs of adoption against the expected benefits. The new system’s speed and ease of adoption will depend on corporate and national cultures [86]. It is strategically advantageous to incorporate EBITDA into every Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Package. This integration allows the management team to effectively oversee job assignments. When combined with Earned Value Management (EVM), this approach can significantly enhance profitability by improving efficiency and productivity. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS aligns project management and financial systems. This common language enables leaders to cultivate a robust corporate culture, enhance efficiency, and improve productivity for superior performance and profitability. By comparing EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends before and during project management execution, organizations can make informed decisions about resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio. Despite the importance and widespread nature of projects, there is currently little space devoted to project management research in leading business and management journals. We need more research for systemic approaches to projects, situating them in broader organizational landscapes. Addressing grand challenges involves changing project management practices to create and distribute value among diverse stakeholders [3]. The principles of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are accessible to all project management professionals and can be applied across various business and management domains. It is hoped that professionals in fields other than project management will adopt these concepts. This study demonstrates that incorporating EVM into income statements can enhance project management profitability, reduce information asymmetry, and garner support from stakeholders for making strategic decisions to ensure project management success. Specifically, this integration allows project managers to optimize Daily EBITDA within each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and achieve improved performance and profitability. Integrating EVM into the income statement was challenging and required a shift in organizational culture. However, after eleven months of focusing on maximizing daily EBITDA within the EVM system, there was a notable improvement in understanding the concept based on the survey responses from participating companies. The study also highlights that EBITDA is a suitable metric for assessing project management profitability, as it is within the control of Operations Management and Project Management. Conversely, factors such as depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes fall under the purview of the board of directors rather than operations management. Furthermore, by incorporating EBITDA as a target within each WBS, companies can effectively maximize daily EBITDA in project management within the EVM system, providing a clear view of profitability daily. This integration will facilitate communication between project management professionals and business management and foster greater acceptance of project management concepts within the business and management fields. Hopefully, this will also encourage dialogue between project management scholars and those in related disciplines, particularly business and management. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The Organization can improve its decision-making regarding resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio by conducting a thorough comparison of EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends both before and during project management execution. This study provides valuable insights and evidence-based ideas about project management and can potentially enhance its use in the business and management sectors. The author’s unique contribution lies in integrating EVM into the income statement with EBITDA into WBS. This research ensures we can apply the theoretical concepts effectively in practical settings with broader implications. The implications of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are understandable to any project management professional and can be applied across various business and management sectors. It is hoped that professionals in fields beyond project management will embrace these concepts. These topics warrant further in-depth exploration in future research. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s005 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s006 (DOCX)

Title: Is AI A Boom, Bubble, Or Con? Here’s What The Evidence Suggests

Robot and young woman face to face. Everyone knows that the stock market’s super-run in recent years has revolved around seven core stocks: The “Magnificent Seven” of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (in alphabetical order). Most of the seven, if not all, are assumed to be the beneficiaries of the stupendous growth of artificial intelligence. The “Magnificent Seven” have a combined market value of more than $17 trillion, and accounted for over half of the S&P 500’s total return in 2024. Over the last five years, all seven have seen annualized appreciation rates of 20 percent or more, with Tesla hitting 73 percent and Nvidia exceeding 90 percent. Is this sustainable? How does it all end? And what does it say about the AI boom that plays a pivotal role in the seven’s success? Two years ago, I published a Forbes column about Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, and the bitcoin mania. Back then, the price of a single bitcoin hovered around $20,000, while it hovers around $100,000 today. Then, like now, a key question was being asked: Is bitcoin a boom, a bubble, or a “con”? The Wall Street Journal’s Vicky Ge Huang recently compiled the warnings that some of the world’s great investors gave the public about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and yet the $100,000 valuation suggests we’re not listening. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a useless “pet rock,” while Citadel CEO Ken Griffin wonders aloud, “What problem does it solve for our economy?” But what about AI? Is artificial intelligence something that the truly sophisticated suspect to be another bubble, and we’re ignoring that risk? Or is AI an actual boom, and the question is how and when the “landing” comes? My conclusion is the latter. AI is a real investment in something that even less experienced investors can understand where big-league returns may arise. From medical applications to breakthroughs in content creation or computer science, AI is already revolutionizing the world of work, and there’s no reason for the innovation to stop now. And yet, will the returns be big enough or likely enough to warrant the kind of investment it now takes to “get in the game”? That’s where I get more skeptical. There is a long list of things that have to go right for the value creation of the magnitude assumed by today’s AI pricings to materialize: One thing is clear: AI is a very real and transformative technology, but scale will be integral to addressing such problems. The market will only want—and can only afford—four or five surviving players. As product competition leads to commoditization, competitive pricing and the ability to “stay current” will be the keys to survival. As always, a select few investors will make enormous sums of money either by riding the wave and getting out of the water in time, or picking one of the ultimate survivors and hanging on for the ride. Countless start-ups and venture capital firms will see 100 percent losses as they stall out on scale or fall outside the cone of competitive capability. However, all of the evidence suggests AI is neither a bubble nor a con; it is a boom with lasting potential. While there is plenty of irrational exuberance related to AI, that is the free market’s way of experimenting and learning, which have always given the U.S. economy its edge. AI’s biggest winners will have solutions that address real problems and create new forms of competitive advantage, and we should be ready for those benefits to materialize in the coming years. On the other hand, hindsight will become 20-20 for the losers who assumed it was a “sure thing.” When only a few numbers will come up winners, I don’t see anyone winning by placing bets across the board. AI will be a long-term winner for a select—and potentially magnificent—few who successfully sell their wares with scale to customers who happily pay for the cost and productivity gains they will create.

Title: Is SelectQuote, Inc. (SLQT) Among the Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025. An insurance agent with a tablet device accessing a technology-enabled platform. To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $3.72 5-Year Sales Growth: 34.42% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13 SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) is an insurance and healthcare services company. The company uses technology to connect consumers directly with insurance products, allowing them to compare options from multiple providers easily. It operates through a series of business lines including SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Healthcare Services, SelectQuote Life, and SelectQuote Auto and Home. The company has implemented highly targeted lead-sourcing strategies for policy origination, which have proven effective during the Annual Enrollment Period (AEP). This approach is critical as SelectQuote aims to optimize cash flow and improve its balance sheet. Moreover, it is also leveraging AI tools to enhance operational efficiency by screening and prioritizing calls, thus simplifying processes behind the scenes. These effective marketing strategies resulted in a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue, totaling $292.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up from $232.7 million in the same period last year. In addition to revenue, the company also improved its adjusted EBITDA by reducing the loss by nearly $10 million, from negative $11.4 million last year to negative $1.7 million during the current fiscal year. On the bright side, its healthcare segment saw membership grow by 64%, reaching over 86,000 members. This segment has now recorded six consecutive quarters of profitability, demonstrating strong operational execution. Management anticipates continued success driven by its strategic initiatives in both Senior distribution and Healthcare Services. Overall, SLQT ranks 7th on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of SLQT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLQT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) on The Net Worth Club’s Substack by Danny Brody. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TTWO. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)'s share was trading at $183.07 as of Jan 2nd. TTWO’s forward P/E was 23.87 according to Yahoo Finance. A computer technician working on a video game console with a gaming headset. Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), the company behind hit franchises like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and NBA 2K, is positioning itself as a prime player in the gaming industry despite facing a recent net loss of $1.125 billion, largely attributed to write-downs and impairment charges. For fiscal 2024, Take-Two reported $5.35 billion in revenue, placing it among the industry's elite. While its profitability has been affected by one-time events, the recurring revenue from its core franchises offers a strong foundation for future growth. This resilience and the potential for a turnaround make TTWO an appealing investment, especially for those looking beyond short-term setbacks. The gaming industry is experiencing significant consolidation, and TTWO stands out as an attractive acquisition target, especially as tech giants like Microsoft continue to strengthen their positions by acquiring major content providers. Amazon’s rumored interest in gaming via acquisition further underscores TTWO’s potential. With a market cap of $32 billion, Take-Two is still smaller than Activision Blizzard, which was acquired by Microsoft for $75 billion, making it an affordable target relative to its intrinsic value. Take-Two's shift toward recurring revenue models, such as subscription services, in-game purchases, and free-to-play models, aligns with broader industry trends. The upcoming release of highly anticipated titles like Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to drive significant revenue growth. The release of GTA 6, following the success of GTA 5, could generate more than $10 billion in revenue for Take-Two, cementing its position as a leader in the gaming industry. If TTWO were valued similarly to Activision, applying an 8.5x revenue multiple would push its valuation to $45.5 billion, or about $256 per share—substantially higher than its current market price. With its strong intellectual property, expanding revenue models, and exciting pipeline, Take-Two is well-positioned for both short-term gains and long-term growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity in the evolving gaming landscape. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 46 hedge fund portfolios held TTWO at the end of the third quarter which was 48 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of TTWO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TTWO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Morning After: FCC’s attempt to restore net neutrality didn't work
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=175822317
Time Published: 2025-01-03T12:32:06Z

The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the FCC does not have the "statutory authority" to implement net neutrality rules. Since the rules were established in 2015, the FCC argued that classifying ISPs as "telecommunication services" gives it broad authority to regulate them. The decision to redefine ISPs as "information services" during the first Trump Administration led to the repeal of net neutrality in 2017. The current FCC voted to restore net neutrality on April 25 last year. The difference between 2015 and now is the Supreme Court's recent, radical reinterpretation of an important legal doctrine. The Chevron doctrine said that if Congress doesn't weigh in on an issue, courts are supposed to defer to the interpretation of government agencies. Now, interpretation falls to the individual judge, and the Sixth Court doesn't agree with the FCC. This is the end of the road for the FCC’s attempts to wrench a little bit of the power from internet providers and carriers and level speeds and access regardless of service.

East Village Bar in Douglas Long-standing Douglas pub East Village has said it is "time to say goodbye" after operating in the town for more than two decades. The bar is set to be transferred to new ownership and will close from Monday, January 6 to facilitate a "smooth transition" for the new owners. In a post shared on its social media, the bar said it will also be hosting a farewell party to celebrate the last 20 years in business. "All of us here at East Village would like to thank all of our wonderful customers and staff, friends and family, for joining us over the years," the social media post read. "There’s been many laughs and unforgettable memories the last 20 years but we are sad to announce it’s time to say goodbye. "We hope you can join us this Saturday for our farewell party and celebrate the East Village with us." The East Village's current owners are well-known publicans Jon Cronin and Derry O'Regan. Speaking to the Irish Examiner, Mr O'Regan said the business is being transferred to new owners who have "big plans" to renovate and relaunch. "As we are in limbo legal period, we can't disclose too much until January 21, 2025." A post shared by Irish Examiner (@irish_examiner) "But as we say goodbye and thank you to all our customers and staff, we look forward to visiting the rejuvenated East Village in a few months," Mr O'Regan added. The owners' portfolio also comprises Tequila Jacks on Lapp's Quay and Paddy the Farmers on Old Blackrock Road. Paddy the Farmers opened in 2015 and Tequila Jack’s in 2017. The businessmen also owned Soho on Grand Parade which traded for 17 years before changing hands. The venue now trades as Seventy Seven and was said to have cost as much as €5m when reported at the time. more irish examiner instagram articles More in this section News and analysis on business, money and jobs from Munster and beyond by our expert team of business writers.

Title: Secret Level asked Microsoft about an awesome Halo and Doom crossover — "Crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood," but Microsoft said: "Nah."
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/secret-level-halo-doom-crossover-microsoft-said-no
Time Published: 2025-01-03T11:14:37Z

An interview with the creators of Secret Level revealed how crossover episode pitches to id Software and Microsoft fell flat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I still remember when I first heard about Xbox making a Halo TV show. I'm not reminiscing about when the Paramount TV show was announced, but when they first mentioned that Steven Spielberg would be directing it in 2013. An entire decade before. It was around the time of the Xbox One announcement and launch. The Halo TV show was part of the whole "all your entertainment in a single box" push. It was meant to usher in a new age at Microsoft, one that focused on programming and content for the customer. After years of hearing, "Don't worry, the Halo show is still coming," we were finally blinded by Master Cheeks. Halo fans around the globe held their gaming controllers, hoping for a cinematic Master Piece. What they received was a show that not only missed the spirit of the franchise but somehow failed to even make a decent sci-fi series.Once I heard the helmet was coming off, it was like I heard the sounds of distant Plasma Grenades echoing across the city. Lore was ignored or replaced, and we ended up with a weird romance being pitched between Master Chief and someone who wasn't Cortana. It's one of the easiest things to get right. I guess that's what made the following news all the more confusing to me. In an interview with Collider, Tim Miller and Dave Wilson, the men behind the new TV show Secret Level, revealed a few interesting tidbits that definitely caused some sore necks from the massive head turn we all did. For those unaware, Secret Level is an animated anthology series that covers the worlds of 15 different video games. Led in production by Blur Studios and Amazon MGM Studios, the series saw Pac-Man, Warhammer, Sifu, and more make the cut in the first season. It's what didn't show up that people found rather baffling. When asked whether the showrunners went after certain games, Tim Miller responded with, "I get a little chafed when I read online, and they're like, 'Hold on, these assholes took Spelunky when they could have taken Halo?' Or something like that. I'm like, 'Man, you think that we didn't talk to Halo or something?'" Dave Wilson continued later, "The creative director at ID [Software] is a good friend of ours, and so are folks at Microsoft, so we made a big plea because one of the things both Tim and I would love to do is do something that isn't currently available in the games, like crossovers. We wanted to make a Master Chief/Doom Slayer crossover episode, and I spent a whole weekend crafting this impassioned letter of my childhood. And it's exactly what Tim said; they were like, 'Nah.'" Excuse me? Microsoft said what? You had showrunners who were absolutely enthralled with the world of Halo and Doom and wanted to make something extraordinary, and you said no? Not to mention, with Blur Studios leading development, a studio that has already worked on multiple Halo games, you could have had the easiest Stick of your life. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Okay, I get it. You just released your Halo show you've been grinding to get done for almost a decade, and it bombed to the point of cancellation. Maybe you're a little Battle Rifle shy at the moment, but would it really have been any worse than what we got? Off the heels of the Halo TV show and layoffs at 343 Industries, Halo desperately needs a W. Even if a potential Halo and Doom crossover episode finds mixed reviews, it would already be infinitely better than what Paramount produced, but maybe that's the issue. Can Microsoft allow someone else to make a Halo TV show at the moment? After Paramounts failure, a successful spinoff like Secret Level could ruin the relationship between the two companies. While Halo failed, Microsoft has found success with Amazon and its award-winning take on Fallout. Netflix is also currently working on multiple Gears of War projects; there are plenty of IPs Microsoft has yet to explore. It's never a good idea to burn any bridges with a potential future partner on a project down the road. Even though Master Sheets didn't do so well with audiences, that doesn't mean Paramount is empty of video game-adapting talent. You only need to look at Sonic's success to see that (Don't look at the early trailers). Respect the source material, and it's pretty damn easy to find success. Gamers aren't a mystery. Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over sillier things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise that was worldly beloved? Had Microsoft said yes, maybe Paramount would have seen that as an action by Microsoft that admits the TV series they distributed was awful. It sounds silly, but I've seen companies halt production over more childish things before. Remember when Disney and Sony almost completely canceled the Spider-Man franchise, which was a box-office record-setter? At the end of the day, the fans of the series still deserve better. How freaking awesome would it be to see the Doom Slayer and Master Chief ripping apart flood-infested demons to save the human race? You could do it with minimal dialogue, too, where Chief calls out, "I need a weapon," and Doomguy tosses him a BFG with a nod. This writes itself, people! After slaying the demon race and protecting humanity once more, Chief reports back to base for a briefing, and Doomguy goes into cryo while stealing Chief's line, "Wake me when you need me." I didn't even realize how sad this whole thing was until I started writing this fanfic. Is it too late to petition Microsoft to say yes for the second season? At least the Halo Infinite storyline is pretty decent. What do you think? Let us know below or on social media. I'll be checking out the replies and conversing with anyone that wants to. If you're like me, you'll also daydream up some astonishing moments with cliche dialogue that seels the entire thing.

Frax intends to be the US digital dollar and to establish itself as "the world's most innovative decentralised stablecoin and DeFi stablecoin infrastructure." 0 03 January 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Decentralised stablecoin cryptocurrency protocol Frax Finance has launched a new stablecoin, frxUSD, that will leverage BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and will be tokenised by Securitize. Securitize will drive the compliant digitisation of financial assets through blockchain technology. Securitize, or through its subsidiaries, is also a registered broker-dealer and operates a primary marketplace, an alternative trading system, as well as a transfer agent and has an exempt reporting adviser. The frxUSD stablecoin, a rebrand of Frax's FRAX stablecoin, will offer direct fiat redemption capabilities and enhanced compliance with US financial systems. BUIDL will also become an enshrined custodian asset for minting and redeeming frxUSD. This means that the stablecoin will be uniquely backed by assets held in BlackRock's BUIDL, which invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. This bolsters transparency and on-chain audibility, solidifying frxUSD as the first stablecoin to offer seamless fiat on/off-ramping capabilities via Blackrock's BUIDL infrastructure. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, says: "Tokenized real-world assets provide an excellent bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing institutional-grade investments on-chain with unprecedented transparency and efficiency. This collaboration exemplifies the next stage in financial evolution, demonstrating how traditional and decentralized systems can work together to redefine asset management strategies. The integration of frxUSD and the BUIDL fund is a clear signal of the transformative potential of tokenization in modern finance." Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, adds: "By partnering with Securitize to access and leverage BlackRock's BUIDL Fund we are setting a new standard for stablecoins. frxUSD combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology with the trust and stability of BlackRock's prime treasury offerings. This collaboration is a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems."

Title: Nvidia Stock Vs. Custom AI Chips: Should Investors Worry?

Signage with logo at the Silicon Valley headquarters of computer graphics hardware company Nvidia, ... [+] Santa Clara, California, August 17, 2017. (Photo via Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Nvidia stock had a stellar 2024, rising by almost 3x to about $135 per share. Business has boomed led by the surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) which have emerged as the backbone of the generative artificial intelligence era. That said, over the last month or so investors appear to have their eyes on another sector of the semiconductor market, namely ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that could play a bigger role in AI computing. This comes after two major ASIC players, Broadcom and Marvell Technology, reported a surge in demand for their ASICs from large cloud customers in the most recent quarters. Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? For instance, Broadcom’s sales from its custom AI chips and networking processors surged by 220% to $12.2 billion in 2024, up from $3.8 billion in revenue that the company generated from AI silicon in FY’23. To be sure, Nvidia’s sales are head and shoulders above, estimated to come in at about $129 billion this fiscal year, but its growth rates are slowing. So could ASICs threaten Nvidia’s AI dominance as the market matures? Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. ASICS vs GPUs ASICs have been around for more than five decades. However, they are seeing renewed interest in the AI era. While GPUs from companies such as Nvidia are pretty versatile and can be programmed for AI as well as other tasks, ASICs are custom-designed semiconductors built to perform specific tasks giving them certain advantages versus general processors. By focusing on targeted functionalities these chips offer several advantages versus GPUs for AI. For instance, these specialized chips could be more cost-effective than GPUs, which are designed for a wider range of applications. ASICs also consume less electricity and this makes them ideal for data centers aiming to reduce electricity costs - a key cost of operating large AI systems. ASICs can also achieve higher performance for dedicated tasks than general-purpose GPUs from Nvidia or AMD as they are purpose-built. These chips could be well suited for large cloud computing providers given that they operate at a scale that can justify the design and development costs of ASICs. For instance, Broadcom, a company that is viewed as the biggest beneficiary of a potential pivot toward ASICs, recently said that three of its hyperscaler customers intend to build clusters of 1 million custom chips across a single network. Change In The AI Space Benefits ASICs Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the significantly front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments just yet. See How Nvidia Stock Could Fall To $65. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see more customers looking toward ASICs to reduce upfront costs as well as operating costs. The longer-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. ASIC chips customized for inference could also be a top choice for these tasks. There is some historical precedent to this as well. For example, in the the crypto industry, Bitcoin miners initially used GPUs for mining, but some large players have since switched to ASICs as they scaled up given their better hash rates (effectively how many guesses the system makes per second to solve the crypto puzzle) and overall cost-effectiveness. What This Means For Nvidia While NVDA stock has seen strong growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four years; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what lies ahead for Nvidia stock? To be sure, we don’t expect Nvidia’s business to be supplanted by these new waves of processors, given the company’s head start in the AI market and its deeply entrenched CUDA software stack and development tools which results in high switching costs for customers. Moreover, if the market sees a strong shift, Nvidia too could potentially expand its presence in the space. However, Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully account for the potential risks and slowing growth. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, about 32% below the current market price.

Title: Happy Birthday, Bitcoin! The top cryptocurrency is old enough to drive
URL: https://qz.com/bitcoin-birthday-16-genesis-satoshi-nakamoto-1851731540
Time Published: 2025-01-03T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin is now 16 years old! Satoshi Nakamoto, a name used by the creator (or creators) of Bitcoin, mined the first Bitcoin block on Jan. 3, 2009. This “genesis” block followed the release of a Bitcoin whitepaper on October 31, 2008, which laid the foundation for the now-leading cryptocurrency. 2024 proved to be a landmark year for Bitcoin, culminating in an all-time high of $108,135 in December. Hypothetically, had someone invested $1,000 in Bitcoin on January 3, 2024, they would have witnessed a 115% growth in their investment, and seen it rise to $2,150. Over the past 16 years, Bitcoin has grown from a novel idea into a global phenomenon, shaping the cryptocurrency market and disrupting financial systems worldwide. From its humble beginnings in 2009, to its climb to $1 in 2011, and to its momentary rise above $100,000 in 2024, the journey so far reflects Bitcoin’s disruptive power. Let’s dive deeper into Bitcoin’s journey and see how it came to be a mainstream asset. Bitcoin rocketed in popularity after COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2021, it gained acceptance in mainstream finance with endorsements from influential figures. One of the pivotal moments was its inclusion in 401(k) plans, which marked a significant shift in how traditional retirement savings strategies embraced digital assets. After a prolonged bear market connected to the FTX collapse in 2022, Bitcoin made a strong comeback in 2024. Early on in the year, Bitcoin reached a high of $73,000 due to the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by the U.K.’s approval of Bitcoin-linked securities being listed on the stock market. In a year alone, the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a noteworthy achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Adding to the 2021 momentum, high-profile endorsements from business leaders, including Tesla (TSLA+8.10%) CEO Elon Musk, played a crucial role in amplifying Bitcoin’s appeal. In 2021, Tesla spent $1.5 billion on the cryptocurrency. Other publicly traded companies also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As of Dec. 30, 2024, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy owns the most at 446,400 Bitcoin. The entry of financial giants including BlackRock and Fidelity into the crypto world has bolstered the proposition that cryptocurrency could be the future of finance. Financial institutions are working on the tokenization of funds, and they seem to no longer see blockchain as a threat but rather as a tool.

Title: AI takes over CES 2025, one smart gadget at a time

Just when you thought your toaster couldn’t get any smarter, CES 2025 is about to prove you wrong. The world’s biggest tech show returns to Las Vegas from January 7-10, promising to stuff artificial intelligence into literally everything that has a power button. The AI gold rush remains in full swing: Samsung’s going all-in with its “AI for All: Everyday, Everywhere” vision — including AI fridges that promise to anticipate temperature changes when you’re unloading groceries — because apparently your lettuce needed a smart assistant. LG is getting oddly personal with what they’re calling “Affectionate Intelligence” (yes, really). Even Samsung’s startup incubator is showing off AI everything – from video production to exercise coaching to energy management. The message is clear: if your gadget doesn’t have AI in 2025, does it even exist? But this year’s real battleground is AI agents. After 2024's mixed bag of AI companions (pour one out for the Humane Pin and the half-baked Rabbit R1), tech giants are betting that what we really want is AI assistants baked into everything we own. The pitch for these empowered AI bots is that you won’t have to open apps for every little task; this tech promises to handle everything from scheduling your day to ordering your coffee, all through natural conversation. Whether they’ll actually deliver this time – or show any actual affection – remains to be seen. And yes, somehow, the TV industry has found its next revolution: a fancier cable. While the exact specs of HDMI 2.2 are still under wraps, it promises to surpass the impressive 10K resolution and 120Hz refresh rates of HDMI 2.1. Translation: Your movies and games are about to get even prettier, smoother, and more detailed — if you can find any 10K content to actually watch. On the computing front, Nvidia (NVDA+4.42%) CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage for what promises to be another leather-jacketed keynote about next-gen GPUs. Industry leaks suggest the RTX 5090 could be up to 70% faster than its predecessor, which already had “unholy power,” according to one reviewer. Not to be outdone, Intel and AMD are also expected to announce chips that will make your current gaming rig feel like a calculator. Speaking of chips, 2025 is shaping up to be the year PC makers try to convince you that your computer isn’t smart enough. After 2024's first wave of AI PCs with Copilot+ buttons and 16GB RAM requirements, Microsoft’s (MSFT+0.88%) next generation promises even more powerful NPUs and AI features. Dell, HP, and friends are hoping you’ll upgrade your Windows 10 machine (which loses support next year) to a shiny new AI-powered PC. Just don’t expect an immediate productivity boost – studies show current AI PC owners actually spend more time figuring out how to talk to their computers than getting actual work done. But hey, at least you’ll feel fancy while your PC makes you feel technologically illiterate. The auto industry continues its transformation into a tech show within a tech show. Hyundai’s Mobis division is set to steal some spotlight with what they’re calling the world’s first full-windshield holographic display. This isn’t just a fancy heads-up display, it’s a screen that spans from driver to passenger, promising to overlay navigation, vehicle info, and safety alerts across your entire field of view. Think Iron Man’s helmet display, but for your car. BMW’s not far behind, planning to debut their own take with something called the Panoramic iDrive display. About 100,000 tech enthusiasts, industry professionals, and AI chatbots (kidding — that would make it more like 200,000) will descend upon the Las Vegas Convention Center and Venetian Expo for the event. As always, CES promises to show us the future, or at least what tech companies think we’ll buy in the near future. Whether all these innovations actually make it to market in 2025 is another story entirely, but hey, that’s half the fun of CES.

Crypto market begins year with $310 million outflows from Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs. The first trading day of the year saw notable outflows from spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaling over $310 million. On Jan. 2, data from SoSoValue revealed that Bitcoin-focused ETFs experienced $242.3 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF, recorded its highest outflow since its inception, losing $332 million—or more than 3,500 BTC. This figure surpasses the previous record of $188 million set during the holiday season last year. The latest outflow marks IBIT’s third consecutive trading day of losses, amounting to $392.6 million in the past week. Despite these challenges, IBIT remains the leading spot Bitcoin ETF, with total net inflows of $36.9 billion and assets under management nearing $53.5 billion. While IBIT struggled, competitors showed resilience. Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark 21Shares’s ARKB reported inflows of $48.3 million, $36.2 million, and $16.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin products recorded divergent fates on the day. Per the data, the firm’s smaller Bitcoin Mini Trust attracted $6.9 million in fresh capital, though its flagship GBTC fund saw outflows of $23.1 million. As of Jan. 2, spot Bitcoin ETFs have a cumulative flow of $35 billion and hold $109 billion in assets. Ethereum ETFs also faced challenges, recording a combined outflow of $77.5 million. Bitwise’s ETHW fund led these losses with $56.1 million withdrawn, while Grayscale’s ETHE product followed, shedding $21.4 million. Other Ethereum-linked ETFs, including BlackRock’s ETHA, reported no changes in fund flows for the day. Ethereum-focused ETFs held a combined total of $2.58 billion in net inflows, with $12.4 billion in assets. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Kiwi sharemarket falls in first day of trading for 2025 - market close

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Shares in Sylvia Park mall owner Kiwi Property Group rose after BlackRock reduced its stake. Photo / NZ Herald The New Zealand sharemarket had a weak start to the year with the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 falling in light trading. The index closed down 0.33% at 13,067.83, a drop of 42.91 points on trading of 21.78 million shares worth $93.47 million. There were 52 decliners and 90 gainers on the main board. Shane Solly, portfolio manager with Harbour Asset Management, said the market was weak after a slightly weaker United States market overnight. “The volume isn’t very high and so the difference between today and the last day of last year is more ups than downs today, and so we’ve seen a bit of reversion.” Solly said some of the stocks that had a strong 2024 had given back a bit of that performance today. “We’re seeing the market down on weakness from things like Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland Airport, Infratil and Mainfreight. “There’s just a bit of profit taking there.” Shares in Fisher & Paykel fell 1.04% or 40c to $38, while Auckland Airport was down 1.95% or 17c to $8.53. Infratil declined 1.87% or 23.5c to $12.365 and Mainfreight ended the day a touch lower, dropping 1c to $73.49. Solly said people were taking a more cautious wait-and-see approach. Long-term bond yields, the 10-year government bond yields, had been tracking higher off the back of question marks around what the incoming US President Donald Trump might do. Solly expected the market to continue to be quiet next week with many people still away on holiday but there could be updates from some retail companies in late January which will reveal how the Christmas shopping period went for them. Retail spending data showed while Boxing Day had been strong, activity was weaker in the lead-up to Christmas. Some property stocks had a bit of a bounce and BlackRock had sold some of its shares in Kiwi Property Group, reducing its stake from 5.334% to 4.981%. Kiwi Property shares rose 1.11% or 1c to 91c, Precinct Properties was up 2.97% or 3.5c to $1.215 and Argosy Property climbed 1.5% or 1.5c to $1.015. One area Solly was keeping an eye on was the Chinese sharemarket which had a weak day on Thursday. Investors were hoping for more stimulus to come. “We need the Chinese economy to be at least stabilising for some of our exporters. It’s probably had the weakest start [to the year] for some time. And so there’s a bit of weariness about that.” Blis Technologies, Sky Network Television and Pacific Edge saw the biggest percentage jumps in their share prices. Blis rose 6.67% or 0.001c to 1.6c, Sky was up 5.77% or 15c to 2.75 and Pacific Edge climbed 5.6% or 0.007c to 13.2c. General Capital, Promisia Healthcare and Eroad saw the biggest percentage declines. Eroad was down 5.31% or 6c to $1.07. Wall Street stocks opened 2025 on a tepid note falling modestly as markets await a heavier news flow later in January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4% at 42,392.27. The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 5868.55, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.2% to 19,280.79. - additional reporting AFP Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Read Between the Lies: A Pattern Recognition Guide

Time Published: 2025-01-03T03:33:51Z

EditorEconomy Brownstone Institute, josh stylman Josh Stylman Brownstone Institute When Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, announced during Event 201’s pandemic drill in 2019 that they would “flood the zone with trusted sources,” few understood this preview of coordinated narrative control. Within months, we watched it unfold in real time—unified messaging across all platforms, suppression of dissent, and coordinated narrative control that fooled much of the world. But not everyone stayed fooled forever. Some saw through it immediately, questioning every aspect from day one. Others thought it was just incompetent government trying to protect us. Many initially accepted the precautionary principle—better safe than sorry. But as each policy failure pointed in the same direction—toward more control and less human agency—the pattern became impossible to ignore. Anyone not completely subsumed by the system eventually had to confront its true purpose: not protecting health or safety, but expanding control. Once you recognize this pattern of deception, two questions should immediately arise whenever major stories dominate headlines: “What are they lying about?” and “What are they distracting us from?” The pattern of coordinated deception becomes unmistakable. Consider how media outlets spent three years pushing Russiagate conspiracies, driving unprecedented social division while laying the groundwork for what would become the greatest psychological operation in history. Today, while the media floods us with Ukraine coverage, BlackRock positions itself to profit from both the destruction and reconstruction. The pattern becomes unmistakable once you see it—manufactured crises driving pre-planned “solutions” that always expand institutional control. Mainstream media operates on twin deceptions: misdirection and manipulation. The same anchors who sold us WMDs in Iraq, promoted “Russia collusion,” and insisted Hunter Biden’s laptop was “Russian disinformation” still occupy prime time slots. Just as we see with RFK, Jr.’s HHS nomination, the pattern is consistent: coordinated attacks replace substantive debate, identical talking points appear across networks, and legitimate questions are dismissed through character assassination rather than evidence. Being consistently wrong isn’t a bug—it’s a feature. Their role isn’t to inform but to manufacture consent. The template is consistent: Saturate media with emotional spectacles while advancing institutional agendas with minimal scrutiny. Like learning to spot a fake smile or hearing a false note in music, you develop an instinct for the timing: Money and Power: Medical Control: Digital Control: As these deceptions become more obvious, different forms of resistance emerge. The truth-seeking takes different forms. Some become deep experts in specific deceptions—documenting early treatment successes with repurposed drugs, uncovering hospital protocol failures, or exploring the impact of vaccine injuries. Others develop a broader lens for seeing how narratives themselves are engineered. Walter Kirn’s brilliant pattern recognition cuts to the heart of our manufactured reality. His tweets dissecting the United CEO murder coverage expose how even violent crimes are now packaged as entertainment spectacles, complete with character arcs and narrative twists. Kirn’s insight highlights a critical dimension of media control: by turning every crisis into an entertainment narrative, they divert attention from deeper questions. Instead of asking why institutional safeguards fail or who benefits, audiences become captivated by carefully scripted outrage. This deliberate distraction ensures that institutional agendas move forward without scrutiny. His insight reveals how entertainment packaging serves the broader control system. While each investigation requires its own expertise, this pattern of narrative manipulation connects to a larger grid of deception. As I’ve explored in “The Information Factory” and “Engineering Reality,” everything from education to medicine to currency itself has been captured by systems designed to shape not just our choices, but our very perception of reality. Most revealing is what they don’t cover. Notice how quickly stories disappear when they threaten institutional interests. Remember the Epstein client list? The Maui land grab? The mounting vaccine injuries? The silence speaks volumes. Consider the recent whistleblower testimonies revealing suppressed safety concerns at Boeing, a company long entangled with regulatory agencies and government contracts. Two whistleblowers—both former employees who raised alarms about safety issues—died under suspicious circumstances. Coverage of their deaths disappeared almost overnight, despite the profound implications for public safety and corporate accountability. This pattern repeats in countless cases where accountability would disrupt entrenched power structures, leaving crucial questions unanswered and narratives tightly controlled. These decisions aren’t accidental—they result from media ownership, advertiser influence, and government pressure, ensuring the narrative remains tightly controlled. But perhaps most striking isn’t the media’s deception itself, but how thoroughly it shapes its consumers’ reality. Watch how confidently they repeat phrases clearly engineered in think tanks. Listen as they parrot talking points with religious conviction: “January 6th was worse than 9/11,” “Trust The Science™,” “Democracy is on the ballot” and, perhaps the most consequential lie in modern history, “Safe and Effective.” The professional-managerial class proves especially susceptible to this programming. Their expertise becomes a prison of status—the more they’ve invested in institutional approval, the more fervently they defend institutional narratives. Watch how quickly a doctor who questions vaccine safety loses his license, how swiftly a professor questioning gender ideology faces review, how rapidly a journalist stepping out of line gets blacklisted. The system ensures compliance through economic capture: your mortgage becomes your leash, your professional status your prison guard. The same lawyers who prides themselves on critical thinking will aggressively shut down any questioning of official narratives. The professor who teaches “questioning power structures” becomes apoplectic when students question pharmaceutical companies. The circular validation makes the programming nearly impenetrable: This self-reinforcing system forms a perfect closed loop: Each component validates the others while excluding outside information. Try finding the entry point for actual truth in this closed system. The professional class’s pride in their critical thinking becomes darkly ironic—they’ve simply outsourced their opinions to “authoritative sources.” Most disturbing is how willingly they’ve surrendered their sovereignty. Watch them defer: Their empathy becomes a weapon used against them. Question lockdowns? You’re killing grandma. Doubt transition surgery for minors? You’re causing suicides. Resist equity initiatives? You’re perpetuating oppression. The programming works by making resistance feel like cruelty. Something remarkable is happening beneath the surface noise: a genuine awakening that defies traditional political boundaries. You see it in the subtle exchanges between colleagues when official narratives strain credibility. In the growing silence at dinner parties as propaganda talking points fall flat. In the knowing looks between strangers when public health theatre reaches new heights of absurdity. This isn’t a movement in the traditional sense—it can’t be, since traditional movement structures are vulnerable to infiltration, subversion, and capture. Instead, it’s more like a spontaneous emergence of pattern recognition. A distributed awakening without central leadership or formal organization. Those who see through the patterns recognize the mass formation for what it is, while its subjects project their own programming onto others, dismissing pattern recognition as “conspiracy theories,” “anti-science,” or other reflexive labels designed to prevent genuine examination. The hardest truth isn’t recognizing the programming—it’s confronting what it means for human consciousness and society itself. We’re watching real-time evidence that most human minds can be captured and redirected through sophisticated psychological operations. Their thoughts aren’t their own, yet they’d die defending what they’ve been programmed to believe. This isn’t just media criticism anymore—it’s an existential question about human consciousness and free will. What does it mean when a species’ capacity for independent thought can be so thoroughly hijacked? When natural empathy and moral instincts become weapons of control? When education and expertise actually decrease resistance to programming? The programming works because it hijacks core human drives: Each natural human trait becomes a vulnerability to be exploited. The most educated become the most programmable because their status addiction runs deepest. Their “critical thinking” becomes a script running on corrupted hardware. This is the core challenge of our time: Can human consciousness evolve faster than the systems designed to hijack it? Can pattern recognition and awareness spread faster than manufactured consensus? Can enough people learn to read between the lies before the programming becomes complete? The stakes could not be higher. This isn’t just about politics or media literacy—it’s about the future of human consciousness itself. Whether our species maintains the capacity for independent thought may depend on those who can still access it helping others break free from the spell. The matrix of control deepens daily, but so does the awakening. The question is: Which spreads faster—the programming or the awareness of it? Our future as a species may depend on the answer.

Title: Frax Partners With Securitize on New Stablecoin

Decentralized stablecoin cryptocurrency protocol Frax Finance launched a stablecoin that it said offers “unprecedented” transparency and custody. The frxUSD stablecoin is a rebranded evolution of the company’s flagship FRAX stablecoin and will leverage BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), tokenized by Securitize, Frax said in a Thursday (Jan. 2) press release. The new stablecoin offers direct fiat redemption capabilities and enhanced compliance with U.S. financial systems, according to the release. “By partnering with Securitize to access and leverage BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund we are setting a new standard for stablecoins,” Frax Finance Founder Sam Kazemian said in the release. “frxUSD combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology with the trust and stability of BlackRock’s prime treasury offerings.” In this new collaboration around the stablecoin, BUIDL will become an enshrined custodian asset for minting and redeeming frxUSD; the stablecoin will be backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements held in BUIDL; and frxUSD will offer seamless fiat on/off-ramping capabilities via the BUIDL infrastructure, per the release. “Tokenized real-world assets provide an excellent bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing institutional-grade investments on-chain with unprecedented transparency and efficiency,” Securitize Co-Founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in the release. “This collaboration exemplifies the next stage in financial evolution, demonstrating how traditional and decentralized systems can work together to redefine asset management strategies.” Stablecoins are emerging as a powerful tool bridging the gap between traditional financial technology and the world of cryptocurrencies, PYMNTS reported in October. As cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset (usually a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro), stablecoins are able to offer the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology while providing the familiarity and stability of fiat currencies. In another, separate development, it was reported Thursday that stablecoin leader Tether has seen its market value decline amid new European Union (EU) cryptocurrency rules, with the company’s USDT having its sharpest weekly drop in two years. USDT had reached a record market value in mid-December but declined after several EU-based exchanges and Coinbase removed the stablecoin due to compliance issues with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that took full effect on Dec. 30. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

RBI는 은행이 대출 손실을 충당하는 방식을 기존의 발생 손실 접근 방식에서 예상 신용 손실 모델로 '전환할 것'을 제안했습니다. 올해 최종 가이드라인이 발표될 예정이며, 국영 은행에 미치는 '재정적 영향'이 민간 은행보다 클 것으로 보입니다. 5. 더 나아가 억만장자들의 배틀 India's cities have neither resources nor leadership, writes @andymukherjee70.

A key gauge of the Indian rupee’s volatility jumped to its highest level in over a year, fueling speculation that the nation’s central bank may be easing its tight grip on the currency amid a strong US dollar https://t.co/jAOOB0oubY Rupee ends at record closing low for seventh straight session https://t.co/Q3Svg01OWN pic.twitter.com/p3Lk9htI5Z 목표는 힘들고 종종 혼란스러운 법을 간결하고 명확하며 소송의 소지를 줄이는 것입니다. 봄베이 상공회의소는 2022년 '데이터'를 인용해 10조 루피가 넘는 직접 세금 요구가 소송에 휘말려 있다고 밝혔습니다. India’s central bank has started to rein in its ballooning non-deliverable forwards book, sources say, shifting away from one of its key tools to push back against the strong dollar https://t.co/rsNtdcORnz The dollar is headed for its best year in almost a decade, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rising over 7% so far this year https://t.co/qGYRBTeOok The selling by foreign investors of Indian stocks in 2024 was the second highest in a decade as announcement of a stimulus package in China, rich valuations, rising US bond yields and subdued second-quarter earnings resulted in risk-off sentiment.https://t.co/j9nuDpDtd3 '모디' 행정부는 또한 '특정 재정 적자'(FY26 GDP의 4.5%)를 목표로 하는 것에서 FY27에는 GDP 대비 부채 비율로 전환할 계획이며, 이를 위한 프레임워크는 올해 공개될 예정입니다. Investors will zero in on earnings growth to pick out new winners, as Indian stocks aim to extend an unprecedented annual streak despite economic challenges https://t.co/cMJlKPT5iw Some big lenders in India have asked the central bank to inject liquidity using foreign-exchange swaps as short-term currency financing costs surged to a four-year high, sources say https://t.co/owusgzFgRK 블룸버그 통신은 이전에 새로운 징조(glide path)가 중앙 정부 부채를 GDP의 58.2%에서 50%로 줄이는 것을 목표로 할 것이라고 '보도'한 바 있습니다. 새로운 일정은 '모디' 총리가 3기 동안 인프라, 사회 계획 및 성장을 촉진하기 위해 얼마나 많은 지출 여력을 확보할지 명확하게 보여줄 것입니다. 4. 크레디트 퀄리티는 철저히 검증될 것입니다. India’s policymakers differed on the timing for interest rate cuts as growth remains weak and volatile food prices keep inflation high, minutes of the RBI’s monetary policy committee meeting showed https://t.co/DNHjXNO0oP Bad loan ratios in Indian banks are expected to worsen, the Reserve Bank of India said in a report https://t.co/mRwxYJVLql Indian banks' gross bad loan ratio may edge up by March 2026, central bank report says https://t.co/2FJ93HqS0x pic.twitter.com/I5e9yqKkdk #Loan against #gold on rise, #RBI raises concerns over irregular practices involved in #GoldLoanshttps://t.co/Gv7JDVGJRx 소비자 대출 및 소액 금융 부문의 지속적인 스트레스와 회계 규칙의 변경은 신용 품질에 대한 철저한 조사를 '촉발'할 것입니다. 인도 중앙은행은 은행 전체의 총 부실채권 비율이 2024년 9월 다년간의 최저치인 2.6%에서 2026년 3%로, 비은행의 경우 2.9%에서 3.4%로 상승할 것으로 '예상'하고 있습니다. 그러나 RBI는 은행과 비은행권 금융업체의 자본 수준이 건전성 기준을 훨씬 상회하고 있다고 '지적'했습니다. Indian banks to stick with certificates of deposit after 2024 supply jumps 50% https://t.co/pYZDUDiOEp pic.twitter.com/vXJVSaIMGG Overseas investors turned net sellers of Indian stocks last year as concerns over a slowing economy and higher valuations spooked sentiment https://t.co/NPG3SxFKAY Indian states' fundraising may get expensive amid record borrowing, investors say https://t.co/gFrW4K4vNJ pic.twitter.com/05dnGlu31K 올해 은행들은 2022년부터 논의되어 온 회계 규칙 변경에도 직면해 있습니다. RBI는 은행이 대출 손실을 충당하는 방식을 기존의 발생 손실 접근 방식에서 예상 신용 손실 모델로 '전환할 것'을 제안했습니다. 올해 최종 가이드라인이 발표될 예정이며, 국영 은행에 미치는 '재정적 영향'이 민간 은행보다 클 것으로 보입니다. 5. 더 나아가 억만장자들의 배틀 India's cities have neither resources nor leadership, writes @andymukherjee70. They need to be in control of their own destinies to break a cycle of mediocrity https://t.co/OoFqHUWrLi India’s booming and coal-dependent steel industry means the country faces a “rocky and uncertain path” toward achieving its goal of reaching net zero by 2070, according to Global Energy Monitor https://t.co/l09Eb7dV7t While analysts have turned more bullish on Mukesh Ambani's Reliance recently, institutional investors are expressing concerns over increasing debt and its ability to generate positive cash flows https://t.co/XEYsiTtiuF India’s state oil refiners are finding it hard to buy the volume of Russian crude they need, sources say https://t.co/4gMR2bcWkY Musk's meeting with the South African president could let SpaceX deploy Starlink in exchange for a Tesla battery plant.https://t.co/hLpcRPDCb7 테슬라(TSLA) '일론 머스크'와 인도 억만장자 '무케시 암바니', 수닐 미탈, '쿠마르 망갈람 비를라'가 인도에서 광대역 '위성' 인터넷 서비스를 제공하기 위한 전장이 될 것입니다. 카플레이, 자율주행 등 차량에도 인터넷이 필요하죠. 전기차는 스마트폰과 연동됩니다. '일론 머스크'는 X(트위터)를 '페이팔'처럼 결재 시스템을 쓰는 모바일 뱅킹으로 만들어 비트코인으로 테슬라(TSLA)를 결재려던 것으로 알려졌습니다. Swiggy ends listing day with 17% gain over IPO issue price.

Ambani의 승리에 따라 그의 통신 및 소매 벤처가 올해 오랫동안 보류 중인 IPO를 시작할지 '여부가 결정'될 것입니다.

Title: Morgan Stanley Is Latest Bank to Exit UN-backed Climate Group

Morgan Stanley became the latest major bank to quit the U.N.-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 2, the New York-based financial services company said it had “decided to withdraw” from the voluntary climate pact sponsored by the U.N. Environment Programme Finance Initiative. In a statement, Morgan Stanley said its “commitment to net-zero remains unchanged.” “We aim to contribute to real-economy decarbonization by providing our clients with the advice and capital required to transform business models and reduce carbon intensity,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed emissions targets.” Representatives of Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times. Net zero is a term for the practice of balancing greenhouse gas emissions with the amount taken out of the atmosphere. Morgan Stanley has published an environmental and social policy statement. The document, most recently updated in September 2024, says the company considers emissions when financing projects related to the generation of electricity as well as to oil and gas exploration and development. “Our approach to managing climate risks, including transition risks and physical risks, and pursuing transition finance opportunities is informed by our climate strategy and overall goal of achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050,” it said in the document. On its website, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance calls itself a “group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” In its most recent annual progress report, published in October 2024, the group said its membership has grown to 144 banks since its founding in April 2021. Representatives of the alliance declined to comment on the Morgan Stanley decision. With its Thursday decision, Morgan Stanley joined a rash of U.S. banks that have departed the alliance within the past month. On Dec. 31, Citigroup and Bank of America said they were leaving the alliance. Those exits followed the December exit of Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. In November, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, filed an anti-trust suit against BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street Corp. In a statement released on Nov. 27, Paxton said the three companies “formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices.” The three companies weaponized influence from their stock holdings to pressure coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals and reduce coal output by more than half by 2030, Paxton’s statement said.

Title: FBI Claims to Disrupt Florida Plot to Attack Pro-Israel Organization
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2025/01/02/fbi-claims-disrupt-florida-plot-attack-pro-israel-organization/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T22:17:51Z
Full Content:
The FBI filed court documents this week accusing Gainesville, Florida, resident Forrest Kendall Pemberton of plotting to attack the South Florida offices of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) with multiple firearms. Pemberton, 26, was reported missing by his father on December 23. His father, unnamed in police reports, told the Gainesville police department he received a text message from Pemberton advising him to look in the backpack he left in his bedroom. The backpack proved to contain a “concerning” note that “espoused anti-authority sentiments” and looked disturbingly like a farewell message. Pemberton’s father added that his son had previously “espoused antisemitic views.” Pemberton’s father said the search history in his son’s browser included various government offices and prominent entities, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), Blackrock, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and AIPAC. Pemberton’s searches also included information on various assassination methods, including the use of poisons and vehicles as weapons. Most disturbingly under the circumstances, Pemberton owned several firearms, including two rifles and a pistol, which were missing from his room. His father thought he might have been planning an assault similar to the December 4 murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Everything We Know About Dual New Years Terror Attacks with Joel Pollak Police investigators tracked Pemberton down to a motel in Plantation, Florida, where his browser history indicated he had researched the location of an AIPAC office. AIPAC relocated its office some time ago, but Google Maps still pointed to the old address. The police learned that Pemberton stayed at the motel in Plantation for only one day, checking out on December 24 and resurfacing in Tallahassee, where he employed ride-sharing service Uber to get from an auto shop to a Red Roof Inn. The FBI kept the hotel under surveillance and intercepted Pemberton when he was getting into another rideshare vehicle. He was carrying all three of his firearms when he was intercepted on December 25, which in 2024 was both Christmas Day and the first day of Hanukkah. Pemberton told investigators he was using rideshares because his original plan had involved walking from Gainesville to nearby Ocala, where he purchased a very cheap Ford F-150 truck he apparently intended to use in a criminal assault. The F-150 apparently gave him some trouble on the road to Tallahassee. In its affidavit to prosecutors, the FBI said Pemberton targeted AIPAC because of its “political influence” and his “frustration with the status quo.” Asked if he was planning a suicide attack, he said he had not settled on the “suicide” part yet. “Um, I really don’t know if I was gonna end it with my life or not. I hadn’t gotten that far yet. It entirely depended if I ended up getting caught or not. If caught, that was a way out,” he said. “It would have been a one-way ticket. In Plantation, I decided I wasn’t ready. I gave up,” he said. The FBI affidavit was vague about exactly what Pemberton was doing in Tallahassee, which is on the opposite side of the huge Florida peninsula from Plantation, requiring at least seven hours of driving time. The most efficient route between the two cities would have taken Pemberton through his hometown of Gainesville. Tallahassee is the state capital, so it is possible Pemberton was contemplating another target after canceling his alleged plan to attack AIPAC in Plantation. AIPAC was not mentioned by name in the affidavit, being described only as an organization dedicated to “pro-Israel policies that strengthen and expand the U.S.-Israel relationship,” but AIPAC confirmed it was the intended target in a statement on Tuesday. “We will not be deterred by extremists in pursuing our mission to strengthen the relationship with America’s valued ally, Israel. We are deeply appreciative of the FBI’s work to stop this individual,” AIPAC said. The Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Pemberton with stalking on Monday, and contended he was scouting AIPAC offices with the intent of “killing, injuring, harassing, and intimidating” members of the organization. Pemberton’s case is scheduled for a hearing on Monday at the U.S. Courthouse in Gainesville. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: As Hope of Santa Claus Rally Fades, What's Next for Stocks in 2025?

Santa may not be visiting Wall Street this year after all. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday and has lost ground in five straight sessions, giving investors little hope of getting a Santa Claus rally, which is the tendency for stocks to rise during the last five sessions of a year and the first two of the new year. The index would have to rise 1.8% on Friday to get back into positive territory for the seven-day period this year. Granted, 2024 was an exceptional year for stocks, even without an end-of-year boost. The S&P 500 rose more than 20% for a second straight year, its first such stretch this millennium. But a Santa Claus rally is more than just a cherry on top of a year; it’s sometimes also seen as an omen. The Santa Claus rally is historically correlated with stocks’ January and full-year performance. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has, on average, returned 1.4% in January and 10.4% in the calendar year after a Santa Claus rally, according to a recent analysis by LPL Financial. (The S&P 500 was launched in 1957; stock performance before this year is based on its predecessor index, the S&P 90.) In years without a Santa Claus rally, the index’s average January return has been slightly negative and its full-year return has averaged just 5%. While the odds of a Santa Claus rally appeared slim on Thursday, stock market experts remain optimistic about the prospects for 2025. Stocks are generally expected to be supported by incoming President Donald Trump, who has vowed to extend the corporate tax cuts of his first term and slash regulations. The U.S. economy’s continued strength is also expected to underpin corporate profits, which experts believe will broaden after two years of narrow leadership. The Magnificent Seven stocks are still expected to grow profit faster than the average S&P 500 company, but by the slimmest margin in seven years, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze is also seen evolving this year as the use of AI becomes more widespread. A small number of companies—most of them semiconductor and networking hardware companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO)—have thus far benefited from the AI revolution. Experts believe a greater variety of companies will begin to reap those benefits in 2025 as new infrastructure comes online and businesses find novel applications for the technology. Donald Trump is known for treating the stock market’s performance as a proxy for the success of his administration. Yet, his impending presidency is a major source of uncertainty, which could make for a bumpy ride this year. Many of Trump’s signature policy proposals, if implemented, could have knock-on effects that drag on stocks. His proposed tariffs could help stoke inflation by disrupting global supply chains and raising costs for businesses. Deportations of the magnitude Trump has promised would likely also boost inflation. Resurgent inflation could force Federal Reserve officials to keep interest rates at a level they deem “restrictive,” which would stifle consumer demand and put extra pressure on businesses. Higher interest rates also would likely translate to higher bond yields and a stronger dollar, both of which would weigh on riskier assets like stocks.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

BlackRock Enhanced Government Fund, Inc. (NYSE: EGF), BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (NYSE: DSU), BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund, Inc. (NYSE: FRA), BlackRock Floating Rate Income Trust (NYSE: BGT), BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc. (NYSE: HYT), BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE: BTZ), BlackRock Limited Duration Income Trust (NYSE: BLW), BlackRock Core Bond Trust (NYSE: BHK), BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (NYSE: BIT), BlackRock Income Trust, Inc. (NYSE: BKT) and BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (NYSE: BBN) have adopted a Plan to support a level monthly distribution of income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available net income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Code. If sufficient income (inclusive of net investment income and short-term capital gains) is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. Each of the above-listed Funds is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. Each Fund may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act. Each Fund's estimated sources of the distributions paid as of December 23, 2024 and for its current fiscal year are as follows: Estimated Allocations as of December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital EGF2 $0.041000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.041000 (100%) BKT2 $0.088200 $0.031842 (36%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.056358 (64%) DSU2 $0.098730 $0.066477 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.032253 (33%) FRA2 $0.123840 $0.082821 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.041019 (33%) BBN2 $0.092900 $0.075240 (81%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.017660 (19%) BGT2 $0.120280 $0.077761 (65%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.042519 (35%) HYT2 $0.077900 $0.057524 (74%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.020376 (26%) BTZ2 $0.083900 $0.053653 (64%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.030247 (36%) BLW2 $0.113200 $0.086118 (76%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.027082 (24%) BHK2 $0.074600 $0.046016 (62%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.028584 (38%) BIT2 $0.123700 $0.074047 (60%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.049653 (40%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital EGF2 $0.492000 $0.347520 (71%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.144480 (29%) BKT2 $1.058400 $0.407235 (38%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.651165 (62%) DSU2 $1.184760 $0.868317 (73%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.316443 (27%) FRA2 $1.486080 $1.167738 (79%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.318342 (21%) BBN2 $1.114800 $0.909791 (82%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.205009 (18%) BGT2 $1.443360 $1.035274 (72%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.408086 (28%) HYT2 $0.934800 $0.708910 (76%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.225890 (24%) BTZ2 $1.006800 $0.674191 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.332609 (33%) BLW2 $1.326600 $1.109627 (84%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.216973 (16%) BHK2 $0.895200 $0.565787 (63%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.329413 (37%) BIT2 $1.484400 $0.919736 (62%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.564664 (38%) 2The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send its stockholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will illustrate how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Each Plan will be subject to ongoing review by the Board to determine whether the Plan should be continued, modified or terminated. The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders.

Title: Bloomberg Highlights BlackRock’s Bitcoin Fund As The Greatest ETF Launch In History
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bloomberg-highlights-blackrocks-bitcoin-fund/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T21:30:12Z
Full Content:
According to Bloomberg, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new benchmark in the world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since its launch in January 2024. With over $50 billion in assets amassed in just 11 months, IBIT has achieved a feat unparalleled in the industry, outpacing traditional funds that have been operating for decades. BlackRock’s foray into the Bitcoin market has been a pivotal moment not only for BTC, but also for the broader cryptocurrency market. With over $11 trillion in assets under management, the firm’s endorsement has contributed to Bitcoin’s move beyond the $100,000 mark for the first time, ushering in a wave of institutional interest and attracting investors who were previously skeptical about the digital asset. However, the journey to establishing a spot-Bitcoin ETF in the United States has been fraught with challenges. The Winklevoss twins pioneered the effort in 2013, only to face repeated rejections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale Investments, on the other hand, spearheaded a legal battle against the SEC, culminating in a crucial victory in 2023 when a federal appeals court overturned the agency’s prior rejection of its ETF application. As the landscape shifted, BlackRock’s entry, led by CEO Larry Fink—who had once disparaged Bitcoin—signaled a significant change in attitude within traditional finance. Once the SEC granted approval in January 2024, BlackRock and other firms such as Fidelity and VanEck successfully launched the first cohort of US ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin, collectively amassing around $107 billion in assets. Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities, highlighted that IBIT’s rapid growth eclipses the combined assets of more than 50 European-focused ETFs, many of which have been established for over 20 years. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, aptly described IBIT as “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart also noted that IBIT is the fastest ETF to reach significant milestones, further solidifying its status as a revolutionary product in the financial landscape. Amidst a growing spot Bitcoin ETF market, IBIT has distinguished itself with its rapid asset growth, reaching over $50 billion five times faster than the next closest fund, which took nearly four years. As it stands, IBIT has surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF, the second-largest gold fund globally, despite significant inflows into that fund this year. The impact of IBIT on Bitcoin’s market dynamics is profound. The ETF has been instrumental in Bitcoin’s 118% price rally year-to-date, with IBIT accounting for over 50% of daily trading volume among Bitcoin ETFs. IBIT also made history by being the first Bitcoin ETF to offer options, which have quickly become some of the most traded contracts in the ETF market, averaging about $1.7 billion in daily notional volume. According to research from Asym500, other Bitcoin ETFs have struggled to achieve similar levels of trading activity, highlighting IBIT’s dominance. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, BTC, is trading at $97,190, recording a gain of nearly 3% in the 24-hour time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Headlines Shaping Wall Street for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stands against the other AI stocks. As reported by Reuters, Wall Street’s major indexes started the final trading session of 2024 on a high note, continuing the two-year-long bull market. This was marked by economic recovery after the pandemic, hopes for lower interest rates, and excitement about the AI boom. All three major stock market indexes, the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq, are near record highs and ready for their second consecutive year of gains. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss Despite an overall good year, late 2024 saw a pullback in artificial intelligence stocks. From profit-taking and investors locking in gains from the year's substantial rallies to concerns over high valuations and the Federal Reserve's cautious stance signaling fewer interest rate cuts in 2025, the sector was a bit “choppier” than usual these last few weeks. However, Wall Street analysts expect that the artificial intelligence sector will be in full gear in 2025, with a $2 trillion surge in AI-related capital expenditure over the next three years. Moreover, regulatory discussions around AI ethics and safety, spearheaded by global governments, are creating a supportive environment for innovation. "We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI capex (spending) over the next 3 years”. According to Ives, tech stocks are anticipated to rise 25% in 2025 as Wall Street and investors deal with "a less regulatory spiderweb" under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He also believes that stronger artificial intelligence initiatives in the federal government should give the sector a boost. However, there may be "white-knuckle moments" in the year ahead over Federal Reserve decisions, uncertainty over U.S.-China tariffs, and concerns from critics who believe stock valuations are too high. "This will create the opportunities to own the tech theme and key names which has been our core investing tech playbook the last 2 years”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A software engineer hosting a remote video training session on a multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) provides a general-purpose database platform worldwide that integrates operational, unstructured, and AI-related data to streamline building applications. On December 18, Tigress Financial raised the firm’s price target on MongoDB to $430 from $400 and kept a “Strong Buy” rating on the shares. The analyst told investors in a research note that MongoDB will continue to see growing developer adoption and increasing momentum in its Atlas Database-as-a-Service platform. The Atlas Database-as-a-Service platform is a multi-cloud developer data platform that streamlines how you build with data. This increase is driven by burgeoning AI capabilities as the company continues to capture market share in the most critical and strategic areas of the enterprise software sector. The firm also said that the company’s ongoing AI integration and entry into new industries will lead to greater enterprise adoption, customer penetration, international expansion, and acceleration in Business Performance trends. Overall MDB ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MDB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MDB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) stands against the other organic food and farming stocks. Organic farming practices focus on using natural methods to cultivate crops, avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This approach not only enhances the quality of food but also contributes to preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems. The organic food and farming sector provides economic benefits as well, creating jobs and supporting rural communities. The global organic food and farming industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier and more sustainable food options. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global organic food market was valued at $244.82 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $489.75 billion by the end of the forecast period. This growth is largely driven by increasing awareness of health benefits associated with organic products and a growing concern for environmental sustainability.

This marks an impressive increase of 26.6% or 20.3 million hectares compared to the previous year. Australia continues to lead the world in organic farming area, boasting 53 million hectares, an increase of 17.3 million hectares. The report shows that organic farming area increased across all continents, reflecting a global trend towards more sustainable agricultural practices. In terms of producers, the number of organic farmers worldwide rose to 4.5 million in 2022, which is nearly a 26% increase from 2021. Support for organic agriculture is gaining momentum globally, with many countries implementing action plans to promote organic farming practices. The number of fully implemented national regulations for organic agriculture rose to 75 in 2023, indicating a commitment to enhancing and regulating this sector. According to the report, the global organic market reached nearly EUR 135 billion in 2022.

Title: Morgan Stanley joins Goldman Sachs, Citi in exodus from UN-backed climate alliance

Morgan Stanley said on Thursday it had decided to leave a UN-backed climate alliance — joining rivals Goldman Sachs and Citi in ditching the group amid conservative backlash toward environmental and diversity initiatives. The Wall Street investment bank gave no reason for its decision to exit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Citigroup and Bank of America said they were leaving the group earlier this week, and Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo made the same announcement in early December. The NZBA declined to comment. In a statement, Morgan Stanley told The Post it is still committed to achieving net-zero financed emissions and will continue to “report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed emissions targets.” A US-based environmental advocacy group urged New York state on Thursday to regulate the financial sector and ensure its policies align with climate goals. “These exits reveal the inadequacy of voluntary commitments and underscore the urgent need for state-level leadership and regulation,” Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY, said in a statement. In November, Texas led a lawsuit of 11 Republican states against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The states accused the money managers of “conspiring to artificially constrict” the coal market with anticompetitive practices, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a press release. The states alleged the firms built up huge stakes in coal producers and then supported environmental initiatives that lessened coal production to send prices skyward. Republican-led campaigns against environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, which include diversity and inclusion policies, gained steam last year. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck, for example, spearheaded a series of successful boycotts on X to pressure US companies to dissolve their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. Most recently, Nissan Motor announced in December it would roll back its diversity initiatives after “productive conversations” with Starbuck. Other major red-state employers like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson and Walmart last year axed their diversity initiatives. In a statement, Citi told The Post that it decided to leave the NZBA to focus its attention on the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) as the group undergoes a restructuring. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that GFANZ, an umbrella group for climate alliances, is adjusting how it works with its industry-specific sub-groups after the wave of bank retreats, according to a person familiar with the decision. Companies can now go to GFANZ for guidance on climate initiatives, but they don’t have to pledge to the NZBA, which follows the Paris agreement and its net-zero goals, according to the report. “In light of this shift, and Citi’s progress towards its own net zero goals, we have decided to leave the Net Zero Banking Alliance,” Citi said in a statement. “We remain committed to reaching net zero and continue to be transparent about our progress.” Goldman Sachs, which announced it was quitting the climate initiative in December, said it has made significant progress on its net-zero goals and remains committed to sustainability. “We have the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients,” the bank told The Post in a statement. “Goldman Sachs is also very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world.” Wells Fargo declined to comment on its decision to leave the NZBA, and Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Throughout 2024, Morgan Stanley backed off some of its previous environmental goals. In a report published in September, the bank left out an earlier pledge to remove or reduce 50 million metric tons of plastic waste by 2030. The bank also warned of “unintended consequences” from too quickly taking away financing for high-carbon clients who later plan to decarbonize. Advertisement

Title: ETF Companies Are Racing to Launch the Next ‘Hot’ Crypto Fund

(Bloomberg) -- Purveyors of exchange-traded funds are finding ever more creative — and potentially riskier — ways to lure investors into the crypto craze. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue Detroit’s Michigan Central Is the Building Revival Story of 2024 Burned Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces A Commuting Resolution for 2025: Ride Your Local Subway or Bus Paperwork covering a plethora of newfangled offerings was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as 2024 was ending. Among the proposed products was an ETF from ProShares that would denominate the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Funds planned by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares would offer exposure to convertible bonds issued by companies to buy Bitcoin. And ETF company Volatility Shares envisions getting inverse and leveraged Solana funds off the ground, alongside a vehicle that would track the sixth-largest digital token using futures contracts. “This is the continued evolution of launches to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs. We’ll see a lot of these in 2025,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis. “It’s the hot thing — issuers love to strike when the theme is hot. We’ll see crypto everything.” All in all, the filings, if approved, would bring about more than a dozen new crypto-centric funds to the space in 2025, just a year after the inception of the first-ever US Bitcoin ETFs. 2024 was a banner year for all things crypto, which saw Bitcoin — the world’s largest digital asset — surge more than 120% to cross above $100,000. That boost happened thanks in part to incoming president Donald Trump’s embrace of the industry, with many market-watchers betting that a looser regulatory stance by his administration could help the crypto space grow further. The enthusiasm over his election helped push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF — one by BlackRock — above $37 billion for the year, the third-most of all funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bitcoin fan and MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor also took advantage of surging crypto prices by doubling down on his tactic of purchasing the largest token for the company’s reserves. MicroStrategy has been using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help finance the buying — and other companies have similar plans. According to a filing, the REX ETF intends to invest a majority of its assets in convertible bonds issued by firms that hold Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies, according to paperwork filed last week. “It is rare that a new asset class comes around for the investing masses, and that’s what crypto is now — and Wall Street is always great at creating supply when there is demand,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. “So this is the evolution of the crypto ETF spectrum: futures-based, spot, thematic, and now convertibles, both hyper specific for MicroStrategy and whoever else gets involved in a similar capacity.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Is Not Having a Happy New Year Zyn’s Online Hype Risks Leading to the Nicotine Pouches’ Downfall What Will Elon Musk Do in 2025?

Nick Timoney has agreed a new contract to remain with Ulster until at least 2027 Nick Timoney believes Ulster is the place for him to become “the best I can be” after committing his future with the province until at least 2027. The 29-year-old back-row has signed a two-year contract extension and insists he is ready to be part of a bright future at Ravenhill. Timoney is a key component of Richie Murphy’s squad and delivered a Player of the Match performance last weekend as captain, with Ulster ending a five-game losing run with a 17-7 inter-pro victory over Connacht in Galway. One of Ulster’s longest-serving players having first joined the Ulster Academy in 2015, the former Blackrock College student made his senior debut for the province eight years ago and his full Ireland bow in 2021 against the United States. He has accumulated over 150 caps for Ulster but Timoney isn’t done yet, stating Ravenhill is a place that feels like home to him while expressing his confidence that the side’s new era will be a prosperous one. “I’m delighted to sign a new deal with Ulster,” he said. “I feel very at home here and believe we have the squad to develop and become better in the years ahead. “We have some young talent coming through that adds to our group of experienced players and that is something that both excites and motivates you for the seasons ahead. “I’ve said I want to keep progressing as a player and I fully believe I can become the best I can be here at Ulster.” Ulster General Manager Bryn Cunningham added: “Agreeing terms with Nick before the Christmas period was a high priority for us, and we are delighted that he is fully invested in what we are trying to build here. “Nick is one of the most well-rounded back-row players in Europe and it’s been no surprise to hear about interest in him from other big clubs. “His journey from the Academy, Sevens, to playing for the ‘A’ team and breaking into the senior side has been full of hard work and dedication, and that has helped him develop into the athlete we see today. “He is someone that is a standard-setter to those around him and is a very popular member of the senior squad because of the attitude, commitment and leadership he puts in every week, and he will be a key part of this team’s future.”

The shake-up comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and it's the latest sign of how tech companies are positioning themselves for a new administration in Washington. Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, said he is stepping down, citing the new year as the right time to move on. He'll be replaced by Kaplan, who will take on the title of chief global affairs officer. Kaplan was White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush, and he appeared at the New York Stock Exchange with Vice President-elect JD Vance and Trump in December. He also attended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing in 2018 as a personal friend, causing a controversy for the social media company. "I will look forward to spending a few months handing over the reins — and to representing the company at a number of international gatherings in Q1 of this year," Clegg wrote in a memo to his staff that he shared on Facebook on Thursday. Clegg joined the company in 2018 after a career in British politics with the Liberal Democrats party, and he helped Meta navigate incredible scrutiny, especially over the company's influence on elections and its efforts to control harmful content. Clegg also helped steer the company through the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook shared user data with third-party political consultants. He also represented the company in Washington and London, frequently at panels for artificial intelligence and at congressional hearings. "My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector," Clegg wrote. In his note, Clegg said Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, would replace Kaplan as Meta's vice president of global policy. He mentioned that Kaplan would work closely with David Ginsburg, the company's vice president of global communications and public affairs. "Nick: I'm grateful for everything you've done for Meta and the world these past seven years," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. "You've ... built a strong team to carry this work forward. I'm excited for Joel to step into this role next given his deep experience and insight leading our policy work for many years."

Title: Report: Apple Has Halted Production Of Its Colossally Expensive Vision Pro VR
URL: https://kotaku.com/apple-vision-pro-vr-mixed-reality-report-1851731279
Time Published: 2025-01-02T18:15:00Z
Full Content:
Apple has certainly carved itself a market for selling extremely well-made products at ludicrously high prices. Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production. This is all based on a report from October 2024 on The Information (a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release. The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either. Back in October, The Information said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech. If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As MacRumors points out, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely. Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame. We’ve contacted Apple for a comment. .

Title: Analyst: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Growth Will Be Ahead of Nvidia in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Wall Street Is Focusing on These 10 AI Stocks as New Year Begins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a “big problem” for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips. “If you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) …. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they’re not really AI plays, they’re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They’ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you’re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that’s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,” Niles said. Niles said stocks can face a “rough” time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed. “The Fed finally admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that’s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 James E. Demmert from Main Street Research recently said during a program on Schwab Network that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) surpassed Nvidia in terms of stock performance and it will do the same when it comes to growth in 2025. “I would say Nvidia for just the massive amount of demand that’s been there for their products. But you know, on a stock performance basis as we know Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) just, you know, got up and just took over and really like a turbocharger passed them in stock performance. And I think that says a lot about that, Nvidia’s growth, you know, a lot of it from the hyperscalers is maybe behind it and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) growth may be ahead of it in 25.” What makes Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. However, the company’s revenue growth is expected to slow over the next two years, with estimates suggesting a 22% YoY growth rate, potentially bringing revenues to around $4 billion by fiscal 2026. If Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) can improve margins by 100 basis points annually, it would be able to generate about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income by FY26, with a present value of $1.3 billion when discounted at 8%. Applying an S&P 500-like growth multiple of 2.5 to 2.75 times earnings, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) would have a P/E of 46, translating to a price target of $27, significantly down from its current price of $42. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 10th on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Top Climate Group for Banks, Insurers, and Asset Managers Is Making Changes

The world’s biggest climate coalition for financial firms is making adjustments after several high-profile banks, insurers and asset managers opted out. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was established in 2021 and operates as an umbrella group for numerous industry-specific climate alliances, will change its relationship with those sub groups, according to a person familiar with the decision who declined to be identified. In practice, it means companies will be able to draw on GFANZ for guidance and assistance, but won’t need to align their operations with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, the person said. The move comes after net zero alliances lost a number of key members against a backdrop of political backlash and regulatory overlap. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. both quit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance [in December]. Last year, a sub group for insurers was hit by a mass exodus amid litigation threats. And in 2022, an equivalent group for asset managers parted ways with Vanguard Group Inc., the world’s second-largest money manager. Read more: Global Insurers’ Climate Alliance Relaunches After Member Exodus GFANZ was formed more than 3 1/2 years ago in the run-up to the COP26 United Nations climate conference in Scotland. Back then, it had two aims: to raise the number of financial institutions committing to net zero, and to facilitate industry discussion on the challenges of the low-carbon transition. Going forward, GFANZ will allow “any financial institution working to mobilize capital and lower the barriers to financing energy transition to participate,” according to a statement from the group. “Without private finance, there can be no global energy transition,” GFANZ said. “For that reason, in 2025 and beyond, GFANZ will redouble its efforts to mobilize private capital.” Under GFANZ’s new structure, companies that aren’t members of a net zero group will be free to work with the alliance, the person familiar said. The change also may make it easier for companies based in emerging economies that haven’t set 2050 net zero goals to seek some form of GFANZ affiliation. While GFANZ has grown in prominence — it now has more than 700 members — it also has become a target of US Republicans who accuse such alliances of functioning as anti fossil-fuel cartels. Such accusations have coincided with an increase in investigations and lawsuits targeting firms perceived to be embracing a pro-climate agenda. With President-elect Donald Trump due to return to the White House in January, the pressure on climate groups is expected to intensify. In addition to bringing together eight sector-specific alliances spanning asset owners to venture capital, GFANZ has been a key actor in efforts to finance the early retirement of coal assets in Asia. What’s more, it’s provided guidance and insights on topics such as transition planning and portfolio alignment. (GFANZ is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.)

Title: The 14 predictions that came true in 2024 — and the 10 that didn’t

And that’s where you come in. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The 24 forecasts we made in 2024, revisited. by Bryan Walsh, Dylan Matthews, Marina Bolotnikova, Sigal Samuel, Kenny Torrella, and Izzie Ramirez Making predictions is a tricky business, and here at Future Perfect, we don’t pretend to have a crystal ball. But we do think there’s real epistemic value in putting our forecasts out there and — just as importantly — owning up to how they turned out. (Something that happens too rarely in the media, as we learned after November’s election.) Looking back at our predictions for 2024, we had a wild ride trying to anticipate a year that threw more than a few curveballs our way. For 2024, we made 24 predictions in total, covering everything from who would win the White House to whether Elon Musk could actually get those Cybertrucks on the road. When the dust settled, we got 14 right and 10 wrong — batting .583. That’s Shohei Ohtani on a hot streak, though down somewhat from our 2023 results. But I did say it was a topsy-turvy year. Some calls were right on the money, though. We correctly saw Trump’s comeback and the GOP taking back the Senate. We nailed it when we said Oppenheimer would grab Best Picture (I mean, who didn’t love watching Cillian Murphy brood for three hours?). And we were spot-on about some big international news, like Claudia Sheinbaum making history as Mexico’s first woman president and Modi keeping his grip on power in India. But hey, nobody’s perfect. We thought the FDA would greenlight MDMA therapy for PTSD — that was a swing and a miss. We seriously underestimated how many Cybertrucks Tesla would crank out. And while we got some tech predictions right (looking at you, Waymo and SpaceX), we whiffed on predicting OpenAI’s moves. The whole point isn’t just to keep score — it’s about getting better at this prediction thing through practice and learning from our mistakes. And in a world that seems to get more unpredictable by the day, we think that’s a pretty useful skill to develop. —Bryan Walsh I like to imagine that at least one incredibly sheltered person is learning this fact from this article: Donald Trump was elected to a second nonconsecutive term as president. There wasn’t much courage or confidence in this prediction, which I put at only 55 percent odds. My basic approach was to try to use a political science model incorporating national polling, and I came up with a prediction of a narrow Trump victory. President Joe Biden was fairly unpopular, and Trump was narrowly leading him in polling. I wasn’t confident that advantage would persist — but it did. I will say that if I had updated my prediction throughout the year, it would have changed a lot. I remember in June, before the disastrous Biden-Trump debate, telling friends I gave Trump a 75 percent chance to win; after the debate, I bumped it up to around 90 percent. When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden and surged in polling compared to her predecessor, I reverted to something like 50-50 odds. The actual race and its contours were changing dramatically, and my sense of the race changed dramatically too. Almost by coincidence, the ultimate election wound up being the narrow contest that polling would’ve predicted at the end of 2023. —Dylan Matthews I think my past self explained the reasoning here well: “There are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it.” Everything did not go right simultaneously for Democrats this election. They had already lost a seat forever when Joe Manchin decided to retire in West Virginia, a place where no other Democrat-caucusing candidate could ever win, which left them with a 50-seat maximum in 2024. Then they lost Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana, red states that were going to be tough for Democrats to hang on to in a presidential election year. Then, in something of a shock, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey was defeated by a private equity multimillionaire who doesn’t really live in the state and can’t tell the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers apart. When that guy wins, you know Democrats are having a bad year. On the plus side, it could’ve been much, much worse for Democrats. Despite Harris losing Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won the Senate race there narrowly. Tammy Baldwin barely hung on in Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin won an open seat in Michigan by 0.3 percentage points, even as those two states went for Trump. If the Senate results had followed the presidential map, Republicans would have a 56-seat majority and no trouble confirming anyone Trump wants in his Cabinet. Instead, they ended up with 53 seats, which might be just small enough to cause Trump actual trouble. —DM My reasoning here was that Republicans held a very small majority in the House going into the election, and Democrats seemed likely to pick up a number of seats in New York in particular due to redistricting. Sure enough, the party picked up three seats in New York, but lost others to pick up only one seat on net — not enough to flip the chamber. In my defense, I was clear this might happen, writing, “There’s still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time.” As it happens, that is the world we live in. But with 220 Republicans in the House and 218 needed to pass anything, there might not be much that Trump can do with this majority. —DM I have not always had the best track record when it comes to inflation predictions, but this one worked out. It was clear in 2023 that inflation had started to decline rapidly in the wake of the Fed’s interest rate hikes, and that decline continued through 2024, enough so that the Fed was able to start cutting again. By the Fed’s preferred measure — the personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy — prices grew by 2.8 percent from October 2023 through October 2024. That’s an annual rate below 3 points, though not by a whole lot. The Fed’s goal is to get the number down to 2 percent. I find it hard to see prices stabilizing that much, especially if tariffs from the Trump administration cause consumer prices to spike in a one-off event. But we’re clearly doing better than a few years ago. —DM I like to make this prediction mainly to draw our readers’ attention to the scandalous number of Americans killed by our transportation system. In 2023, according to statistics released this year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that number dropped by about 3.6 percent from 2022, to a still-abysmal 40,990, a figure that remains significantly elevated after a Covid-era spike erased more than a decade of progress in reducing car crash deaths. How many is that, exactly? It’s about as many Americans as are killed by guns and more than double the number killed in homicides overall, though it’s far fewer than the numbers of Americans who die from diseases like heart disease and cancer. It’s twice the number of people killed by cars in the European Union, even though the EU has 100 million more people. And the federal car fatality statistics are actually around 10 percent lower than the true number of Americans killed by cars because they exclude some cases, including crashes on private roads and parking lots. If today’s rates remained steady, a rough estimate would suggest that about 1 percent of all Americans would be killed by cars — a stunningly high cost of admission into our car-dependent society. —Marina Bolotnikova I almost always predict that Netanyahu will stay in power, but I made an exception when writing last year’s predictions because the Israeli public was so incredibly furious at him after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Polls were showing that voters wanted him out — by a wide margin. I figured if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, this was it. But even this wasn’t enough. Israel has a parliamentary system, where governments typically form on the basis of coalitions. Netanyahu is really, really good at pacifying his allies in the governing coalition — and they have kept him in power. —Sigal Samuel Climate change is very obviously making its effects felt. This summer was the hottest on record globally. By November, scientists said this year is “virtually certain” to break 2023’s record. They also noted that 2024 marks the first year that Earth is more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than in the pre-industrial period. Sadly, this prediction was a pretty solid bet: You can make it every year and you’ll get it right about 80 percent of the time. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, “This is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.” —SS Modi secured a third straight term as India’s prime minister after this spring’s massive elections, which saw over 640 million voters turn out. It’s an achievement equaled only by India’s founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and one that was about as easy to predict as any outcome in this record-breaking year of global elections. Modi rolled into the elections with an approval rating in the mid-70s, or roughly twice as high as Biden’s popularity around the same time. In a year when incumbent leaders around the world fell in election after election, Modi and his BJP party were a sure thing — so much so that my only regret was not choosing a probability of 99 percent. Even so, this election did not turn out the way many prognosticators expected, myself included. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured a majority in Parliament with 293 seats, but that was well short of the 400 seats the alliance was shooting for. And the BJP itself only won 240 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it had won in the previous election. As a result, the party lost its solo majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time in 10 years. As my colleague Josh Keating wrote, the results were bad for Modi but good for India as a whole, showing that the world’s biggest democracy remains a democracy. An overwhelming victory would have fed into Modi’s growing authoritarian inclinations, which were on display this year as the Indian government attacked critics at home and abroad — including in the US. India was a rare example in 2024 of the people successfully pushing back against a would-be autocrat. —BW There was no courage in the prediction that the massively popular, but term-limited, left-wing President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador (AMLO) would be succeeded by his protégée, Claudia Sheinbaum, a past mayor of Mexico City and climate scientist. The polling, even that early on, showed Sheinbaum with a massive lead over challenger Xóchitl Gálvez, an indication of both Sheinbaum’s talent and the popularity of AMLO and his Morena party. Sheinbaum’s election was historic: She is not only the first woman elected president of Mexico, but the first Jewish person and (to the best of my knowledge) the first scientist. Climate advocates shouldn’t be too sanguine, though. Despite her professional background, Sheinbaum has no interest in shrinking the popular state-owned petroleum sector. —DM After the chaos of 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and 2023, when Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group of mercenaries mutinied and nearly took Moscow, 2024 was a less momentous year in the war. There were major shifts, to be sure: Ukraine seized part of the Kursk region in Russia, giving it Russian land it might be able to trade for Ukrainian territory now under Russian occupation, and North Korea sent troops to the front line, signaling both that Russia has serious allies in the war and that it’s desperate enough to call upon them. But there were no major battlefield breakthroughs, and one of the biggest goals of the Ukrainian military (splitting Russian troops on the Crimean peninsula from troops in the Donbas, the east of Ukraine) did not come to pass. Here is the map of military control I used in last year’s predictions: This is what the map looks like today: If you look carefully, you can see some modest differences between the maps. But overall, they’re nearly identical. The lines of control haven’t moved much in the past year, and with Trump ascending to office and seemingly hostile to extending aid to the Ukrainian military, the future is looking rather grim for Ukrainians defending their sovereignty. —DM I don’t feel too bummed about having erred in my prediction here because the FDA’s rejection came as a surprise to almost everyone involved. When I made this prediction a year ago, patients, therapists, and policymakers alike were anticipating that Lykos Therapeutics, the company trying to get MDMA-assisted therapy approved, would be successful. After all, Lykos had collaborated with the FDA on the trial design, and the latter had signed off on the methodology. But in March, a report raised fresh concerns about the trial design and unreported adverse events. In May and June, more researchers and advocates started to sound the alarm — not just about the psychedelic part of psychedelic-assisted therapy but about the therapy part. Some went so far as to accuse Lykos of being a “therapy cult,” one with a style that could increase risk to patients. Ultimately, the FDA responded to this new information by deciding not to approve Lykos’s application. —SS Did OpenAI release a whole lot of stuff in 2024? It sure did — so much so that the company decided to rebrand 12 days during the holiday season this December as “Shipmas,” releasing everything from ChatGPT Pro (a $200/month plan that includes unlimited access to its top model OpenAI o1) to its video creation model Sora to something called “Santa mode.” The blizzard of product shipping — one matched by competitors like Google and Meta — is a sign of what my colleague Kelsey Piper identified as a shift in AI, away from a single-minded focus on advancing technical progress and toward creating products that people will actually be able to use (and even more importantly, given how expensive frontier AI work is, actually buy). It came as concerns were growing over whether AI was hitting a scaling wall and AI companies were hitting “peak data.” But as I wrote last year, “for the purposes of this prediction, OpenAI will need to release a product called ‘ChatGPT-5’ — no ‘ChatGPT-4.5 Turbo’ or whatever.” Whether because it was running out of data or because it didn’t want to lock itself into ever-escalating model versions, OpenAI did not. I’ll take the L. —BW 2024 was a banner year for SpaceX’s Starship, which saw four test launches. The first in March is a difficult case for my prediction: While the launch itself was successful, the booster stage burned up while hurtling back to the ocean and the ship itself appears to have disintegrated at some point. I predicted that neither stage would “explode,” and it’s hard to know if either did in this test. They certainly didn’t operate the way SpaceX had hoped. Luckily for the company, and for my prediction, its three subsequent launches were all smashing successes. In its June 6 launch, the booster and second stage splashed down, intact, in the Gulf of Mexico and Indian Ocean respectively. The November 19 launch, viewed in person by SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s political ally Donald Trump, got the same results. But the one for the history books came on October 13, when the booster stage returned not to the Gulf of Mexico but to the very same launchpad in Texas from whence it came, where it was caught by two massive mechanical “chopsticks.” Whatever else you think about Musk — and I think a lot of negative things — that was a fairly awe-inspiring achievement, and easily met my prediction that the Starship project would notch major successes this year. —DM I biffed this one pretty bad. For quarters one through three of 2024, Cybertruck sales totaled 28,250 in the US. Anecdotally, they seem to be everywhere in Washington, DC. My rationale was that the extremely unusual design of the truck, complete with a metal rather than painted exterior and a truly massive windshield, would prove challenging to produce at scale. Moreover, Tesla tends to operate with extreme delays, which made me pessimistic that it would meet its timelines for the vehicle. Ultimately, though, it’s a company with a lot of experience building EVs at scale, and the Cybertruck proved to be no exception. I did predict, however, that the nearly 4-foot “monowiper” used on the windshield would break down immediately in inclement weather. Guess what? Tesla had to launch a recall in June over exactly this. —DM The industry leader on self-driving cars, a sister company to Google, entered the year operating in San Francisco and Phoenix but had announced plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin. The latter city has seen testing among Waymo’s own employees but is not yet available to the general public through either the Waymo One app or Uber (which has partnered with Waymo in Phoenix). In Los Angeles, however, driverless taxi rides are now widely available: In March, Waymo started letting Angelenos off its waitlist so they could hail rides, and as of November 12, anyone in LA County can use the service, without any waitlist. That fits my prediction that at least one city would see driverless rides become widely accessible the way they already were in SF and Phoenix. —DM Most antibiotics sold in the US don’t go to hospitals or pharmacies, but to farms. These antibiotics are used to make animals grow faster and keep them alive in overcrowded, unsanitary factory farms, and they’ve given rise to new antibiotic-resistant “superbugs.” When humans fall ill from these superbugs, the typical course of antibiotics may not do the trick to heal them. Former Future Perfect fellow Miranda Dixon-Luinenburg called the growth in antibiotic resistance a “hidden epidemic.” Tracking the amount of antibiotics sold to meat producers is a good proxy for understanding whether we’re backsliding or making progress on this epidemic, and last year, I predicted antibiotic sales for livestock would have increased by 1 percent in 2023. Instead, they went down by 2 percent. It makes sense that they declined because beef production decreased by almost 5 percent, and cattle account for around 40 percent of livestock antibiotic sales, while pork production remained stable. (I predicted 2023 sales because data is delayed by about a year.) I more or less knew this would happen, as the US Department of Agriculture predicted decreased beef production, and they’re usually right about these things. Nevertheless, I ignored common sense and predicted livestock antibiotic sales would increase because they had been on the rise for the previous five years. It’s a mistake to assume that trend lines will always continue, and a lesson I’ll incorporate into future predictions. —Kenny Torrella Sadly, I was right on this one. Oatly’s stock has remained below $1.40 all year, hitting a low of just 61 cents in mid-November (it peaked at nearly $29 per share in the summer of 2021). It’s been a long fall from grace for the company that single-handedly made oat milk cool, moving it from the fringes of the dairy aisle to seemingly every coffee shop menu in America. As I wrote about last year, the company has been beset by manufacturing problems and an onslaught of imitators. And it just hit another roadblock: In early December, a UK judge decided that Oatly can’t use the word “milk” on its products after a UK dairy trade group sued the company over the matter. It’s part of a larger trend of the livestock industry’s effort to restrict how plant-based companies can market their products. In brighter news, the company recently reported its third-quarter revenue was up about 10 percent compared to 2023, with growth in the main regions in which it operates. Despite a flagging stock price, Oatly is down but not out. —KT The US egg industry is still headed toward a cage-free future, but in 2024, it moved slower in that direction than I thought it would. Instead of amounting to 45 percent of the egg supply, cage-free reached 40.3 percent, just a 1.5 percent increase from late 2023. I was confident it would reach 45 percent for three reasons: Since 2019, the share of egg-laying hens raised cage-free had been growing by about 5 percent annually, several states had cage-free laws — banning the sale and production of caged eggs — going into effect in 2024, and many large food companies had committed to a 100 percent cage-free egg supply by 2025. Why was I so off? I likely discounted the impact the bird flu has had on the US egg industry; in 2024, the virus resulted in the mass killing of 39.6 million hens — almost triple that of 2023. I was also overconfident on corporate progress; according to the animal protection group the Humane League, many large food companies are behind on fulfilling their cage-free pledges. Lastly, I probably overestimated the impact of the 2024 state laws in Nevada, Oregon, and Washington; each have small egg industries and relatively small populations. We might see the pace of progress accelerate in 2025: The states implementing cage-free laws next year — Michigan and Colorado — have a slightly bigger combined population than the three states from last year and, more importantly, they have much bigger egg industries. Meanwhile, the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine, will have a number of new cage-free farms going online in summer 2025. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak — combined with the unpredictability of corporate pledges — could shift the trajectory. —KT I hate that this is true, but I was right on this one two times over. More than 40 million chickens and turkeys were killed in the poultry industry’s H5N1 bird flu outbreak. And that’s just this year — since the outbreak began in early 2022, over 120 million have been culled. Most of those are not killed by the avian flu itself; rather, any time there’s a single detection of the disease at a poultry facility, all of the birds are exterminated, often with gruesome methods, like literally overheating them to death with industrial heaters. Three years into this never-ending nightmare, both the factory farm industry and animal advocates are faced with the reality that the bird flu may be here to stay. And one disturbing development we couldn’t have predicted last year: H5N1 is now pervasive in another farm animal species, dairy cows, across the country. Next year, I think this disease will keep surprising us. —MB My reasoning here was based on criminal trials being incredibly unpredictable — so while I thought it was more likely that at least one animal rights activist would be incarcerated than any other single outcome, I put the probability at less than 50 percent. The prediction was mostly a product of recency bias: Barely a month before we made our 2024 predictions, Wayne Hsiung, one of the most prominent US animal rights activists and a co-founder of the group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), was convicted and sentenced to jail for his involvement in actions at two California factory farms. DxE activists have run many similar actions over the last decade, employing a strategy they call “open rescue,” in which they enter factory farms and other places where animals are exploited, remove a few animals and take them to live at a sanctuary, and invite confrontation with the criminal legal system. The first few criminal cases I covered involving the group ended in either dismissals or miraculous acquittals. But Hsiung’s 2023 jail sentence made it feel like the bill was coming due. This year, I suspected that a long-awaited DxE court case, involving the rescue of three beagles from a company that breeds them for animal testing, would end in prison time because I knew it would be harder for the activists to make a legal argument for acquittal than in farm animal cases. But sure enough, the case was dismissed shortly before trial. More DxE trials are scheduled for next year, but now I know better than to try to predict the outcome. —MB This was a big year for Billie! I didn’t predict her new album or extensive world tour, but it’s not rocket science to know that the academy loves her work. With a previous win for the James Bond theme she did back in 2020, the Song of the Year award was a shoo-in. This year’s Future Perfect 50 honoree and superstar is only missing a Tony and an Emmy for that sweet, sweet EGOT status. —Izzie Ramirez I was wrong on this one — it wound up being Jennifer Lopez who looked beautiful in Schiaparelli. Whichever Kardashian-Jenner decided to read this and prove me wrong: noted. But honestly it’s better this way. J. Lo was a co-chair for the event alongside fashion darling Zendaya, so she needed the extra zhuzh. —IR What did I write last year? “The Academy loves biopics, it loves period pieces, and for some reason, it weirdly loves modern films that feature black-and-white scenes.” To no one’s surprise, Oppenheimer ran away with the show at the 96th Academy Awards, winning seven Oscars, including Best Actor for Cillian Murphy, Best Director for Christopher Nolan, and yes, Best Picture. Hot dog! So, since explaining why something we knew would happen happened is pretty boring, I’m going to instead discuss an all-time-great Oppenheimer-related query posted on the subreddit r/NoStupidQuestions: Well, Rafe_Cameron_OBX, is it weird that your boyfriend watches Oppenheimer for as much as 15 hours a week? I think it depends on a few things. Does he obsessively watch and rewatch the bravura scene of the Trinity test? Has he started mumbling something about being “death, destroyer of worlds” in his sleep? (Assuming he sleeps.) You say he always makes time for you, which is great, but does he insist on reciting lines from the Bhagavad Gita when he’s, uh, making time? While I’m hesitant to interfere in another person’s relationship, if the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” I strongly suggest you drop him immediately. I’m worried that if he doesn’t get treatment he may progress to a more advanced stage of Christopher Nolanism and start making you watch Interstellar three to five times a week. —BW You don’t have to be Bill James to know that two-way baseball super-duper megastar Shohei Ohtani had a pretty good year in 2024, his first with the Los Angeles Dodgers, even though an elbow injury kept him from pitching. He hit .310, good for fifth in the majors. He recorded 130 RBIs (second in the majors) and had an OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage, the gold standard hitting stat) of 1.036, also good for second in baseball. He became the first player in major league history to hit more than 50 homers and steal more than 50 bases, becoming the only player in the 50/50 club. On September 19, he had what many people consider the single best offensive game in the 121-year history of Major League Baseball, going 6-for-6 with three home runs, two doubles, 10 RBIs, and two stolen bases. Oh, and he went on to win a championship, too. The one thing Ohtani did not do is the one thing I predicted he would do: lead the major leagues in home runs in 2024. Ohtani mashed 54 taters, which would have been good enough to at least tie for the majors lead in all but three of the past 24 seasons. Unfortunately, very big boy Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees took the crown this season with 58 home runs. I’ll admit, my mistake here was forgetting that as spectacular as Ohtani is across the board in baseball, the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge is really, really good at mashing dingers, at least in the regular season. He flamed out in his championship series against Ohtani’s Dodgers, going 4-for-18 with just one homer and three RBIs, enraging Yankees fans across the country. So even though my prediction failed, I’d say advantage: Ohtani. —BW Correction, January 2, 2025, 10:25 AM ET: An earlier version of this story overstated the number of hens killed in the break flu outbreak in 2024.

Unity Software (NYSE:U) and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) are two of the stocks advancing sharply on the first trading day of 2025. Unity's platform enables computer games to feature "real-time 3D content and experiences," while Rigetti develops quantum-computing products. A close-up of a consumer enjoying the company's games on their mobile device. Unity is climbing 13% after Roaring Kitty, who has inspired multiple meme-stock rallies through his social media contributions, included a depiction of musician Rick James in his post on X. James is known for performing a song called "Unity." Perhaps due to Roaring Kitty's post, the mentions of Unity Software on social media are surging tremendously this morning. Also noteworthy is that on Tuesday night there was a block trade of 1.32 million shares of U stock. Turning to Rigetti, the quantum-computing company's shares are jumping 8.5% after it was reported this morning that State Street, an investment bank, disclosed that it had acquired nearly 310,000 shares of the tech firm's stock in the third quarter. As a result, State Street's stake in Rigetti rose by 12.9% in the third quarter to 2.71 million shares. The bank owned about 1.4% of Rigetti as of the end of Q3, while State Street's position in Rigetti at that time was worth $2.125 million. In the last three months, U stock has gained 21%, while RGTI has zoomed 1,986% higher. While we acknowledge the potential of U, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than U but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Despite a lack of any real news, Unity Software (U) stock went on a tear Thursday morning. It appears to be a result of the latest tweet from Keith Gill, an investor who also goes by “Roaring Kitty.” During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to impose tariffs on certain Chinese imports, such as solar panels. Although economists still debate whether Trump's tariffs will benefit America's economy, domestic solar producers certainly ... Unity Software (U) was a big mover last session on higher-than-average trading volume. The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions might help the stock continue moving higher in the near term. Tesla shares sank Thursday morning after the electric vehicle maker reported fewer deliveries than analysts had expected for the fourth quarter. Despite all sorts of good news for nuclear energy stocks in general in 2024, the year was not a great one for uranium miners like Uranium Energy in particular. In the face of a stock market that gained more than 25%, Uranium Energy stock actually lost value in 2024, and the big reason for this was the falling value of the uranium it produces. Is Uranium Energy stock a buy? In the closing of the recent trading day, Reddit Inc. (RDDT) stood at $165.91, denoting a +1.51% change from the preceding trading day. Hasbro (HAS) closed the most recent trading day at $56.43, moving +0.93% from the previous trading session. Finding strong, market-beating stocks with a positive earnings outlook becomes easier with the Zacks Rank. Mosaic receives 111,012,433 shares of Ma'aden, valued at roughly $1.5 billion, by exchanging its 25% stake in MWSPC. Let's see if it's time to buy Nucor (NUE) stock for a rebound after falling more than 30% over the last year. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped but quickly erased early session gains. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. If the average analyst forecast holds true, that would mean Tesla's annual EV deliveries fell 0.3% from the prior year — making 2024 the first year since 2011 that Tesla EV sales failed to grow, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla shares fell more than 3% on the last day of 2024 as megacap tech stocks lagged, but the EV company's stock was still up more than 60% for the year. Tesla had warned in 2023 that production growth would be "notably lower" in the year ahead, as Pras Subramanian noted in his roundup of Tesla's biggest news in 2024 (you can read that story here). Separately, Tesla made headlines after a Cybertruck exploded outside of a Trump hotel in Las Vegas, prompting an investigation of a potential terrorist attack.

Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Wall Street Is Focusing on These 10 AI Stocks as New Year Begins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a “big problem” for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips. “If you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) …. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they’re not really AI plays, they’re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They’ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you’re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that’s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,” Niles said. Niles said stocks can face a “rough” time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed. “The Fed finally admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that’s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: prykhodov / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 286 Jason Brown from The Brown Report in November explained his bullish thesis for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) during a program on Schwab Network. The analyst believes AWS and ecommerce growth are the two key engines for the stock that can drive its price further. Here is what he said about the stock: “According to analysts, eCommerce is growing 88.5% this year, while retail is growing at about 3.6%. That means people going online are growing at double the pace of those going to a physical location. That’s good news for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). They have the branding and trust where people are willing to put their credit cards in. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Secondly, in August, we sold some of our holdings in two tactical positions in the tail of Montaka’s portfolio – Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Kyndryl Holdings (KD) – to take advantage of a near-20% drawdown in the stock price of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: New Year’s Resolution to Embrace CO2 Emissions and Benefits
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/02/new-years-resolution-to-embrace-co2-emissions-and-benefits/

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change By Vijay Jayaraj Scientific advancement and agricultural technology have revolutionized food production, enabling humanity to feed more readily a ballooning population. And working behind these celebrated innovations is an unacknowledged but indispensable contributor to the world’s growing food security: rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The very molecule that has been wrongly branded as a doomsday gas has been contributing to increasing yields for essential crops like rice, wheat and soybeans. Food Security is Serious Business The 20th century’s Green Revolution demonstrated how scientific intervention – including the use of fertilizers – could dramatically boost crop yields. The late 1960s saw a huge turnaround in yields across the globe, thanks to Norman Borlaug’s high-yielding, drought-adaptive, disease-resistant varieties of food crops. Nations that had suffered severe poverty and famine became agricultural giants within a decade or so. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, two nations that were once pleading for international aid to rescue their people from malnourishment and starvation. Despite being criticized by some, agricultural advancements in the use of fertilizers, pesticides and gene editing have been vital. Without them, feeding our growing global population would be impossible. But they’re not the complete story. Also driving higher crop yields has been an increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere that began in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution accelerated. The rate of increase rose further with global industrialization following World War II. C3-C4 Divide: Understanding the Difference Having an especially efficient photosynthetic pathway are C4 plants, which have a four-carbon sugar molecule produced during photosynthesis. These plants, which include corn and sugarcane, have an evolutionary adaptation from millions of years ago that was a response to an atmosphere relatively low in CO2. Thus, C4 crops are already operating near peak efficiency when it comes to CO2 utilization under suitable environmental conditions like that of the present era. In contrast, C3 plants that developed during a time in the distant past when CO2 levels where many times higher than today’s show dramatic responses to increased atmospheric levels of the gas. C3 plants, named for their three-carbon sugar molecule, have a relatively inefficient photosynthetic process. Their stomata – tiny pores on leaves that allow gaseous exchange – must remain open longer to capture sufficient CO2, which leads to greater water loss through transpiration. Higher ambient CO2 levels allow C3 plants to photosynthesize more efficiently while losing less water. The benefits of elevated CO2 aren’t merely theoretical, as proven in field studies that have confirmed laboratory findings. These studies, conducted in real-world conditions, show consistent yield increases across various C3 crops. Wheat yields increase by 20-30% under elevated CO2 conditions, while rice shows increases of between 15-32%. Soybeans, another crucial C3 crop, exhibit yield increases of up to 46% in some studies. Perhaps nowhere is the CO2 effect more evident than in greenhouse cultivation. Modern greenhouse operators routinely boost productivity by elevating CO2 levels to 800-1,000 parts per million (ppm), which are well above current atmospheric levels of around 420 ppm. The results are striking: tomato yields increase by 40-50%, cucumber production rises by 30-40%, and growth of lettuce and other vegetables accelerates significantly. In addition, it has now come to light that even C4 crops – like corn and sugarcane – can benefit from elevated CO2 under conditions of drought and low soil nitrogen. This is big revelation for tropical Asian countries where sugarcane farmers often struggle with insufficient water for their plants. Further research could reveal that the 21st century’s elevated CO2 levels have been aiding crop production there. Understanding CO2‘s role in crop productivity should inform the policy landscape, where governments and corporate entities like Blackrock and Vanguard have incorrectly promoted the reduction of atmospheric CO2 as a “life-saving” endeavor without understanding basic plant biology. The opposite is true: More atmospheric CO2 is a boon to humanity, and less is bad. We should be grateful for the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide that contribute to greater crop productivity instead of spending billions on foolish projects to remove the gas from the air to store it underground. Such initiatives will do nothing to improve the weather while impoverishing people. Today’s release of carbon dioxide through the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas is reversing a process that sequestered CO2 from the atmosphere millions of years and lowered to less than optimum concentrations the amount of the gas available for plant growth. A resolution worth adopting this New Year would be to reject the coordinated demonization of CO2 by climate scaremongers and to celebrate it for what it is: the gas of life.

Is there anymore a tight and warm embrace of coal and wood borne CO2 – plus anything else you want to burn? Story tip Net zero ‘nudge unit’ accused of Covid scare tactics will push heat pumps on public Behavioural Insights Team receives £100,000 contract from Government as ministers aim to deliver 300,000 extra home upgrades this year https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/01/02/net-zero-nudge-unit-accused-covid-scare-tactics-heat-pumps/ Given that there were less than 40,000 heat pumps of all kinds installed in the UK in 2023 (figures are not yet available for 2024) there is absolutely no chance that an extra 300,000 are going to be installed in 2025. Not in my house… “Modern greenhouse operators routinely boost productivity by elevating CO2 …” In a closed “greenhouse” CO2 has to be added just to replace that consumed by the plants. The elevated term is important. Further, on a windless day, a rapidly growing field, say of corn, will use-up the ambient CO2 and the growth will slow. We should take the captured CO2 from some industrial processes and release it in the fields of growing crops instead of pumping it into underground storage. We could release it into orchards and vineyards. We could submit an application to the USDA for a research funds for these projects. For field work we will need several brand new F-150 Ford pickup trucks. So, are we not at the “tipping point” where we can transition from “Have nothing and be happy” to “Have plenty to eat and be ecstatic” Curious minds want to know. A few days ago Astronomy Picture of the Day APOD put up this statement: “…methane, a greenhouse gas that, if released, could potentially increase the amount of infrared light absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, and so increase the average temperature of the entire planet. In their Asterisk discussion board it was pointed out that CO2 is beneficial to crops around the world which produced this response: Here In any case, a few percent difference in crop production in either direction isn’t really the issue. It’s the collapse of ocean ecosystems, the shift in location of agricultural zones, the rise of sea level, the huge increase in extreme weather events, the loss of species diversity, and many other things that are defining this as a crisis. Hundreds of millions will die, billions will have their lives disrupted, our global economy will collapse and that will almost certainly continue us on our path away from democracy (already beginning, obviously). It’s not going to be pretty for the next generations. This the mindset that the New Year’s resolution is up against. People really do believe that. Hundreds of millions will die, billions will have their lives disrupted, our global economy will collapse…. If we descend into another glacial cycle. The climate crusaders want us to believe that a warmer world with more CO2 constitutes a crisis. The concentration of CH4 in the air is 1.929 ppmv. One cubic meter of air contains ca. 0.0014 g of CH4. The low concentration of CH4 is due to the initiation of its combustion by discharges of lightning. Everyday there are millions of lightning discharges, especially in the tropics (cf. Wiki). A hydrocarbon, CH4 is readily oxidized by ozone which is produced by lighting discharges. CH4 is slightly soluble in cold water. One liter of ice-cold water can contain 35 mls of CH4. That is not very much, but the cold polar waters a quite large. Jet planes with their large engines are flying vacuum cleaners for CH4. Vehicles with ice’s burn up CH4 in the air they use. Wildfires burn up CH4. We really do not have to worry about CH4. Interesting piece, especially on the C3-C4 divide. Nicely encouraging prospective. …. And another.. this could be made into a badge.. Very nice Vijay, wonderful post. Another great Vijay article My first decade of interest in climate was mainly reading scientific studies of CO2 enrichment and plant growth. I have read at least 200 of them. About 95% were about C3 plants because it was believed another 300 ppm of CO2 would not benefit C4 plants like corn much. But the benefits were larger than predicted. This is just my educated guess because there are no conclusive statistics: Global Food Crops C3 plants 70% of food C4 plants 30% of food Average growth increase per +100 ppm CO2 About 10% NOTE: A huge amount of corn (40% globally) is used as food for steers (not cows), pigs and chickens. Biological Impacts of CO2 20 page Summary of a 1079 page document Microsoft Word – _03-26-14_ CCR-IIb SPM.doc I vaguely recall reading an article somewhere that C4 plants are actually capable of reverting back to C3 processes to make better use of the enhanced atmospheric CO2. I much prefer my beef, range fed rather than corn fed. 🙂 The real cost of Net Zero….. Australia The Real Cost of Net Zero: The shocking truth of the renewable energy push Shown below in the graphic is a plot of the of annual average temperatures for Adelaide. The graphic is from the late John Daly’s website available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Do think you could go to the BoM and get the temperature data up to 2023? If the trend continues, this would be additional info that CO2 does not cause warming of air. However, it is likely that original weather station has been moved so it would not be possible to complete the plot. While this is a good article. it considerabl;y understates the benefits of CO2. While the harms fail to manifest, the benefits increase linearly to concentration levels well above anything likely to occur. These benefits are massive. Currently most every every crop on the planet grows 12% to 20% more food (conservative estimate) then it would if the atmospheric CO2 level suddenly dropped from 420 PPM to pre-industrial 280 PPM. (280 PPM CO2 is near starvation levels. If CO2 concentration had moved 125 PPM in the opposite direction to only 155 PPM concentration, almost everybody on the planet would starve, and almost all bio-life would cease.) Also, this CO2 caused increased production of bio-life, delivers another stupendous benefit, in that zero increase in water or land acreage is required. Additionally CO2 makes crops more drought, heat, and frost resistant – geographically expanding growing zones and growing seasons! Indeed, if we went to 280 PPM tomorrow, WWIII would happen within weeks. Also there are far more benefits to C4 plants then listed. Please begin here, http://www.co2science.org//subject/c/c4plantbiom.php and there are many more then the multiple links here. …….280 PPM tomorrow, WWIII would happen within weeks. WWWIII is much more likely to result from the brain chemistry of a power crazed politician than from atmospheric chemistry. They are orthogonal. However a 20 percent global drop in food production would cause very rapid global conflict. Story tip: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352938524002416 Add this: Highlights As usual, Vijay’s CO2 essay is excellent. I will reference it in my articles Dutch and Belgium consortia own about 50% of all food supermarkets in the eastern US, which provides plenty of shelf space for display of European farm products, at the expense of US farmers, all as part of our full of holes trade agreements. What is not generally known, Dutch greenhouse owners in Quebec, Canada, receive low cost electricity and gas to provide lighting and CO2 and heat in the winter, during which they grow blueberries, cucumbers, parsnips, tomatoes, etc, which I buy in the Hanneford market, in West Lebanon, NH, owned by a Belgium consortium. Most supermarket chains now charge wholesalers for “shelf space” ….so maybe the US farmers need to get into the kickback game….Canadians, on the other hand value their quota system which insulates their farmers from going bankrupt every time the US has a production bubble. Trump will soon have a tariff system You sell to us, only if you buy from us, to maintain balanced reciprocal trade, otherwise a tariff high enough until you do. The Europeans will go ape shit, hate Trump more, but will have to suck it up. They refuse to buy from us. I personally despise this “hint dropping” in articles, like “…increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere that began in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution accelerated. The rate of increase rose further with global industrialization following World War II.” This is only reinforcing the belief, that we, the humans are the cause of this “dangerous” increase in CO2 in the atmosphere in less informed, often indoctrinated individuals. There are numerous published studies, some even in this blog, which show convincingly, that burning of fossil fuels is NOT the cause of CO2 increase, and that CO2 is NOT controlling the temperature of the planet. After WWII the NH temperature dropped by at least 0.5C, while beneficial CO2 continued to climb. Of course that period, called the Global COOLING Scare, has now been erased from the temperature records. Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.

Stocks edged higher on Thursday to kick off the first day of trading of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline traders returned from Wednesday's holiday shutdown. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." But the decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years of over-20% gains in a row — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks rose modestly, with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all climbing as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. Meanwhile, Alibaba's (BABA, 9988.HK) stock tipped lower as markets absorbed news the Chinese e-commerce giant will sell its shares in hypermarket chain Sun Art (SURRY, 6808.HK) at a steep discount. Tesla (TSLA) shares slid more than 6% after the release of the company's fourth quarter delivery data by the EV maker.

Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. If the average analyst forecast holds true, that would mean Tesla's annual EV deliveries fell 0.3% from the prior year — making 2024 the first year since 2011 that Tesla EV sales failed to grow, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla shares fell more than 3% on the last day of 2024 as megacap tech stocks lagged, but the EV company's stock was still up more than 60% for the year.

Title: Why it seems like all of America’s chains are closing | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The retail store apocalypse stormed back in 2024. Major US retailers announced more than 7,300 store closures last year, up 57% from 2023, according to Coresight Research. That’s the highest annual number of closed stores since 2020, when the pandemic led to mass disruption of businesses across the country. Some of the most recognizable chains in America left strip malls and shuttered across city street corners. Family Dollar closed 718 stores. CVS and Walgreens closed more than 1,000 stores combined. Big Lots closed nearly 600. LL Flooring disappeared for good, and Party City’s liquidation is under way. The Container Store filed for bankruptcy and may be forced to close some of its 100 stores. Restaurant chains also shrank last year. Institutions like Red Lobster and TGI Fridays filed for bankruptcy and Denny’s and Applebee’s announced major closings. There’s no single reason why all of these chains closed last year. But they have a few factors in common: They each were hurt by the highest inflation in 40 years and faced competition from bigger and better-positioned rivals. Many also made strategic mistakes like overexpanding or were slow to pivot to online shopping. “Price-sensitive consumers are looking for the best prices and finding them online,” said Deborah Weinswig, chief executive at Coresight Research. “They have also lost patience with stores that are hard to shop, have out-of-stock items all the time, poor customer service and other issues, and they’re deciding to shop elsewhere.” Closures accelerated because the retail sector’s 2020-2022 sugar high ran out. In the early years of the pandemic, consumers snapped up new couches, televisions and clothing. But companies raised prices higher than many consumers could afford and interest rates soared, making it more expensive to borrow money for big-ticket items or to get a mortgage or a car loan. Consumers reached their breaking point and stopped buying items they didn’t absolutely need, hurting these retailers. Competition from juggernauts like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and Temu also squeezed mid-sized chains like Family Dollar and Big Lots. Bigger chains can buy larger quantities of goods at a steeper discount than smaller players, and they can put vast sums of money into technology and store improvements that even medium-sized retailers can’t afford. The rise in store closures this year harkens back to the days prior to the pandemic, when retailers were closing thousands of stores a year as online shopping grew rapidly. Online sales grew from roughly 6% of all retail sales in 2014 to 12% by the beginning of 2020. This year, online retail made up around 16% of total sales. In 2017 and 2018, retailers closed a combined 13,400 stores, according to Coresight. In 2019 alone, retailers closed a record 9,800 stores. Payless, Gymboree, Charlotte Russe and Shopko all filed for bankruptcy that year. The beginning of the pandemic in 2020 flushed out some of the remaining weakest chains like Sears, JCPenney, Pier 1 and others that filed for bankruptcy and closed stores. Around 9,700 stores closed in 2020, according to Coresight. Retailers that made it through got a boost in 2021 and 2022 from extra federal stimulus payments and “revenge spending” among consumers eager to shop after being stuck at home. But this turned out to be a blip, rather than a permanent improvement. Chains that were struggling before the pandemic are once again faltering as high interest rates drive up debt payments and price hikes weigh on many consumers. Inflation is getting back to normal, but prices overall are still up around 20% from 2020. Surging rates mean people are paying more for their cars, their homes and their credit cards every month, so there’s less money to go around for other things — even as Americans’ paychecks got fatter this year. The Container Store is a prime example of a company falling back to earth after surging post-pandemic. It boomed in 2021, when consumers stuck inside their homes at the peak of the pandemic drove record sales and profit at the company. But the Container Store proved vulnerable to changes in the housing market. Mortgage rates hit two-decade highs near 8% last year and are still hovering close to 7%. High interest rates have kept many people from buying or selling their homes, and the frozen housing market has spilled over to hurt the Container Store. Consumers hunting for bargains and dialing back discretionary purchases after years of companies raising prices also pressured the Container Store. Its core middle-income shoppers are looking for discounts and turned their backs on the store’s big profit engines, including consultations and premium services. Even more affluent shoppers are curtailing their spending and switching to chains that offer lower-priced products. The Container Store filed for bankruptcy days before Christmas. Smaller discount retailers that cater to lower and middle-income shoppers were also squeezed out. Family Dollar hit trouble as its core low-income customers struggled to afford basic necessities and dialed back their spending or switched to Walmart — where they were already buying all the rest of their stuff, including groceries (Walmart is America’s largest food seller). Other discount chains faced similar challenges: Big Lots filed for bankruptcy in September and has closed hundreds of stores. The company reached a last-minute agreement to keep its remaining 900 stores open. 99 Cents Only went out of business permanently and closed 371 stores. Drug store chains are also shrinking. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid have announced more than closures this year combined, according to Coresight. These chains overexpanded during the 1990s and 2000s to drive out competitors and draw more customers, but they weren’t able to foresee vastly lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs on the horizon; nor that Amazon, Walmart and others would chip away at the snacks and household staple sales that the front end of their stores relied on. “Retailers who were either financially flawed, undifferentiated or who forgot how to serve customers struggled,” said Greg Portell, a senior partner at consulting firm Kearney. Many of these trends will continue in 2025, especially if President-elect Donald Trump implements sweeping tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariffs on goods coming from China. Tariffs are taxes placed on imported goods designed to protect domestic manufacturers. Companies that import products pay the taxes and typically pass on the extra cost to customers in the form of higher prices. “Retailers should expect continued degradation of the middle market,” said Portell. It’s not the end of retail as we know it, however. Successful chains will be suitors for vacant retail and restaurant space. Major chains announced nearly 6,000 store openings last year, a 6.5% increase from 2023. Many companies opening stores are targeting bargain hunters. Related article Chili’s is America’s unlikeliest restaurant comeback story German discount grocer Aldi announced plans last year to open 126 new stores nationwide in a larger $9 billion expansion strategy to reach shoppers looking for cheap groceries. Discount clothing stores like TJ Maxx, Burlington and Ross Stores are growing. These chains have pressured department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s in recent years by offering designer brands for lower prices. TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, announced 99 store openings last year. Burlington announced 140 openings. And Ross opened 89. Companies and economists warn that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to slap tariffs on all US imports will cause havoc in supply chains and raise prices for customers. But TJX has said it believes that Trump’s planned tariffs will create more opportunities for the company to scoop up cheap designer goods as companies race to bring in products early to avoid tariffs. TJX said that the “chaos” Trump’s tariffs may bring to the retail industry plays right into its business model. “Manufacturers could bring in goods early,” TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said on an earnings call with analysts in November. “That could create even additional availability of goods at advantageous prices for us.” Other retailers have also made unlikely comebacks and are opening stores again. Barnes & Noble opened 60 stores last year as consumers showed affinity for buying books from physical bookstores. J.Crew, which filed for bankruptcy in 2020, opened 34 stores last year and brought back its catalog. J. Crew has tapped into Millennials’ nostalgia for the brand and attracted younger Gen Z shoppers. So the retail apocalypse may be back on — but smart brands have figured out how to make brick and mortar cool again.

January 02, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Jan. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Bank Of America Expects Its “Sector Top Pick” NVIDIA To Officially Announce Its Entry In The AI PC Market At The Upcoming CES

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA stole the proverbial show in 2024, sometimes going so far as to cushion the entire market via the relentless rise in its market capitalization. Now, it seems that the GPU maker is on course to repeat the stellar notes of its 2024 performance, as per the tidbits that can be gleaned from the latest investment note penned by Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya. To wit, while conceding that the broader overtones of NVIDIA's keynote address at the upcoming CES are already known, Arya asserts that the tradeshow still remains a positive catalyst for the GPU manufacturer's shares: "While the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA’s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets." At the upcoming CES tradeshow, Arya expects NVIDIA to provide critical updates on its overarching robotics strategy and the Jetson Thor platform for humanoid robots, which aligns with the emerging theme around "physical AI." The BofA analyst also expects NVIDIA to launch RTX 50xx - the PC gaming variants of its Blackwell GPUs that are expected to boast of "enhanced 'neural rendering' and faster GDDR7 memory." Moreover, Arya expects NVIDIA to provide another update on its data center/AI GPU lineup, "incl. current-gen Blackwell (GB200, B200), 2H upgraded variants (GB300, B300 – more memory (288GB using 12 stack High HBM 3E) for more accurate AI inference) and teaser on next-gen Rubin (CY26E)." Finally, and perhaps most critically, Arya is looking for NVIDIA's official entry in the "AI PC [market] likely via partnership or (small) chance of standalone PC CPU." This aligns with a separate note recently penned by Truist Securities analyst Will Stein, wherein he announced: "We believe NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM." Coming back, in light of the anticipated developments at the CES, Arya has reiterated a 'Buy' rating on NVIDIA shares with a $190 stock price target: "Reiterate Buy on our sector top pick, Nvidia , ahead of CES tradeshow that starts Jan-6 with keynote and other events featuring NVDA CEO." For reference, NVIDIA is currently trading at the $135 price handle in today's pre-market trading. This corresponds to a ~40 percent upside potential relative to Arya's stated target price for the GPU manufacturer's shares. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Weight loss drugs are changing the game, Eli Lilly exec says — but many still can't get them
URL: https://qz.com/zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-eli-lilly-patrik-jonsson-1851721253
Time Published: 2025-01-02T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Obesity is a major global health crisis, especially in the United States, but newer weight-loss drugs like Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.64%) Zepbound could offer a long-awaited solution — if they become more accessible. Worldwide, obesity rates among adults have more than doubled since 1990, with over 1 billion people — one in eight globally — classified as obese in 2022, according to the World Health Organization. In the U.S., the numbers are even starker with 40% of American adults being considered obese. It’s no wonder then that a newer class of highly-effective weight-loss drugs, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin treatments have taken the country by storm. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS+0.65%) project that the global market for these weight-loss drugs could reach $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, adoption is expected to grow to 31.5 million people — approximately 9% of the population — by 2035. The growing use of these drugs could be a “game changer” for long-term healthcare outcomes and costs, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz in an interview. However, due to their high-price and lack of widespread insurance coverage, these medications remain inaccessible to many patients. “Obesity is a chronic disease with more than 200 downstream indications,” Jonsson said. “I can’t think of any other chronic disease that is not covered in insurance plans outside of obesity.” Jonsson began leading the company’s most lucrative division this January. He now oversees Eli Lilly’s pipeline of incretin medications, including its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound. Zepbound belongs to the incretin class medications, which was made popular by Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment. These drugs mimic hormones that reduce appetite and regulate blood sugar. Demand for these medications have transformed Novo Nordisk (NVO+0.30%) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Now, recent studies and clinical trials have found that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss, potentially paving the way for broader insurance coverage and thus wider-access. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly published results of a study that found that the drug behind Zepbound was found to help nearly eliminate the risk of diabetes for adults who are pre-diabetic and are overweight or obese. The drug was tested on over 1,000 adults over the course of three years who had pre-diabetes and were overweight or obese. Patients who took weekly doses of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 94%, compared to patients who were on a placebo. “What does it mean if we prevent diabetes or at a minimum delay the onset of action with three, five, ten years? The impact on humanity is significant,” Jonsson said of the potential implications of the study. Additionally, the company announced results of trials that showed the drug could help with other conditions like heart failure. Its competitor Novo Nordisk has also explored additional medical uses for its incretin medications, such as treating chronic kidney disease. Jonsson said this growing bank of evidence “underscores the value of treating obesity.” This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s weight-loss drug Wegovy for reducing the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. As a result, Medicare began covering the drug. Medicare is currently only allowed to cover these medications for weight loss if they are prescribed to treat a second condition as well. And in December, the FDA approved Zepbound as the first prescription drug to help alleviate moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for adults with obesity, opening the door for Medicare to cover the drug. President Joe Biden is now trying to expand access to pricey blockbuster drugs in his final months in office. The Biden-Harris administration proposed a new rule on in November that would expand coverage of the anti-obesity medications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The proposal must still undergo the formal rule-making process, which could take several months, and would require endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump to be implemented. This complicates the issue since Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as his choice to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Kennedy has previously come out more strongly against the growing use of these drugs. Instead, he has repeatedly promoted healthy eating as a solution to the country’s obesity epidemic. Jonsson rejected the notion that diet and exercise alone could solve the obesity crisis. “In all the clinical trials, not just for Lilly, but I think for most of our competitors as well, there is a placebo arm that includes diet and exercise,” Jonsson said. “So, diet and exercise are regularly checked in placebo-controlled trials. And it’s not sufficient. It’s never even close to making a significant difference.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mr Price Group Limited (JSE:MRP) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 54%

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Mr Price Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions 50% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business A look at the shareholders of Mr Price Group Limited (JSE:MRP) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Mr Price Group. View our latest analysis for Mr Price Group Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. Mr Price Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mr Price Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Mr Price Group is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Public Investment Corporation Limited is the largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, Ninety One UK Limited and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Mark Blair directly holds 0.5% of the total shares outstanding. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Mr Price Group Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own R596m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in Mr Price Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mr Price Group better, we need to consider many other factors. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.

Title: Five Top Tech Stocks Of 2024: Year In Review
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2025/01/01/five-top-tech-stocks-of-2024-year-in-review/
Time Published: 2025-01-01T23:21:45Z
Full Content:
The Nasdaq 100 capped off 2024 with a return of 24.9%, building upon 2023’s 53.8% return (its best year since 1999). Since the start of 2023, the Nasdaq 100 has nearly doubled with stellar returns of 84.5%, its second highest two year performance since 1998 and 1999’s 274.2% rise. This year, the Nasdaq had countless winners and strong repeat performances from AI leaders like Nvidia, but 5 stocks took the market by surprise with significant outperformance relative to the broader indices. I think it’s important to pause and draw some parallels around the stocks that performed well in 2024 to form an opinion on what might perform well in 2025, as many of the year’s top performers shared similar fundamental improvements or had similar thematic tailwinds such as AI, nuclear and quantum computing. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 21: Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock ... [+] Exchange (NYSE) while ringing a bell on the floor setting the share price at $47 in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024 in New York City. The social media platform Reddit had priced its IPO in the range of $31 to $34 per share on Wednesday. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Below, I review five of the top stocks of 2024, selected based on their price action, fundamentals and presence withing leading tech themes. Choosing a top 5 means many great stocks were left off this list, yet this sample helps to form conclusions around how 2024 shaped up versus years past, centered around leading, core thematic opportunities. Read about our Top 5 Stocks from 2023 here and our Top 5 Stocks from 2022 here – many of which went on to lead the following years. AppLovin was one of the Nasdaq’s best performers, up 735%and joining the Nasdaq 100 on a special rebalance in November. From the start of 2024, AppLovin rose from a mere $13 billion valuation to $111 billion, peaking above $135 billion in early December – the stock has done the unthinkable this year, awakening a low-growth mobile gaming ads industry with an AI engine that is showing demonstrable results. This meteoric rise stems from APP’s AXON 2.0 AI advertising engine, which has driven significant revenue acceleration and massive fundamental improvements to margins and cash flow. AppLovin has reported four consecutive quarters with revenue growth above 30% YoY, a major acceleration from late 2022 and late 2023 where three of four quarters saw declining revenues. Management expressed confidence in maintaining 20% to 30% YoY growth for the foreseeable future due to the efficiencies of AXON’s self-learning and catalysts from web-based e-commerce expansion. AppLovin has reported four consecutive quarters with revenue growth above 30% YoY, a major ... [+] acceleration from late 2022 and late 2023. Not only has revenue accelerated substantially, but AppLovin’s margins have more than doubled further down the income statement. GAAP gross margin expanded more than 8 points to 77.5% in Q3, while operating margin rose more than 13 points to 44.6%. Taking a look annually, AppLovin is on track to potentially double its operating margin to ~38% from 19.7% in FY23. Additionally, net margin nearly tripled to 36% in Q3 on a GAAP basis, up from 13% a year ago. EPS rose 317% YoY to $1.25, with YTD EPS reaching $2.81, up 462% YoY. AppLovin is on track to potentially double its operating margin to ~38% from 19.7% in FY23. AppLovin’s near-flawless execution has also translated to strong cash flow generation, with operating cash flow margin doubling, rising from 23% a year ago to 46% in Q3. Free cash flow margin followed, reaching 45.5%, up from 22% a year ago. This kind of operating leverage while maintaining revenue growth rates in the 30% range is quite rare indeed, separating AppLovin from a majority of its ad-tech and software peers. Analysts are excited to see what the company’s expansion to e-commerce can contribute to growth and a path to $6+ in EPS next year from AppLovin’s very strong margin profile. Palantir joins this Top 5 list for a second-year running, with shares rising 356%. My firm’s free stock newsletter previously pointed out that Palantir was “one of the rare few that sees AI drive both real returns for its business and real value for its customers,” as it continues to crush its software competitors in AI-related growth. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has driven a significant revenue re-acceleration following its launch, with profitability also expanding – a rare combination for growth software stocks. Palantir has capitalized on the AI software opportunity at hand via AIP’s unique value proposition, its scalability and versatility. November and December’s partnership announcements alone help demonstrate the versatility of Palantir’s platform, spanning numerous different industries from autonomous drone navigation to AI models for defense tech to more government program wins. Palantir benefits from the best of both worlds in both government contracts and AI exposure, as enterprise adoption of AI builds. For a deeper look at AIP and how it has been transforming Palantir and driving revenue growth higher, read This Stock Is Crushing Salesforce, MongoDB And Snowflake In AI Revenue. Palantir’s 2024 was characterized by strong underlying AI momentum, with Q3 seeing revenue growth reach 30%, more than 10 points faster than when it entered the year and nearly 5 points above guidance for 25.2% growth. AIP has aided this revenue acceleration story by driving significant growth in Palantir’s US commercial segment, with the past two quarters seeing growth there above 50% YoY. Palantir’s 2024 was characterized by strong underlying AI momentum, with Q3 seeing revenue growth ... [+] reach 30%, more than 10 points faster than when it entered the year. Similar to AppLovin, these AI growth tailwinds are not just driving revenue, but also aiding operating margin expansion and EPS growth. GAAP operating margin was 16% for the second quarter in a row, up 9 points from last year, while adjusted operating margin is approaching 40% and has been >30% for four quarters in a row. Cash flow margins have been strong — operating cash flow was nearly $420 million, or a 58% margin, while adjusted free cash flow was $435 million, a 60% margin in Q3, up from the low-20% range in the first half of 2024. Palantir is targeting adjusted FCF of $1 billion-plus this year, or ~36% of revenue. Fundamentally, to have revenue growth around 30%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and adjusted operating margin nearing 40% is impressive, to say the least. Palantir’s returns this year reflect that fundamental strength from AI-driven growth as well as optimism about its AI growth prospects for next year. Quantum computing stocks have been on a tear to end the year, with a handful of names seeing returns of more than 2,000% over the past three months. IonQ has risen 244% on surging enthusiasm for the quantum computing sector and revenue reaccelerating 40 percentage points over the past three quarters. IonQ reported $12.4 million in revenue in Q3, with revenue growth of 102% YoY, following on 106% YoY growth in Q2. This has accelerated 42 points from 60% YoY growth in Q4, as IonQ is starting to quickly scale revenues as it has been consistently delivering on its technical roadmap ahead of schedule. IonQ also slightly raised its full year revenue guidance to $40.5 million at midpoint, for growth of 84% YoY. As it is still in its scaling phase, IonQ is by no means profitable or close to profitability, with analysts not expecting the quantum computing firm to break into profitability until well after 2027. However, revenue is currently expected to grow at a ~95% CAGR through 2027, from $22 million last year to an estimated $315 million. IonQ's revenue is currently expected to grow at a ~95% CAGR through 2027, from $22 million last year ... [+] to an estimated $315 million. This positioning in a leading theme among investors in the second half of 2024, as well as consistent execution ahead of schedule with revenue growth forecast to rise at a nearly triple digit CAGR through 2027 has landed IonQ a spot on this list. Despite not even trading for the entire year with its IPO in March, Reddit has returned a remarkable 224% from its first day close of $50.44. The social media and online community platform reported a blowout beat and raise in Q3, with investors eyeing some AI training data opportunities ($60M/year deal with Google) on top of strong advertising growth. Q3 revenue rose 68% YoY to $348 million, a 14 point acceleration from 54% YoY growth in Q2 and up 20 points from 48% YoY growth in Q1. Advertising revenue growth accelerated 15 points sequentially, rising 56% YoY to $315 million. Q4’s guide for $385 million to $400 million in revenue came in well above the $361 million consensus estimate, pointing to growth of 57% YoY. The market is expecting another blowout in Q4, with analysts already projecting $403 million in revenue, above the high end of management’s guided range. Reddit's Q3 revenue rose 68% YoY to $348 million, a 14 point acceleration from 54% YoY growth in Q2 ... [+] and up 20 points from 48% YoY growth in Q1 Reddit is demonstrating significant operating leverage, as it surprised the Street by reporting GAAP net income in the high single-digit percents in the quarter. GAAP operating expenses rose 53% YoY, less than that 68% YoY revenue growth, pushing GAAP operating margin to 8.6%, up from (3.4%) a year ago and (3.7%) in Q2. Cash flow generation has improved, with Reddit generating $71.6 million in operating cash flow and $70.3 million in free cash flow in Q3, or margins of ~20%. This doubled from ~10% cash flow margins in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA has increased more than 9x from the start of the year, at $94.4 million in Q3, a 27% margin, up from just $10.0 million in Q1. Reddit excites the market due to its fundamentals — a 90% gross margin business quickly shifting to GAAP profitability on rapid quarterly revenue growth. This combination hints at potentially strong EPS growth, should it scale from the single-digit net margin range of 8.6% in Q3, to the double-digit range in short time. Though Nvidia arguably deserves a spot on this Top 5 list with a 114% gain following Hopper’s breakout 2023, with data center revenue continuing to beat estimates by $1 billion each quarter, I think it’s time to highlight an Nvidia supplier and ASICs beneficiary – Astera Labs. Astera returned 179% in Q4 for a total YTD gain of 128%, with the company showing multiple growth opportunities and a push for profitability despite still solidly being in its hypergrowth phase. Astera is a major supplier to Nvidia’s PCIe-enabled GPUs with PCIe5 retimers and components, and its upcoming Scorpio fabric switches built on its lead in PCIe5. Management expects the new product to “exceed 10% of revenues in 2025” with “good momentum going into 2026” as it unlocks a $12 billion TAM by 2028. Astera reported record revenue of $113.1 million in Q3, up 47% QoQ and 206% YoY, beating estimates by 16.1%. Management guided for $126 million to $130 million in revenue in Q4, well ahead of the $108 million consensus estimate and representing YoY growth of 153%, its fifth consecutive triple-digit growth rate. Astera Labs reported 206% YoY revenue growth in Q3 and guided for 153% YoY growth in Q4, its fifth ... [+] consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. Even with revenue growth expected to be triple-digits for at least the next two quarters, management forecast for GAAP net income in Q4, though at a razor thin margin. GAAP operating margin is moving towards positive territory, from (7.9%) in Q3 to (4.3%) at midpoint of Q4’s guide. Adjusted operating margin expanded significantly to above 32% in Q3, up from 2% a year ago, while adjusted net margin improved 35.6% compared to (-1.1%) last year. Astera was one of a handful of AI-exposed semiconductors to see dazzling returns this year, as AI semiconductors remained investor favorites throughout the year. Astera also shared key similarities to the rest of this list: adjusted margins showing strong expansion, high cash flow margins (56% operating cash flow margin in Q3), and AI-related rapid revenue growth. For a more detailed look at Astera’s product lines, Blackwell and ASICs opportunities and its AI-driven TAM growth, read more here. If there’s one major takeaway from this selection of 2024’s top tech stocks, it’s that being at the top comes with quite the price tag and premium. All five of these stocks trade at quite high multiples, headlined by IonQ at 230x forward revenue and Palantir at a 2021-esque 63x forward revenue and 32x 2027 revenue. Astera Labs trades at 53x forward revenue, while AppLovin and Reddit are not quite as high, at 24x and 22x respectively. However, these revenue multiples are all 130% to 500% higher than they were six months ago, highlighting just how quickly these five have gotten more expensive as they’ve rallied. All five of these stocks trade at quite high multiples, headlined by IonQ at 230x forward revenue ... [+] and Palantir at a 2021-esque 63x forward revenue and 32x 2027 revenue. Looking back at 2024 can be important as it often provides clues for tech investors as the new year begins. Winners have kept winning, from Nvidia to the five discussed here, and that is one reason I like to reflect on the clear winners from the previous year. These five stocks above highlighted similarities among winning tech stocks in 2024 – presence and prevalence in leading themes such as AI and quantum computing, strong revenue acceleration (and rapid growth), and operating leverage driving margin expansion. For 2025, the I/O Fund has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing this research and buy zones with premium members.

Returns from the tech-focused Nasdaq have frequently been impressive. Photo / Getty Images If you invested in the stock market in 2024, chances are you came out pretty well. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite index rose to record highs, as investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence fueled a massive bull run, and investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s shift to lower interest rates. Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans also benefited big, with Fidelity Investments reporting that account balances reached their highest averages on record. The stock market soared despite Americans’ widespread discontent with the economy, highlighting a disconnect between the experiences of many US households and the performance of their investments. US markets outperformed those in Europe and Asia: The S&P 500 gained 23% this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 13%, and the STOXX Europe 600 moved up 6%, earlier this week. The strong performance also came amid expectations of an economic slowdown in 2024. “There were real concerns over the summer about whether we were once again heading for a hard landing and/or a recession,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. But in a way, those fears came at a good time, Bespoke Investment co-founder Paul Hickey said, because it helped push the Fed to ease monetary policy. “It almost panicked the Fed into cutting 50 basis points at its annual meeting” in September, Hickey said. Markets rallied further late in 2024, fuelled by what analysts say was exuberance over the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term. The president-elect punctuated the “Trump trade” when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in December, though stocks fell days later on signals that the Fed, rather than cutting interest rates further, planned to leave them at their current level for longer than many observers had expected. Here are the highlights of a momentous year in stocks. The S&P 500′s record gains in the first half of 2024 were driven by seven tech stocks that significantly outperformed the other companies on the index. The “Magnificent Seven” - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla - have an outsize effect on the S&P 500 because the index is weighted by market capitalisation, a shorthand for companies’ size and value. The rest of the index started to catch up in the latter half of the year, a rally that showed “it’s not just seven companies driving the entire economy,” Hickey said. But the technology and AI sectors continued to dominate investors’ attention. And no stock captured their enthusiasm like AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose earnings calls have inspired rapturous takes from traders and casual investors alike. “Every bull market has a theme, and the theme of this bull market has been AI,” Hickey said. Chris Rupkey, with Fwdbonds, said Nvidia’s juggernaut status has made it something of a bellwether for the broader market. “Follow the bouncing ball of Nvidia,” he said in August. “Nvidia down, sell everything. Nvidia up, buy it all.” Nvidia’s growth has slowed in recent months and its stock has taken temporary hits after strong earnings reports, as analysts set exceedingly hard-to-meet expectations and some raise concerns that rampant spending on AI is creating a financial bubble. But some analysts say Nvidia will have staying power and catalyse further investment in AI. “This is the fourth industrial revolution playing out across tech,” said Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. “It’s led by Mag 7, but now software and cybersecurity players are getting in.” US stocks dipped, then surged, after the Fed cut interest rates by a half-percentage point in September, easing monetary policy for the first time since March 2020 amid signs that inflation was moderating. That, in turn, boosted consumer sentiment and took the edge off interest rates. “A funny thing kind of happened on the way to the recession and or economic slowdown that we all anticipated, which is basically that the [middle- and high-income] consumer just never flinched,” Samana said. US stocks jumped on the news that Trump would return to the White House after campaigning on promises to slash regulations. Companies expected to benefit under the Trump administration - such as private prison company Geo Group and Tesla, which is led by Trump adviser Elon Musk - leaped while renewable energy and pharmaceutical stocks sank in the immediate aftermath. But Hickey said the conventional wisdom about winners and losers in the market doesn’t always pan out when it comes to politics. “Coming into the first Trump administration, you would have thought the energy sector would have done well,” he said. “It was the worst performing sector.” Looking ahead, Hickey expects the industrial sector will perform well in 2025, especially if loosened regulations help lingering construction projects break ground - such as renewable energy proposals green-lit by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “Whether it was Trump or Biden that was elected president, the overall trend in the economy is to bring more production back to the United States,” Hickey said. The biggest wild card going into 2025 is tariffs, said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar. Trump has said he intends to impose a blanket tariffs on imports, but it’s unclear what countries or sectors would be covered and how much of the promise is campaign rhetoric. Bitcoin had a massive year - and that was especially reflected in the share price of MicroStrategy, a business software company that has snapped up several billions of dollars in bitcoin. The company’s stock is up more than 340% year to date, with much of those gains coming after the presidential election. Bitcoin itself began the year with a massive boost, as the Securities and Exchange Commission approved exchange-traded funds tied to the price of bitcoin. In the following months, bitcoin’s price nearly doubled, from around US$40,000 per coin in January to about US$73,000 per coin in March. The price largely held steady until Trump was elected to a second term. After the November election, bitcoin’s price soared and at one point surpassed US$100,000 per coin, a milestone cheered by the cryptocurrency community. The first and most valuable cryptocurrency is up more than 120%. . While Magnificent Seven stocks received big publicity this year, a few lesser-known companies dwarfed their gains - at least when it came to growth. Sezzle, a “buy now, pay later” company, is up more than 1000% on the year, with much of its gains coming after the November election, though some of those gains were wiped out in December when an activist short-selling firm released a report accusing the company of risky lending practices. Shares in NuScale Power, a nuclear power company focused on small modular reactors, is up more than 450% on the year. The rise reflects investor excitement over the transition to low-carbon energy sources, particularly new technologies such as NuScale’s designs. AppLovin, a mobile app development and marketing company, also had a banner year on Wall Street, with the companies’ shares up more than 700% on the year. Analysts say the company has been able to wield AI to more effectively market apps. It was a soft start to the year on worries about higher bond rates.

Title: Wishes for 2025 on the Edge of the Abyss

Full Content:
Welcome to the new year! Remember last year when I said things were going to be bad in 2024? Probably not, but I have the link here. In hindsight, I didn’t really allow for how much of that would spill into 2025. Also, a year ago I really meant being constantly bombarded by all the election nonsense. I kind of thought the country would make a better choice after that. I thought it would be temporary nonsense. But no, we have chosen chaos. We have chosen a game show reality TV government because… well, we’re dumb… or willfully ignorant… or masters of self-deception. I mean sure, some out there clearly thought sowing the wind sounded really cool and supported sowing in an unabashed, full throated way, pouring billions of dollars into the “pro-sow” candidates. And now we will spend our time reaping the whirlwind thanks in part to them. But the result was mostly due to people being incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. So shall it be, the people have spoken. The Year is 2025 So here we are on the first day of 2025 and… do I really want to do predictions? On the one hand, there is a bit of a tradition to maintain at this point. I mean, look at this record: That is a 17 year streak and I am not about to break that because the world is going to shit… or at least more so than usual. On the other hand, you can see that I don’t have to do predictions every year. I mean, if you dig into those years when it is something like “Questions,” they really could be seen as predictions. But they are also different in tone and a bit liberating because you don’t have to focus on a goal, just a possible topic. Predictions for 2025 feel like they will just get too dark too quickly given my current mood. Likewise, even questions for the new year ran pretty dark when I started sorting some out in my head. So this year I am going to do wishes. Video game wishes. Let’s keep this manageable. You can wish for world peace on your own time. I am going to list out video game things I want to happen, things I hope will happen, things that might make things better, all in an unsubtle attempt to try and mine some optimism. We shall see. This is something of a turn around as I usually have to state clearly that just because I predict something doesn’t mean I want it to happen. Now I get to run with things I actually want to happen. I will state up front I won’t be wishing for anything bad to happen. No bad mojo. I will also endeavor to not be completely sarcastic or passive aggressive in my wishes…. but you know that is going to slip, right? Look, I am influenced by the world around me… and have you seen this place lately? So cut me some slack. There might be a barb or two in there, but I want my intentions to be clear and in the right place. And if my wishes don’t come true… well, that isn’t on ME now is it? I guess. Better wait until we see what I wish for. But I am going to be leaning heavily on the cosmos and the goodness of people to make this stuff come true. What I have I got then? What am I wishing for? 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Why start small, right? If you got wishes, throw them at a big problem. Unfortunately that lamp I was rubbing the other day… I hope that was a lamp… didn’t promise me anything. And an “end” might be too big of an ask. I would consider the wish fulfilled if we could at least see the industry cycle into a hiring phase and maybe hold of with the acquisition slash and burn to make the line go up a tiny fraction this week. I think I am already off to a bad start with a wish where I won’t be able measure. I guess I’ll just listen to video game devs and see what they’re complaining about. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title Just don’t call it EverQuest Next! Man, was that a dumb name. I am pretty sure that was my stance back whenever… but if it wasn’t, let me say that the name has not grown on me in the mean time. Okay, EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. There was a hint about it being in the ideation phase, but naught else. And while it was on track for 2028 maybe, I am keen to hear if the ideas for it are still rooted in the whole hardcore, be like Elden Ring thing that Ji Ham was espousing back in 2023. A bit of hope or a nugget to hang on to, but more than just some concept art. Lord knows how that screwed us back in the day. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Look, I don’t need full 4K support. That was always a pipe dream anyway. SSG is fully committed to simply maintaining the status quo and adding a bit of content to the game. The idea, for example, that it was ever going to be ported to consoles was absurd on its face, something I called out when that first came up. EG7 has since said they would rather spend the money on developing a new game… though Daybreak has been pretty shy on actually producing a “new” game so far. That said, there are probably half a dozen things of small to medium-ish effort that SSG could do that would make the game more viable on large screens. They could, as an example, get somebody to redo their bitmap skill icons as SVGs so they will not look like ass when you make the the hotbar bigger. (Also an opportunity to make them distinguishable rather than a bunch of red or green blobs with nonsensical iconography, which is something people were calling out back in 2007.) They could make scaling stick for the whole UI, as it reverts to defaults in an annoying number of places between sessions. And they could work on text and dialogs to make them readable on a 4K monitor… with a universal sizing setting maybe? I find it extremely annoying to have to tinker with every aspect of the UI and then have half of it revert when I log off. So just fix that shit. Put in the effort. Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. 5 – Commit to or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know I said no negatives, and I am trying not to go there, but EG7/Daybreak has been living in this delusion for quite a while now where they boost H1Z1 as one of their most important first party franchises at every opportunity while, at the same time, they spend no time or effort on actually doing anything with it. It has basically sat in limbo for since Nantworks gave up and handed the game back to Daybreak, unable to make anything good out of it. And I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Things don’t always go to plan and that roadmap was pretty squishy, but still… figure it out by the end of 2025; commit or stop pretending it is a thing. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing Blizz got a big bounce in hope by announcing that housing was coming to World of Warcraft. The thing they said they would not do, the thing they half-assed as garrisons it what looked like an attempt to prove their point that housing takes people out of the world, the thing that would probably up the long term subscriber retention rate by 5-10% if done right… yeah, do it… and do it right! What does “right” mean? I don’t know. I have a bunch of vague ideas and examples from other titles of things I felt worked and things that I felt did not. But Blizz and its ability to read the room is not something people have come to count on. We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace I feel that nearly a year of Cataclysm Classic has proven the point that classic progression servers can advance too slowly, and that isn’t going to get any better with some of the coming expansions. Find the right pacing Blizz. Also, this reminds me again that I had better consider how to check to see if my wishes have come true. Do wishes need to be SMART? I might not know if this one was granted in 2025. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new They have the money, they have the staff, they can surely find some new idea out in the industry to steal and re-work. They can’t have lost all their skill in that, can they? What non-Blizz titles do Blizz devs play now? Not all Clash of Clans I hope. That’s it though, isn’t it? They all just play phone games because they’re mostly in their 20s. Well, I can still wish I guess. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access I suppose removing the “early access” label from Valheim won’t change anything really. The dirty secret is that early access is your launch and you don’t get another one when you exit. There won’t be a huge spike in sales or a bunch of new press coverage or any magical change to the game when that hits. It will just be “done.” But sometimes “done” is enough. If they deliver the Northlands and wrap up the quest line so that you can finish the game, then that will be good. They could, if they wanted, go all Hello Games and continue to improve it over time, or it could just immediately go into maintenance mode, as so many early access transition titles do, as the team goes off to work on something else. Either way, completion is a nice thing. Maybe it will get some Steam achievements. That might make me go back and play it one more time. Overall though, I have gotten more than my money’s worth out of Valheim. I am done, it can be done. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access This is what started my whole survival co-op frenzy this past year. The mention of Hello Games making this stirred me up. I mean, I really want Light No Fire to launch fully formed because, after the evolution of No Man’s Sky into the game it is today, I want their co-op survival title and their take on the genre… even if it will inevitably be controller-centric. I can deal. But I will take a solid early access and go along for the ride. How much different would the No Man’s Sky journey have been if it had been early access for the first two years? Maybe no different… but maybe it would have set expectations that things were going to continue to evolve. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on While we’re talking about Hello Games, NMS is just a great example of a company committing to a title and just making it better and better over time. They got robbed on the Labor of Love category in the Steam Awards. Only NMS and Stardew Valley really met the criteria of the award. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles On my list for 2025 is Dune: Awakening. I liked a lot about Conan Exiles, and my hope is that Funcom will have learned from that… I mean, CE has been out more than six years at this point. I hope that journey has informed them and allowed them to do something cool with the Dune universe. Going to be an interesting one to judge whether the wish was granted or not. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving I am not one to care much about the monthly free games from Amazon Prime… like I don’t have enough unplayed games in my Steam library already… but when they offer up a code for GoG.com I grab it wholly on the assumption that GoG gets some payment for it and as the old game underdog I want them to succeed and thrive in a way I can only describe as completely opposite to my feelings for the Epic Game Store. (I will not wish bad things on the EGS in this post, but in my heart I might… mostly because Tim Sweeney is a bad person in the way that most US CEOs are bad people.) 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy Passive aggressive much? Actually, that assumes they know what they need to do and, given they have spent three years not doing anything of the sort. So maybe I cannot really argue that this assumption is grounded in any sort of reality. But still, these are wishes, so may the universe magic that knowledge into CCP Rattati’s fore brain and force him to look away from EVE Vanguard for long enough to tell somebody to implement it. 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Look, I am not happy with some of their choices. The blockchain game, EVE Frontier, can (and most likely will) die in a fire. I also do not share the CCP management dream of making a first person shooter, lacking faith in their ability to make something both interesting and unique enough to attract an audience outside of the relatively small New Eden user base. I am also not at all keen on them putting the biggest fan of said shooter in charge of the spaceship game. And EVE Galaxy Conquest… whatever. But, it is in the best interest of those of us who still play their one successful title that something else land and become a success, if only to stabilize the company and make Hilmar less keen to steal resources from the game I play to fund his blockchain fantasies. So if something else could succeed that would be great… and no monkey’s paw where the mobile game makes some money so they abandon EVE Online. In fact, let me just make a “no damn monkey’s paw” side rule right here. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title These are popular, CCP has some of the ground work done. They have more than 20 years of spaceships and nearly 15 years of FPS work in the bag now, maybe take a different tack and make something more manageable that could find a niche and grow? Just a thought. I’d play that… if it was any good at all. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Hey, wishes are free so while I’m here I might as well throw out the idea one more time about a space 4x strategy title set in New Eden where you can play as the main empires or as a null sec leader or even one of the pirate factions as scenarios that takes a strategic view of war and conquest in the New Ede star cluster. I don’t care how. License it to Paradox or something. Just do it. I know, the EVE Online IP isn’t at all popular so nobody would actually play it, but just tack a receptive strategy game audience on to the wish and call it done. We have all the wishes baby! 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done It is out there. He has announced he is working on the third and final volume of his history of null sec and New Eden. We’re going to hear about World War Bee and the great Siege of 1DQ1-A and Vily’s vendetta and eventually the downfall of The Mittani, which will probably be what brings the story to a close. And… well… I am eager to read it. I know it takes time, but that doesn’t mean I can be as patient as I need to be. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Andrew Groen could be tempted into a volume 4 if, you know, we did something interesting. I know, war depends heavily on CCP fixing the economy so alliances are willing to put trillions of ISK on the line. Also, we need something to fight over and CCP’s scarcity plan has backfired completely in that regard. I don’t know. Maybe Gobbins will go on the forums and say “there are no goons” or something. Send Vily back for a rematch. Have Brisc and Merk defect to Fraternity. Let The Initiative start some shit now that they have no blues. Something. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News I know, what we heard was a slip, an accident, but that makes it all the more interesting to find out what is really going on. I am also interested to hear what a dozen years of GW2 has taught the ANet team and how an third title might differ from the second. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll The end of the year game for us was Enshrouded and Keen Games has done a great job with it so for. I’ll even give them a pass the missing in-game chat. Turns out I can live without it is the rest of the game is this good. And a co-op survival builder doesn’t *need* a done state, but it still feels like we should be progressing towards a final boss to cleanse the world or something. So get us going there, keep expanding, and maybe not so many jumping puzzles. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach Playable Worlds still feels like they are a couple years away from Stars Reach being a real, live service game. The big break through was homesteads and 4 hour play tests this year. But there was a lot promised in the design pillars that has yet to see the light of day. Personally, I am waiting for space ships and space travel. So that is my wish I guess, at least get us to space travel in a test galaxy. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 I may regret this wish. Also, I don’t want this until the end of 2025 so I have some time left to get to 50. Niantic pretty much has to do this at some point. There is only so much horizontal progress they can try to pile on. Anyway, I would consider this fulfilled if they even announced a plan for a level cap increase in 2025. There are a lot of hardcore fans who have been at level 50 for a long time now. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake It is the next on the list of old Pokemon titles that have not been remade. It might get me to put my Switch Lite back on the charger and play with it now and then. I wasn’t keen on it as a title when it launched, but when I went back and played it on the 3DS one last time to complete all the pre-Switch titles, I found it had quite a bit to recommend it. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. Of course, I also want to know what horrible stain Marc Andreesen and his tainted, string laden cash has left on the company and the game. There was a promise of some sort of access in late 2025… but there was also a promise of access in 2014, so lies on top of lies seems to be the norm. So, you know, do something already? That is positive, right? 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck There is a long standing tradition in the Civ series of shipping something that really requires the next generation of computers to run. Also bugs, crashes, and a game that really doesn’t settle down until we’ve been sold at least one post-launch expansion pack. I’d like a new Civ game… almost as much as I would like Civ II to be brought up to date… but I have also been there since the dawn of the original… roll that ancient magic quote about being there when they were written… and it has always been a bit of a nightmare on launch. So here is hoping that Sid’s likely final launch for the series is smoother than tradition seems to dictate. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Look, it felt bad to see GTA V fall off of the Platinum tier on the Best of Steam 2024. I mean, Silver tier? Sure, not bad for an 11 year old game, but that probably also means we need a new version. I might not play it, but I feel like I need a couple more gimme wishes in here or my seasonal depression will really ramp up about 12 months from now. 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Then there is Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street and his company Fantastic Pixel Castle, which has been working on an MMO for a couple years now, though this might be my first time mentioning it here on the blog. They have some ideas for a new game, which includes private zones for you and your friends and public zones where you can come into conflict with others and a bunch of things, some of which is being play tested now. It is probably as far along as Stars Reach, maybe further, so it won’t launch in 2025 or even go early access in 2025, but if they had a target date for public access to the game along with a lot more information, I’d consider this wish fulfilled. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish Some little indie studio that I have not heard of at the time of this writing will have a big break-out success and live the indie dev dream for a while. For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominates and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. Work with me on this. I am just going to let this ride until we get to the decision point in December. Why run my wishes any different than my projects at work? 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real Why the hell not? They’re just wishes! Bonus Wishes All wishes are a bonus, that is why they are wishes, right? But in the event that I come up with some additional wish I want to add in, it will be injected here with a time stamp and the cosmos will not be graded down should the wish not be granted. The cosmos will, however, get full credit if the wish is granted. Wish Scoring Dare I score wishes? Like I said, if they don’t come true that is on the cosmos and not me. I am just the wisher, it is up to the wishee to see that wishes come to pass. Is the cosmos going to get pissed if I try to score it? We shall see! That said, some of this still has to play out like predictions. The cosmos will earn 10 points for each wish fulfilled, with partial credit available. Since I am not the one being scored I will tend to be inclined to give the cosmos credit for getting part way there if, say, Civ VII launches as a train wreck but is fixed before summer ends. Just an example. Also, I mentioned SMART above, which stands for “Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time Related,” and you could certainly call me out for some of my wishes not hitting all five. But when it comes to time, if wishes are not fulfilled by December 15, 2025, they will be considered unfulfilled for the purposes of scoring. That is the drop dead date… though if, say, GTA VI launches on December 16th, because it is a Tuesday, then the cosmos will get full credit even if Rockstar will get some dubious looks for such a late in the year launch. The cosmos has 300 points on the table it can earn. We’ll be back in about a year to see how it does for 2025. Off we go. There are consequences to be borne and whirlwinds to be reaped. So that is what I have. What are your happy, positive, maybe slightly passive-aggressive video game wishes for 2025? Did I miss something important? Meanwhile, others have placed stakes in the ground with their own predictions. Here are a few I picked up: Stars Reach is weirdly much further along in development than I imagined it would be and yet wildly far from being anything remotely to close to the game it’s promoted as being. The fact that a game supposedly set in space has no actual space travel is confounding. I really don’t think the current Invisible Elevator To Orbit counts. I hadn’t thought until I read the post what a paradox No Man’s Sky is. These days the received wisdom seems absolutely to be that Early Access is the kiss of death and keeping your powder dry for Full Launch is the only way to go. And yet, as you point out, a premature launch wrecked NMS whereas Early Access could have seen the game lauded almost from the start as an in-development title that was living up to its promise. There would literally not need to be any other differences at all to the pace and content of development other than the labels that were attached to it at certain times. Maybe EA has its benefits after all. Speaking of which, I was waiting for Pantheon to come up in the wish list until it didn’t. Have you checked how EA is going for them? Very well, apparently. A Very Positve Steam rating from more than a thousand reviews and a Currently Playing total that’s still creeping up. I did not expect either of those. Still don’t want to play it but I guess we can wish that the people who do keep on enjoying themselves. LikeLiked by 1 person Like so many things, early access works, except when it doesn’t. You have to have something obviously good for it to work. It is not a shield against criticism. I didn’t have much in the way of thoughts about Pantheon. It does seem to be doing okay, hitting peak concurrent so far today and almost 80% positive reviews. But it also isn’t a buy once title, it is an MMO with a server and staff to maintain. We’ll have to see if what they have so far is enough or if they can grow it. LikeLike Meanwhile, Fantasy Critic just chimed in with this. Did it read my wishes? Fantasy Critic: Half-Life 3 [Available] Just added! Tags: New Game, Unannounced Game Release Date: Unannounced (Estimated) LikeLike The G-Man himself makes me think your Half-Life 3 wish is closer to being true than we might realize: https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922 I don’t care about any cinematic or major announcement. Just let Valve show me a lambda symbol with a 3 on it and I’ll be pumped for *years*. (I mean, this is Valve we’re talking about. They are the only company that makes old-school Blizzard seem fast…) LikeLiked by 1 person My wishes on the computer game front are very modest. 1 – Paradox not to wreck HoI4/Stellaris/EU4 2 – Terra Invicta to continue to be developed. 3 – LOTRO to keep on going 4 – FF14 to remain a generally chill and friendly place, unlike some other fantasy worlds one could mention. For those where I actually have to do something myself: 5 – Complete at least one of the RPGs I love (but where I keep getting distracted) 6 – Complete base Endwalker in FF14 (currently in Shadowbringers, but I dawdle) 7 – Complete a play through on at least one currently unplayed game in my Steam Library. We shall see LikeLiked by 1 person I also really hope GOG sticks around. DRM-free games are always nice to have, and I appreciate how they try to keep the games they sell playable on modern operating systems. LikeLiked by 1 person FWIW, Valheim is still on my Steam Wishlist, but I’m one of those nuts who refuse to buy a game that is in Early Access. Once it leaves Early Access and I know the game has a complete storyline, I’m in. LikeLike I feel you. As I replied to Bhagpuss, early access is one of those things that works, except when it doesn’t. In the case of Valheim I think what is there when it does comes out of early access will be much better than what might have arrived had they insisted on waiting until it was “done” to launch it. Or not. The whole “must be annoyingly difficult” aspects of the last three biomes might have been skipped had they waited. Who knows? I will say, once again, that I got my money’s worth out of it with three big play-throughs. LikeLike Wishes do have a sort of ‘softness’ or positivity versus predictions that I like. Kudos for coming up with that. Half Life 3: I feel like I’m too out of touch with all of the ‘2+’ material now to be the proper audience for the game. Back in the day in the year or two after Half Life 2 launched I was desperate for the next episode. Now I’d probably need a full set of remakes of the intermediate content to get up to speed again. LikeLike The 20th Anniversary update might just be the thing for you, then: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001. Both episodes and the Lost Coast bit are now included with the main game. LikeLike The WoW roadmap you linked does show housing coming at the end of 2025… so we might get to find out about that wish sooner than you seem to think! LikeLike The roadmap shows a little icon, which could mean whatever Blizz decides it means. Given their history, I have trouble seeing Blizz launching housing outside of a full expansion release, and we aren’t even getting the next expansion reveal until late next year. I am skeptical like that. Anyway, my wish is that they don’t screw it up. We might know enough to register that before Dec. 15. LikeLike I knew you were gonna say that! 😄 It’s because of people like you (or possibly other reasons) that they actually changed the roadmap from the original image (which matches the one you uploaded) to one that simply shows a house at that point. LikeLike They changed the icon later? How rude! Still, it is just an icon, which lends itself to some level of ambiguity. It could mean housing starts for the holidays. It could mean the big housing reveal with a launch at a later date. It could mean an new trailer with no details. And, where it stands, it could mean nothing before Dec. 15th, so no wish granted.

Title: Databases in 2024: A Year in Review
URL: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2025/01/2024-databases-retrospective.html
Time Published: 2025-01-01T14:27:39Z
Full Content:
Like a shot to your dome piece, I'm back to hit you with my annual roundup of what happened in the rumble-tumble game of databases. Yes, I used to write this article on the OtterTune blog, but the company is dead (RIP). I'm doing this joint on my professor blog. There is much to cover from the past year, from 10-figure acquisitions, vendors running wild in the streets with license changes, and the most famous database octogenarian splashing cash to recruit a college quarterback to impress his new dimepiece. I promised my first wife that I would write more professionally this year. I have also been informed that some universities assign my annual blog articles as required reading in their database courses. Let's see how it goes. Previous entries: We live in the golden era of databases. There are many excellent (relational) choices for all types of application domains. Many are open-source despite being built by for-profit companies backed by VC money. But VCs want that money back and their trap full, so these companies turn out a hosted service for their DBMSs on the cloud. But the cloud makes open-source DBMSs a tricky business. If a system becomes too popular, then a cloud vendor (like Amazon) slaps it up as a service and makes more money than the company paying for the development of the software. This threat is why many database companies change to more restrictive source code licenses that protect against cloud vendors from reselling their products. MongoDB was among the first to do this in 2018 when they switched to their Server Side Public License (SSPL). This past year was a turbulent one for license changes, and the most prominent two were Redisâ¢ and Elasticsearch. Redis Ltd. (the company) is on an aggressive path towards its IPO. Originally starting as Redis Labs in 2011, they switched their name to Redis Ltd. in 2021 when they acquired the Redis trademark from its creator (Salvatore Sanfilippo), who Redis Labs had bankrolled. Over the last few years, Redis Ltd. has attempted to consolidate control over the Redis landscape. The company has also tried to cast off the perception that the system is primarily used as an in-memory cache by adding support for vectors and other data models. In March 2024, Redis Ltd. announced they were switching from the system's original (very permissive) BSD-3 license to a dual license comprising the proprietary Redis Source Available License and MongoDB's SSPL. The company announced this change the same day they announced the acquisition of Speedb, an open-source fork of RocksDB. The backlash to the Redis license move was quick. The same week the license changed, two forks were announced based on the original BSD-3 code line: Valkey and Redict. Valkey started at Amazon, but engineers at Google and Oracle quickly joined. In only one week, the Valkey project clapped back at Redis Ltd. when it became part of the Linux Foundation, and several major companies shifted their development efforts to it. Redis Ltd. did not help their perception of being up to no good when they got frisky with their beloved trademark and started taking over open-source Redis extensions. In an obvious homage to when Bushwick Bill (RIP), Scarface, and Willie D got back together in 2015, the Redis' creator announced in December 2024 that he is in touch with the Redis Ltd. management and is looking to make a comeback to reunite the Redis community. Elastic N.V. is the for-profit company backing the development of the leading text-search Elasticsearch DBMS. In 2021, they announced their switch to a dual-license model of the Elastic License and MongoDB's SSPL. Again, this was in response to the rising prominence of Amazon's Elasticsearch offering, even though the service had been out since 2015. Amazon didn't take this switch kindly and announced their OpenSearch fork. Three years later, Elastic N.V. announced in August 2024 that they reverted their license change and switched to the AGPL. Their blog article announcing this change references Kendrick Lamar's songs (e.g., Not Like Us). Amazon did not like being called the Drake of Databases and announced the following month that they were transferring ownership of the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation. This turmoil seems like a lot just over licenses, but remember, there is big money in databases. And this is just two systems! I didn't even discuss Greenplum quietly killing off their open-source repository after nine years and going proprietary. But people did not notice because nobody willingly runs Greenplum anymore. The only DBMS I know of that made the same open-source reversal is Altibase in 2023. I'll be blunt: I don't care for Redis. It is slow, it has fake transactions, and its query syntax is a freakshow. Our experiments at CMU found Dragonfly to have much more impressive performance numbers (even with a single CPU core). In my database course, I use the Redis query language as an example of what not to do. Nevertheless, I am sympathetic to Redis Ltd.'s plight of being overrun by Amazon. However, the company is overestimating the barrier of entry to build a simplistic system like Redis; it is much lower than building a full-featured DBMS (e.g., Postgres), so there are several alternatives to the OG Redis. They are not in position of strength where such posturing will be tolerated by the community. The Elasticsearch saga is the same story as Redis, except they are further along in the plot: the company announces license change, competitors create an open-source fork, and the company reverts to an open-source license to muted fanfare. Notice that Redis and Elasticsearch are receiving more backlash compared to other systems that made similar moves. There was no major effort to fork off MongoDB, Neo4j, Kafka, or CockroachDB when they announced their license changes. CockroachDB even changed its license again in 2024 to make larger enterprises start paying up. It cannot be because the Redis and Elasticsearch install base is so much larger than these other systems, and therefore, there were more people upset by the change since the number of MongoDB and Kafka installations was equally as large when they switched their licenses. In the case of Redis, I can only think that people perceive Redis Ltd. as unfairly profiting off others' work since the company's founders were not the system's original creators. An analysis of Redis' source code repository also shows that a sizable percentage of contributions to the DBMS comes from outside the company (e.g., Tencent, Alibaba). This "stolen valor" was the reason for the ire HashiCorp received when they changed Terraform's license in 2023. The overarching issue in these license shuffles is the long-term viability of open-source independent software vendors (ISVs) in the database market. The cloud vendors are behemoths with infinite money. If an open-source DBMS takes off, they will start hosting it and make more money than the ISV. Or they will add your DBMS's wire protocol as a front-end to an existing DBMS, like when AWS added InfluxDB v2 protocol support for their Timestream DBMS in March 2024. They can then be the girlfriend of the aforementioned Bushwick Bill and shoot you in the eye, like when AWS announced that their new Valkey-compatible services are 30% cheaper than their Redis-compatible services. There continues to be no love lost between Databricks and Snowflake. This fight is a classic database war that has spilled out into the streets. The two companiesâ previous feud over query performance has expanded to other areas of data management and become much more expensive. Databricks took the first shot in March 2024 when they announced they spent $10 million to build their DBRX open-source LLM with 132 billion parameters. The Mosaic team led the development of the DBRX model, which Databricks acquired in 2023 for $1.3 billion. One month later, Snowflake rolled up to the same corner and lit it up using their Arctic open-source LLM with 480 billion parameters. Snowflake boasted they only spent $2 million to train their model while outperforming DBRX for âenterpriseâ tasks like SQL generation. You can tell that Snowflake cares most about taking a shot at Databricks because their announcement shows other LLMs doing better than them (e.g., Llama3), but they highlight how they are better than DBRX. One AI researcher was confused about why Snowflake focused so much on DBRX in their analysis and not the other models; this person does not know how much blood these two database rivals have spilled. While the public LLM battle raged, another front in the war between Databricks and Snowflake opened up behind the scenes over catalogs. For most of the 2010s, Hiveâs HCatalog has been the de facto catalog system on data lakes. Iceberg and Hudi emerged as replacements in the late 2010s from Netflix and Uber, respectively, and both became top-level Apache projects backed by VC-funded startups. These systems provide a meta-data service to track files and support transactional ingestion of new data on an object store (e.g., S3). Databricks has a proprietary catalog service called Unity, which works with its DeltaLake platform. Snowflake announced their initial integration with Iceberg-backed tables in 2022. They then expanded their support for Iceberg over the next few years. Then, they looked into acquiring Tabular, the main company behind Iceberg, to compete against Databricks with Unity and DeltaLake. The story goes that Snowflake was about to close the deal for $600 million. But then Databricks crashed the party and splashed $2 billion to acquire Tabular. Databricks announced the acquisition the same day as the Snowflake CEOâs conference keynote address, where he was announcing their new open-source Polaris catalog service in June 2024. Databricks continued to kick Snowflake in the teeth when they announced they were open-sourcing their Unity catalog the following week. Straight murdergram. What is interesting about this database battle is that it is not just about raw performance numbers. It isnât like the old Oracle versus Informix shootout of the 1990s, where they were mostly boasting about faster query latencies. It is true that the battle also went beyond just benchmark shots when Informix sued Oracle (and later had to withdraw their suit) because Oracle poached some top Informix executives. Later, the world found out that the Informix CEO had cooked the companyâs books to inflate revenue numbers to look better against Oracle and had to do a two-month bid in the federal clink. Instead, the Snowflake versus Databricks battle has expanded to be about the ecosystem around the database. That is, it is about the infrastructure people use to get their data into a database and then the tools they use on that data. Vectorized execution engines for analytical queries are a commodity now. Databricks and every other OLAP vendor follow Snowflakeâs architecture design from 2013, originally based on one of the Snowflake co-foundersâ Ph.D. thesis. What matters now are quality-of-life facets (which are hard to monetize and compare with competitors), compatibility with other tools, and AI/LLM magic. At least the competition between Snowflake and Databricks has an upside for consumers. Such ferocity means better products and technology for data (e.g., Snowflakeâs Polaris is now an Apache project) and eventually (hopefully) lower prices. Itâs not like the previous pissing match between Oracle and SalesForce CEOs, where it was two rich guys taking pop shots at each other during their expensive conferences. In the same way that Postgres is the default choice for anyone starting a new operational database, DuckDB has entered the zeitgeist as the default choice for someone wanting to run analytical queries on their data. Pandas previously held DuckDB's crowned position. Given DuckDB's insane portability, there are several efforts to stick it inside existing DBMSs that do not have great support for OLAP workloads. This year, we saw the release of four different extensions to stick DuckDB up inside Postgres. The first announcement came in May 2024 when Crunchy Data revealed their proprietary bridge for rewiring Postgres to route OLAP queries to DuckDB. They later announced an expanded version of their extension to leverage DuckDB's geospatial capabilities to accelerate PostGIS queries. In June 2024, ParadeDB announced their open-source extension (pg_analytics) that uses Postgres' foreign data wrapper API to call into DuckDB; they previously were using DataFusion in an earlier version (pg_lakehouse) but switched to the Duck. Then, in August 2024, the next DuckDB-for-Postgres extension (pg_duck) came out. The source code for this extension is hosted under the DuckDB Labs GitHub organization. As such, this is the officially sanctioned DuckDB extension for Postgres. The original announcement touted this project as being a collaboration between MotherDuck, Hydra, Microsoft, and Neon. The latter two were (allegedly) kicked out of the mix over a dispute on development controls, similar to Arabian Prince leaving NWA. The repository now only lists it as a joint effort between MotherDuck and Hydra. The latest DuckDB extension dropped in November 2024 with pg_mooncake. Mooncake differs from the other three because it supports writing data through Postgres into Iceberg tables with full transaction support. Most OLAP queries do not access that much data. Fivetran analyzed traces from Snowflake and Redshift and showed that the median amount of data scanned by queries is only 100 MB. Such a small amount of data means a single DuckDB instance is enough for most to handle most queries. DuckDB's convenience and portability are the reasons for its proliferation in the Postgres community. Although ClickHouse has existed since 2016, it was not as easy to run as DuckDB until recently (see this blog article that discusses the steps to deploy ClickHouse in 2018). These DuckDB extensions are a single entry point to the broader data ecosystem. Users no longer need to install separate extensions to access data in Iceberg and separately for S3. DuckDB can handle all of that for you. It allows organizations to gain high-performance analytics without needing an expensive data warehouse. Postgres' support for extensions and plugins is impressive. One of the original design goals of Postgres from the 1980s was to be extensible. The intention was to easily support new access methods and new data types and operations on those data types (i.e., object-relational). Since 2006, Postgres' "hook" API. Our research shows that Postgres has the most expansive and diverse extension ecosystem compared to every other DBMS. We also found that the DBMS's lack of guard rails means that extensions can interfere with each other and cause incorrect behavior. Earlier projects that added columnar storage to Postgres (e.g., Citus, Timescale) only solved part of the problem. Columnar data formats improve retrieving data from storage. However, a DBMS cannot fully exploit those formats if it still uses a row-oriented query processing model (e.g., Postgres). Using DuckDB provides both columnar storage and vectorized query processing. There is likely a turducken joke here involving an elephant, but I will not make it because I do not want to get fired or put on probation by the university (again). Many one-off events happened with databases last year that you might have overlooked. Here is a quick summary of them: There isn't much public information yet about how AWS implemented their new "Spanner-like" DBMS (see Mark Brooker's discussion about the DBMS architecture). The key ideas are a distributed log service (rumors were it was going to be based on now-defunct QLDB) and timestamp ordering via Time Sync. But this announcement shows you how much brand recognition the name "Aurora" carries in the database world because AWS used it for this new DBMS that seemingly shares no code with their flagship Aurora Postgres RDS offering. Umbra is one of the most state-of-the-art DBMSs written by the world's greatest database systems researcher (Thomas Neumann). But Thomas is content with staying at his university to work on Umbra, remaining comfortably on top of the Clickbench leaderboard, and not worrying about pesky customers. That's why his top Ph.D. students forked his code and are commercializing it as CedarDB. The only interesting part of this announcement is that the former vanguard of the NoSQL movement in the late 2000s now supports SQL in 2024. Turso has been working on the libSQL fork of SQLite for a while, but they went all out in 2024 by announcing a complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust. In their announcement, they correctly point out that the value of SQLite is not just from its code, but also from the insane test engineering that ensures it runs correctly everywhere. That is why the Limbo developers are working with a deterministic testing startup by ex-FoundationDB people. See FoundationDB's 2020 CMU-DB talk for more information on what this testing means. This key-value store is the successor to the impressive FASTER system from Microsoft Research. It is compatible with Redis and supports inter-query parallelism, larger-than-memory databases, and real transactions. Redis should not be anybody's first choice these days. Six years after MySQL v8 went GA, the team turned v9 out on the streets. But people quickly found that it crashed if your database had more than 8000 tables. I am underwhelmed with the feature list in this new major version. Oracle is putting all its time and energy into its proprietary MySQL Heatwave service. MySQL is still widely used, but the excitement is not there anymore. Everyone has moved on to Postgres. It has been seven years since the latest major version of Prometheus. There are so many compatible alternatives now that the OG Prometheus may not be the best option for some organizations. I've never met anybody who uses Alteryx, and I don't have an opinion about them. Hopefully the PE people buying the MariaDB Corporation can clean up the mess. See my analysis from last year about the MariaDB dumpster fire. This purchase makes sense if you are one of the leading Postgres ISVs. Postgres has a great front-end but an outdated storage architecture. OrioleDB fixes that problem. Better ETL tooling to get data out of Postgres and into ClickHouse. This is a smart move by ClickHouse, Inc. They bought themselves a fancy SQL editor UI. It is a quality-of-life improvement. See the discussion above. They are likely going to use Speedb to allow Redis to spill data to disk. Speedb's developers never explained what changes and improvements they made in their RocksDB fork (or I could not find it?). See Mark Callaghan's recent comparison of Speedb vs. RocksDB. This is big news for the company, but unfortunately they had to shutdown the DBaaS in September 2024. Rockset had a great engineering team with some of the best database engineers from Facebook. I just never liked how their DBMS stored three copies of your data in its indexes. Again, see the discussion above. Iceberg is the standard (sorry Hudi); even Amazon S3 now supports it. It remains to be seen how the adoption of Polaris will evolve and whether they will be able to maintain compatibility in the long term. I guess Cloudera is still alive? Rewriting Kafka in golang but then making it spill to S3. I'm happy for the Warpstream team, but Confluent could have done this themselves. There are a few more raises from CedarDB, SpiralDB, and others but those amounts are not public yet. If Amazon can't figure out how to make money on a blockchain database, then nobody can. And yes, I know QLDB is not a true P2P blockchain, but it's close enough. Dana, Bohan, and I worked on this research project and startup for almost a decade. And now it is dead. I am disappointed at how a particular company treated us at the end, so they are forever banned from recruiting CMU-DB students. They know who they are and what they did. I want to also give special props to Andres Freund for discovering the xz backdoor in 2024 while working on Postgres at Microsoft. This attack was a two-year campaign to inject malicious code into an important compression library widely used in computing. Although the backdoor targeted SSH and not Postgres directly, it is another example of why database engineers are some of the best programmers in the world. Databricks has blown away all other fundraising in the world of databases for the second year in a row with a disgustingly brash $10 billion Series J round. This is after their $500 million Series I in 2023 and $1.6 billion Series H in 2021. What is different about this time is this funding was for buying stock from employees who were getting impatient about Databricks' inevitable IPO. CMU-DB has several alumni at Databricks, including a former #1 ranked Ph.D. student. I know some of them are anxiously awaiting the Databricks IPO before deciding what to do next. The upcoming year is going to be the test of strength for many database startups. Nobody wants to be the next MariaDB Corporation, and thus several are waiting to ride Databricks' wake before going IPO themselves. Declining interest rates in the upcoming year may open up additional funding for several database companies that have raised large amounts more than two years ago (e.g., CockroachDB, Starburst, Imply, DataStax, SingleStore, Firebolt). The one standout from this crowd is dbtLabs, which I have heard is comfortably crushing it. See also the Database of Databases list of new DBMSs released in 2024. Do you know who had their 80th birthday this year? The legendary Larry Ellison! Once again, we see that he is a man who refuses to settle down or be put into a box. First, Larry propelled himself up Forbes' Billionaires List to become the third richest person in the world. In March 2024, the Oracle stock rose so much that he made $15 billion in a single day. Flush with cash, Larry went shopping in July 2024 and signed a deal to purchase Paramount Studios at $6 billion for his only son (third wife). He then decided to relax by buying a Palm Beach resort for only $277 million. These moves happened in just one year, and databases paid for all of it. But these are mere trifles compared to Larry's most significant accomplishment in 2024. Everyone I know was surprised when our Larry Ellison news alerts woke us up in the middle of the night in November 2024. The headlines were touting how Larry helped the University of Michigan football program recruit the premiere college quarterback. The university had previously announced that this player was transferring from Louisiana State to Michigan. Their press release included a curious acknowledgement to "Larry and his wife Jolin" for helping with the recruiting effort. Reporters soon confirmed that this "Larry" was the one and only Larry Ellison! Larry contributed $12 million to the booster campaign to bankroll the best quarterback's move to Michigan. The bigger mystery in this story was the identity of this "Jolin" person. Investigators found older photos of Larry watching a tennis match with a woman wearing a Michigan hat. Then, two weeks later, a major news organization broke the story at 5:30 am (my alerts woke me up again) that the woman's identity was Jolin (Keren) Zhu and they confirmed that she was Larry's new wife. I am beaming with pride over what Larry accomplished in the past year. He famously did not graduate from any university and had no prior connection to the University of Michigan. And yet, because the love of his life went to Michigan about a decade ago, Larry made magic happen by writing a check for a measly $12 million (about 0.0055% of his net worth). I told Larry this especially means a lot to me because my former #1 ranked Ph.D. student is now a professor in Michigan's Computer Science department with their famous Database Group. What is even more fantastic about this story is that Larry is again in love! Too many people struggle in today's world to find that special somebody. Dating apps are a mess, speed dating events are awkward, and it is now considered uncouth to hang around a playground to meet single parents when you do not have kids of your own. Then, just when you think you finally found the right person, it all falls apart when you learn they do not wash their socks regularly or like to put hot sauce on cold cereal. That is why everyone was telling me that Larry would never get married again after his 2010 divorce from romance novelist Melanie Craft (fourth wife). Those people were telling me the same thing after his 2020 divorce from Nikita Kahn (fifth wife). But I knew better, and Larry proved me right with his surreptitious marriage to Keren Zhu (sixth wife)! I was planning on starting this article boasting how this is the first time in three years where I was celebrating NYE not sick. But then my biological daughter gave me COVID so I'm laid up with that. I got boosted back in September and they gave me Paxlovid, so I'll survive this. I am disappointed that OtterTune is dead. But I learned a lot and got to work with many brilliant people. I am a big fan of Intel Capital and Race Capital for sticking with us to the end. I hope to announce our next start-up soon (hint: itâs about databases). In the meantime, I am happy to be back full-time at Carnegie Mellon University. Jignesh Patel and I have some baller research projects that we hope to turn out this upcoming year. I am also looking forward to teaching a new course on query optimization this semester. I need to figure out to juice my stats because in September 2024, Wikipedia removed the article about me over not having enough citations. We are staying true to DJ Mooshoo while he is locked up in Cook County. We hope to free him in 2025. Lastly, I want to give a shout-out to ByteBase for their article Database Tools in 2024: A Year in Review. In previous years, they emailed me asking for permission to translate my end-of-year database articles into Chinese for their blog. This year, they could not wait for me to finish writing this one, so they jocked my flow and wrote their own off-brand article with the same title and premise.

Title: 2024 gaming report card: how did PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo fare?

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? After a long and busy 12 months, 2024 is officially in the books. Players have a few weeks to rest before the video game release calendar picks up in February with a barrage of major releases. That’s a problem for next month, though. Until then, we’ve still got some time to reflect on what was a rollercoaster year for the gaming industry, full of surprise hits, total flops, and surprising no shows. At the center of all that was the three pillars of mainstream gaming: Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. While their power may be waning in the age of portable PCs like the Steam Deck, these platform holders are still the watercooler conversation starters whose every move generates buzz. This year, all three companies found themselves in a strange spot. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X hit the awkward midpoint of their lifespans, while the Nintendo Switch was left to tread water after its much anticipated successor was pushed out of 2024. All three would have to get creative if they were going to end the year strong. The good news is that all three pulled that task off, even if no one excelled. Each company had an asterisk on its record that created an uneven year no matter which console you played on. Continuing last year’s tradition, we’re once again closing out the year by handing out final grades to Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. All three passed, but they’ll all need to study harder if they’re going to become A students in 2025. If I were a tough grader, I’d have good reason to flunk the PS5 this year. Sony’s year was full of flops and disappointments that made its 2024 look dire in a vacuum. Its biggest hardship came in the form of Concord, a game that was meant to usher in PlayStation’s live service future. Instead, it was an immediate failure that was taken offline in weeks and the studio behind it was shuttered. That one costly disaster may have put years of planning in jeopardy, single-handedly changing what PlayStation’s future will look like. That bad news was coupled by some soft letdowns. The much anticipated PS5 Pro finally launched this year, but with underwhelming specs considering its eye-popping price tag. That made the system a slow starter, one that raised questions about how much incremental power is really necessary in a console. It didn’t help that the system’s AI upscaling tool, PSSR, was a bit buggy at launch, too. Elsewhere on the hardware front, Sony seemed to all but abandon its VR ambitions, offering very little software support for PlayStation VR2 (it’s biggest upgrade this year was PC support). At times, it felt like Sony’s hardware business had hit a brick wall. If I were only looking at those lowlights, though, it would be a reductive view of what was a strong year for PlayStation overall. Sony’s wins didn’t come from hyped up first-party exclusives like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but through unexpected surprises that helped expand the system to new audiences. The crown jewel of the crop was Astro Bot, which found Sony once again making the kind of all-ages platformer that helped build the original PlayStation. Helldivers 2 emerged as a live service success story that counter-balanced Concord‘s failure. Even Stellar Blade landed as a pleasant surprise, allowing a Korean developer to find international success. In between those peaks, we got a handful of third-party exclusives that gave the PS5 the best game lineup of any console this year. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth delivered the praise that Final Fantasy XVI couldn’t quite achieve in 2023, while Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 pulled off the impossible task of remaking one of the best games of all time in a satisfying manner. Those highs were enough to round out an uneven year where Sony leaned heavily on unnecessary double dips like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It may have been the PS5’s best and worst year in one. Grade: B Since the launch of the Xbox Series X in 2020, it was clear that Microsoft’s console was going to have an unusual lifespan. Microsoft made it clear early on that it wasn’t necessarily trying to pump out killer apps so much as it was trying to make Game Pass a lifestyle subscription service that every gamer needed. 2024 would take that experiment to some truly unpredictable places that left Xbox fans with whiplash; we seemingly alternated between terrible news and great games every month. The bad side was very bad. Xbox kicked the year off with mass layoffs, which shut down both Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. The latter was incredibly puzzling considering that the studio had developed perhaps the Series X’s best exclusive, Hi-Fi Rush, just one year prior. Later in the year, Microsoft rolled out a convoluted Game Pass price hike that turned the “best deal in gaming” into a pricey proposition. It didn’t help that some of the service’s biggest games didn’t exactly pan out as expected. Both Stalker 2 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 were buggy messes at launch, while Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 and Starfield: Shattered Space landed as underwhelming releases. It was a constant PR crisis for Xbox in 2024, even when it wasn’t warranted. Xbox’s decision to release certain exclusives on competing platforms should have been a cause for celebration as Microsoft eroded the annoying exclusivity wall that divides consoles. Instead, the move fueled console war outrage. Similar, Xbox made great strides to make its game more accessible than ever, bringing Game Pass to devices like Amazon Fire Stick. That too was criticized thanks to the company’s “This is an Xbox” ad campaign, which implied that any device that could run its games was essentially an Xbox. That move rubbed console purists the wrong way, but I see the underlying message as a positive step forward for video games. While it wasn’t a huge year for exclusives, Xbox delivered where it mattered. It ended the year strong with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, two of the best-received games of this Xbox generation. In route to those tentpole release, we got a steady stream of “day one” third-party releases that still sold the service’s value. Dungeons of Hinterberg and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess are both sleeper hits that ended up on Digital Trends best 10 games of 2024 list. With that in mind, I’m willing to let Xbox out of 2024 with a perfectly good, if unremarkable grade. I expect to see some big improvement in 2025, though. Grade: B- After receiving a coveted A grade in last year’s report, Nintendo had a big task ahead of it — and it sounded like it would have no problem delivering. After all, 2024 was surely going to be the year we finally got the Nintendo Switch 2, bringing a bevy of heavy hitting exclusives like Mario Kart 9 or Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Well … that didn’t happen. After all the anticipation, Nintendo’s new console was a total no show. Nintendo would acknowledge its existence after years of speculation, but it stopped short of actually showing it off or announcing so much as a spec. That left Nintendo in a weird spot when it came to software. It was clear that the company’s most celebrated developers were quietly working on new games for the platform, leaving the B-squad to fill out the Switch’s final full year. To Nintendo’s credit, it delivered at least one exclusive a month from January to December, but the actually lineup was eclectic. Very few Switch exclusives released in 2024 were must-own library additions. The closest ones were Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, but nothing rose to the level of Super Mario Odyssey or Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Instead, we got a buffet of niche games and odd remakes. It’s not that games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong or Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition weren’t welcome on Switch; it’s just that these were the console’s primary games rather than quirky filler. Those games didn’t always deliver either, as games like Endless Ocean: Luminous and Princess Peach: Showtime! felt more like underdeveloped experiments than the kind of polished games we’ve come to expect in the Switch’s lifespan. Even if it was an underwhelming year overall, the experimental nature of Switch’s year occasionally led to the kind of highlights that can only happen when a publisher isn’t being precious. Emio — The Smiling Man is a fantastic revival of Famicom Detective Club that I don’t think we would ever get outside of a year like this. Splatoon 3‘s underappreciated Side Order DLC is a true hidden gem, and I can’t complain about a full remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. The peaks weren’t exactly high, but this is the kind of strange year that I imagine I’ll look back on with nostalgia in a few years when Nintendo is back in its usual rotation of predictable hits. Grade: C+ With all of the political turmoil right now, it can be hard to get in the festive spirit — but PowerWash Simulator wants to help with its latest free update, offering a Christmas-themed ice rink map to explore and clean up. You might think you've gotten your fill of that already, especially if you had to clean real-world decorations before bringing them in from the garage, but we promise that digital muck is a lot more fun to clean up than the real thing. And we'll take digital spiders over the real ones any day of the week. Grab a nice warm cup of hot chocolate, some comfortable shoes, and snuggle up for a night of the most fun cleaning you've ever done. The update introduces a new, free DLC that comes with the ice rink area, as well as winter weather gear so that you can bundle up while on the job. The clothing includes a cleaning suit emblazoned with snowflakes, a candy cane theme for the sprayer, and more. If you've never played the game before, now's the perfect chance. The update also comes with a free demo so you can get a taste of what makes this game so relaxing to play. If you find you enjoy it, there's plenty more free DLC to check out yourself, as well as paid DLC for fans of Shrek and Warhammer: 40,000. The MMO genre is overflowing with titles vying for the attention of anyone willing to invest significant portions of their time in a single game. There are no doubt plenty of killer choices you can make based on what type of combat, endgame, and payment model you prefer, ensuring that you'll almost certainly find one that fits you just right. I've been investing off and on in the genre for over two decades, with thousands of hours poured into everything from old, niche titles like Silkroad Online (which I just learned somehow still exists) to worldwide successes like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars. In recent years, though, I find myself disappointed in various aspects of many popular MMOs, whether it's an overwhelming focus on endgame raiding, too much PVP-centric content, or unfriendly communities that make me cringe when I even glance at the chat. None of that is a problem when I return to Final Fantasy XIV. I somehow feel at peace each time I load up Square Enix's long-running MMO, and it's becoming harder and harder for me to want to venture elsewhere. Sony could be following up the release of the PlayStation Portal with a new handheld PlayStation 5 console, according to a new report. Bloomberg claims that Sony is working on a portable PlayStation 5 and would be in direct competition with the Nintendo Switch successor or an Xbox handheld, which Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said is in early testing. However, the PlayStation handheld is likely years away from an announcement even if it makes it to production. So nothing is guaranteed.

Title: Bear Market Here? $0.14 Altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) Grabs Attention While Altcoins Like Cardano and Polkadot Bleed

In the ongoing correction, Bitcoin has dropped below $92,000 from its peak of $108,388. Many analysts are discussing whether this correction will end soon or continue as a bear market. Though well-known coins like Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) have experienced significant price drops, crypto experts believe this is just a profit booking from last month’s recent bull run. With the expectation of a bottom soon, savvy traders are searching for the next great opportunity, combining innovation, strong fundamentals, and exponential price rallies. The $0.14 altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) has attracted crypto whales and institutions because of its massive upside potential and innovative leadership quality in the exchange market. Cardano (ADA) has been one of the leaders in the crypto market due to its strategic importance, standards, and rapid developments in the ecosystem. In November’s rally, it surged 216%, climbing above the $1 psychological mark. However, the profit booking has been severe as the Cardano (ADA) price has dropped 36% from the peak. It is currently trying to stabilize itself above the lower band of the descending wedge pattern. The wedge pattern is a historical formation. The previous leg could continue if Cardano (ADA) breaks the local resistance of the pattern. The recent decline in the ADA price results from shifting sentiment from large-cap to low-cap coins. To reverse the price action in Cardano (ADA), the project’s strategic partnership and interest should see growth in the coming months. Polkadot saw a sharp drop of over 25% in the last month of the year, settling around the $6.5 mark with a 19.34% loss. Despite this, several factors position DOT as one of the top cryptos to consider. Community sentiment on CoinMarketCap stands at an impressive 88% bullish, with analysts offering a positive outlook for its future. One potential driver for Polkadot’s price growth is its new ability to connect with other blockchain networks. This connection on Polkadot, powered by Hyperbridge, allows users to transfer assets seamlessly across chains without intermediaries. DTX Exchange (DTX) is making a mark in the DeFi world with its advanced and first hybrid trading platform, attracting users globally. By pioneering the integration of multi-asset trading, experts believe DTX could revolutionize the trading industry and take over major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. It offers 120,000+ asset classes and increased buying capacity up to 1,000x for larger market positions. This allows traders to diversify their portfolios and enhance their profitability efficiently. The platform has a no-KYC policy, enabling full platform access without revealing identity. With the platform’s advanced analytical tools, traders can analyze a large amount of data to identify potential market opportunities. Features like algorithmic trading help them automate any strategy to capture sudden price movements. Due to its unique capabilities, the recent Phoenix Wallet launch has skyrocketed in demand. This wallet provides a secure custody solution for stocks, cryptos, and forex and offers low interest rates and fees. In the 7th presale stage, DTX has over 380,000 active wallet addresses and raised over $11.2 million in record time. Analysts predict the price could surge from $0.14 to $14, presenting 100x gains. Industry experts predict that the DTX Exchange will soon hit the exchanges and will be a solid competitor to Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT), which have both seen tremendous profits in the past.

If you believe in the work we do at Vox, please support us by becoming a member. Our mission has never been more urgent. But our work isn’t easy. It requires resources, dedication, and independence. And that’s where you come in. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? From tariffs and a Trump/Elon break-up to artificial general intelligence, here’s what could happen in 2025, according to the Future Perfect team. by Dylan Matthews, Bryan Walsh, Marina Bolotnikova, Kenny Torrella, Izzie Ramirez, and Dylan Scott For the sixth year in a row, the staff of Future Perfect convened in December to make predictions about major events in the year to come. Will Congress pass a tariff bill that makes President-elect Donald Trump happy? Will the H5N1 bird flu become an honest-to-god pandemic? Will the war in Ukraine stop? Will a major sports figure get caught up in a gambling scandal? It’s fun to make predictions about the future, which is part of the reason why we do it so often. But this isn’t just blind guessing. Each prediction comes with a probability attached to it. That gives you a sense of our confidence (high in the case of, say, Charli XCX’s Grammy chances, less so in the case of Iran’s nuclear plans). And don’t make the same mistake that people seem to make every presidential cycle. Even a probability as high as 75 percent or 80 percent doesn’t mean we’re sure something will happen. Rather, it means we think that if we made four or five predictions, we’d expect three or four of them to come true, respectively. And as we have every year, we’ll be keeping track of how our predictions fared over the course of 2025, and report back to you at the end of December. You can check out how we did in 2024 here. And we’ve done something new this year in partnering with the prediction platform Metaculus. You can check it out here to see how the community there came down on a number of our predictions — and even compete in a prize pool — and click on the individual questions with links to go directly to them on Metaculus. We’ve also added the Metaculus community’s aggregated forecasts as of December 31 for the questions they’ve taken on. —Bryan Walsh Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign was perhaps the most pro-tariff of any candidate since William McKinley: He promised 60 percent taxes on imports from China, and 10 percent on everywhere else. In victory he’s only gotten bolder, calling for 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, in flagrant violation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade deal made by some past president named Donald Trump. The bad news for consumers and the world economy is that Trump has substantial discretion to impose tariffs as president without consulting Congress. But that discretion isn’t unlimited, and probably doesn’t permit the kind of 10 percent across-the-board tariff Trump promised. Plus, Republicans want a revenue source to help offset the cost of making Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent before they expire at the end of next year. This raises the question: Will Congress pass a tariff measure on its own that not only implements Trump’s ideas, but lets them endure under future presidents? My guess is no. There was a time in the distant past, let’s call it “2015,” when Republicans were the party of free markets and free trade, and some members of Congress haven’t forgotten that. Early reporting suggests that many GOP figures in the House and Senate are hostile to the idea of including tariffs in a tax package. Republicans can only lose three senators and two House members out of their caucus and still pass bills, which gives them very little margin for error, and makes it very difficult to pass legislation that splits the caucus like tariffs. Two caveats, though. One, I’m predicting about a tariff bill and not new unilateral tariffs from Trump because I think the odds that Trump does new tariffs using presidential authority are nearly 100 percent. Two, the only reason my estimate isn’t lower is that there’s been some bipartisan interest in a “carbon border adjustment,” or a sort of carbon tax that only applies to imported goods. The idea has gotten Republican support because while it does acknowledge that global warming is real, it also sticks it to foreigners. That’s a tariff, and I think the likeliest kind to make it into a tax package (though I still bet against it). —Dylan Matthews Metaculus aggregated forecast: 7 percent Something I love and hate about American politics is that big weighty-seeming questions, like “Can Donald Trump fulfill his campaign promise to abolish the Department of Education?” turn out to hinge on much weirder and more technical questions, like “Will the Senate parliamentarian rule a departmental reorganization as ineligible for the reconciliation process under the Byrd rule?” The Department of Education, whose main duties are administering student loans and financial aid for higher-ed institutions and distributing funds (around $39 billion in 2023) to local schools under programs like Title I (for poor districts) and IDEA (for disabled students), was created in a 1979 act of Congress. Passing a normal bill repealing that act would require 60 Senate votes to break a filibuster, which means winning over seven Democrats to the idea, which isn’t going to happen. So legislation abolishing the department (already written by GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota) would have to pass through budget reconciliation, which lets certain legislation pass with a mere majority in the Senate. But reconciliation has strict requirements limiting the content of legislation that can be passed that way, and in particular provisions of bills that are only “incidentally” related to the overall level of spending or taxing tend to be struck down by the Senate parliamentarian as contrary to the Byrd rule, the main governing principle behind the reconciliation process. Rounds’s bill, notably, doesn’t eliminate the Department of Education’s actual functions. It just moves them around. Student loans, for instance, would go to the Treasury Department, and the Department of Labor would get vocational programs. This strikes me as an archetypal example of a change that is merely incidental to the actual level of spending, and that can’t be done with reconciliation. Will the Senate parliamentarian disagree with me? Possibly. But also, in part because this move is so much more about reorganization than the actual substance of the department’s programs, I am very skeptical that Republicans are going to go to the mat on this one. If they can only win so many fights with the parliamentarian, are they going to prioritize changing the mailing address of the student loan office? I doubt it. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 4 percent From the moment the Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010, the Republican Party has been obsessed with repealing it. They even shut down the government over it. Then, in 2017, the dog finally caught the car: Republicans had both houses of Congress and the presidency, and in theory the opportunity to repeal the law. They didn’t. Sure, the tax law that year eliminated the individual mandate to get health insurance, but that turned out to not be as important to getting people coverage as the ACA’s authors thought. The rest of the bill — its dramatic Medicaid expansions, rules protecting people with preexisting conditions and letting young adults stay on their parents’ insurance, subsidies for individuals to buy health insurance if their employer doesn’t provide it — remained intact. Even “skinny repeal,” a bill that zeroed out only a handful of provisions of the law, failed to pass the Senate when John McCain made his famous thumbs-down gesture, but matters had only even gotten to that point because several other senators didn’t want to vote for sweeping Medicaid cuts, like those entailed by simply repealing the ACA in its entirety. Will they try again in 2025? I’m skeptical. And here, by “repeal Obamacare,” I don’t even necessarily mean repealing all of it. To qualify as repeal, a bill has to do at least three of the following five things: Yes, Trump’s budgets and those that his past and future budget chief Russ Vought prepared during the Biden years did propose undoing the ACA’s coverage expansions, and then cutting Medicaid still further. I anticipate they will continue to make these proposals. But I am doubtful that with a much narrower House majority than they had in 2017, and an equally narrow Senate majority, Republicans will be able to pass cuts on a scale that they couldn’t get off the ground eight years ago. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 10 percent Here are the facts: Jerome Powell’s term as chair of the Federal Reserve expires on May 15, 2026. He has pledged to stay on as chair until that time, though not necessarily to remain as a member of the Board of Governors until his term there expires in 2028. Donald Trump has said he does not plan to fire Powell before that time. Powell has insisted that the president does not legally have the power to fire him before his term is up, and that he will refuse to obey such an order. In many ways, 10 percent seems too high, because the odds that a 71-year-old man dies in the next year are only 2.9 percent, and I have an easier time envisioning Powell dying in office than acquiescing to a firing. But I should also fess up to a personal bias here. Jay Powell is, by a wide margin, the greatest chair of the Federal Reserve that the institution has ever had, and perhaps the greatest central banker in any nation of modern times. He prevented Covid from spiraling into a global financial crisis, oversaw an astonishingly rapid recovery of employment and economic growth in the pandemic’s aftermath, and managed a “soft landing” that ended an inflationary episode without having to spark a recession. He is a miraculous figure who we do not deserve, and for my own sanity I need him to stick around. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 8 percent Americans have a charming habit of deciding to like the newly elected president as soon as the election’s over, and Donald Trump’s favorability rating has gone from 8.6 points underwater on Election Day to only 1.9 points negative on December 19. (By “favorability rating,” I mean the difference between the share of voters saying they view him favorably minus the share saying they view him unfavorably. Once he’s president, I’ll count this prediction as resolving to “true” if either his favorability or job approval ratings are positive; while similar, these aren’t exactly the same question.) But how long do presidential “honeymoon” periods last? Not very long, as it turns out. Back in 2022, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Jean Yi crunched the data and found that Obama, Trump I, and Biden alike all saw their approval ratings dip below 50 percent by the end of the first year (Trump was never even above 50 when he started!): The two exceptions on the chart are Bill Clinton, who saw a curious fall and then recovery over 1993 that I don’t really understand, and George W. Bush, whose first year included 9/11. I think the odds of another 9/11 are mercifully low, and the trend appears to be toward lower approval for presidents in their first year in recent times. Moreover, Trump is unusually loathed by a huge segment of the population and is promising massive tariffs that I suspect will prove unpopular once they start raising the prices of everyday household items. So I feel pretty good predicting Trump will be below water at year’s end. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 17 percent “Still friends” is obviously a subjective category but I like the prediction markets guru Nathan Young’s proposed definition: if one or the other publicly and unambiguously disparages his counterpart at least three times. Luckily for us, Trump and Musk are not subtle or taciturn men, and when they dislike someone they have a tendency to scream that loudly many, many times, so I don’t anticipate it being hard to decide where they stand at the end of 2025. The list of one-time Trump allies who eventually came to denounce him is too long to include in full here, but let us briefly remember, say, 10: Anthony Scaramucci; Mike Pence; John Kelly; John Bolton; HR McMaster; Stephanie Grisham; Alyssa Farah Griffin; Betsy DeVos; and of course Michael Cohen. It does not seem like an ambitious prediction that Musk will eventually join their ranks. His role as the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency seems guaranteed to put him on a collision course with Trump’s Cabinet officials and with congressional Republicans, and probably also with his cochair Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump might side with Musk each time — but he’s always been more pragmatic about spending policy than the cut-happy Musk seems, and there are ripe opportunities for conflict. What if Musk wants to slash Medicare and Social Security, which Trump has promised to defend? What if he wants defense cuts and Trump wants a tougher posture toward China? What if Musk pushes for reconciliation with China, with whose government he is extremely close (Ramaswamy once called Musk “a circus monkey” working for Xi Jinping)? I won’t predict the exact inciting episode that causes Trump and Musk to fall out. But I feel like I know how these guys operate, and I think it’s more likely than not that they will fall out. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 35 percent Last year, I correctly predicted that more than 40,000 Americans would be killed by cars in 2023 (according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s estimates, which are released with a lag the following year). Since the 1960s, the US has seen rapid, dramatic progress in cutting its car fatality rate, and 2007 was the last year that over 40,000 Americans were killed by our car-dependent transportation system — until the Covid-19 pandemic. You would think that fewer people driving would mean fewer car crash deaths, but not so in America, where our dangerously designed roads lead to more speeding and death when there’s less traffic. Ever since, America’s rate of death by cars has sat at levels that should honestly be humiliating for such a rich country. These numbers are slowly starting to come back down. NHTSA recently estimated that for the first half of 2024, car crash deaths were down 3.2 percent from 2023. If the same trend from 2023 carries over to the second half of 2024, total 2024 car fatalities will come in at a hair under 40,000. It’s far from guaranteed, because car crash patterns vary significantly across different seasons. And that number would still be nothing to write home about — but in a country so thoroughly built around automobiles, getting deaths back under 40,000 would be a milestone worth celebrating. —Marina Bolotnikova Metaculus aggregated forecast: 81 percent What a difference a year makes. In December 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was incredibly unpopular, his image severely damaged by his government’s total failure to anticipate the deadly October 7 attacks by Hamas. Polls indicated his Likud party might win only 17 of 120 seats in Israel’s Knesset. Israel was on its way to becoming an international pariah because of the destructive way it was waging its war in Gaza, and Israelis were furious about the government’s failure to rescue the hostages held by Hamas, even after a November 2023 deal to bring some home. Oh, and Netanyahu was only a few months removed from massive street protests and was facing corruption charges. Fast-forward to December 2024, and polls suggest Netanyahu’s Likud party would win 25 seats if elections were held today, more than any other party. Israel has all but destroyed Hezbollah, by far its most capable opponent, and has isolated Iran, arguably its most existential threat. After the sudden fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, Israel has even captured territory formerly under the Syrian government’s control. And President Joe Biden, who at least occasionally pushed back against Netanyahu, is about to be replaced by President-elect Donald Trump, who has signaled that he will happily give Israel a freer hand in Gaza. Netanyahu has been prime minister of Israel for roughly 17 of the past 28 years. Every time it seems like he’s in an unwinnable position, he seems to find a way to wriggle out of it. I have every expectation that will continue in 2025. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 75 percent Americans got pretty upset about inflation in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, but we’ve got nothing on our Argentinian friends: Here in the US, we’re such babies that we’ll complain about 6 percent to 7 percent inflation. In Argentina, double-digit annual inflation rates were normal even before the pandemic. Annual inflation hit triple digits and started what looked like an exponential climb, still ongoing when left-wing Peronist Alberto Fernández left office. Javier Milei, a chainsaw-wielding self-described anarcho-capitalist who named his dogs after the libertarian economists Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard, and Robert Lucas, initiated shock therapy upon taking office this year, eliminating price controls and subsidies for things like fuel and food, as well as massively devaluing the peso. That made prices surge even more massively at first (which you can see in the chart above). But since then they’ve been subsiding. The price surge had the salutary effect of easing the government’s debt burden, and the nation’s budget went into surplus for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. This has come at a considerable cost, with poverty and unemployment spiking, and the economy as a whole in recession for much of the year. But now that the recession is over and the country is seeing both cooling inflation and a growing economy, a sadly unusual combo down in Buenos Aires. That said, I don’t think we’re going to see the country get down to a 30 percent annual inflation rate in 2024. The 12-month inflation rate in November 2024 was 166 percent, down 27 points from the month before. If the rate keeps falling at that pace, the country will hit the 30 percent mark in five months. But I think progress against inflation will slow as the initial shock of Milei’s policies subsides and pressure for wage hikes intensifies in a country that’s finally growing again. The IMF anticipates annual inflation hitting a low of 45 percent next year, and I think that’s a reasonable guess. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 55 percent The war in Ukraine is just short of its third anniversary. The very fact that Ukraine has continued to fight this long defies most early prognosticators, many of whom expected the government in Kyiv to collapse not long after the Russians invaded. (An exception there, as Future Perfect readers know, is the State Department’s perspicacious Bureau of Intelligence and Research.) But the longer the war goes on, the more Russia’s sheer size and willingness to sacrifice unbelievable numbers of soldiers has outweighed Ukraine’s ability to fight back, even with the material support of the US and European allies. President Biden has mostly been a steadfast ally, but he’ll be leaving office on January 20, replaced by Donald Trump, who has made no secret of the fact that he has little interest in continuing to support Ukraine. Both sides are still fighting hard to gain and protect territory, but it seems clear that’s being done by both Ukraine and Russia to put themselves in the best possible position before expected peace talks. Exactly what form that will take is difficult to predict, and a ceasefire doesn’t mean a permanent peace. But I would be shocked to not see a durable pause in the fighting some time in 2025. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 44 percent For the purposes of this prediction, “getting nuclear weapons” means producing enough fissile material to fuel a nuclear weapon. Actually producing a usable nuclear weapon — including miniaturizing a warhead enough to fit on a missile — might take another several months to a year or more, and thus probably falls outside the 2025 time frame. Iran is already on the brink of sufficient enrichment — estimates are that it would only take about a week for Iran to enrich enough uranium for five fission weapons. So the question here is primarily one of international politics. Iran had a terrible 2024. It directly attacked Israel with missiles twice, only to see both salvos largely neutralized by missile defense systems, while Israel’s own retaliatory attack on Iran was far more successful. The Lebanese militia Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful proxy, was all but annihilated by Israel, which continues to operate in parts of southern Lebanon. And the return of Donald Trump brings a president into office whom Iran has been accused of trying to assassinate. Put that all together, and the Iranian regime finds itself in a very insecure place, and may look to nuclear weapons as a way to level the playing field. At the same time, relatively new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has made overtures to the West and seems to understand that the only path to economic relief for his country is a new deal that limits the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. The Iranian regime’s number one priority is its own survival, and my best guess is that they will decide that the risk of going full speed on a nuclear program isn’t worth it, at least for another year. (There’s also the possibility that accelerating its nuclear work could lead to a military intervention by Israel or the US that would stop the program in its tracks.) So I think on balance that Iran won’t join the nuclear club in 2025 — though it’s not a prediction I make with a great deal of certainty. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 8 percent First off, some math. While it may feel as if infectious disease pandemics have become a regular occurrence, they still remain highly rare. Since 1918, there have been five influenza pandemics: the Spanish flu of that year, the 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu, the 1977 Russian flu, and the 2009 swine flu. That gives a naive percentage of about 5 percent for any given year. But there’s evidence that outbreaks of new infectious diseases are increasing, as the Covid pandemic amply demonstrated. And the H5N1 avian flu has been infecting a growing variety and number of animals, and more recently, people. On December 18, California, where 34 human cases of the virus have been detected, became the first state to institute a state of emergency over bird flu. New research suggests just a single mutation could be enough to potentially increase the virus’s ability to spread from person to person, which would be a prerequisite to becoming a pandemic. (Right now, H5N1 only rarely seems to be able to spread between people, and only in very limited fashion.) So why am I mostly pessimistic about H5N1’s ability to truly break out, which for the purposes of this prediction would mean the WHO officially declaring it a pandemic, which would require sustained human transmission over multiple regions? Not because we’re doing a great job containing it — we definitely are not. Rather, it’s personal experience. I’ve been covering H5N1 since it began really spilling over in Southeast Asia in 2004. I’ve been to backyard chicken farms in Indonesia and virology labs in Hong Kong. I’ve watched this virus as closely as any other subject I’ve covered in nearly a quarter-century as a professional journalist, and I just don’t think H5N1 has it. Call it a hunch, and one I hope will hold true. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 26 percent For precision, let me clarify that by “major lab” I mean any of the following companies: This is a purposefully broad list and includes companies that haven’t made it a priority to be on the bleeding edge of deep learning (like Netflix) and ones whose primary business isn’t in developing their own models so much as hosting or enabling models that others create (like Scale or Hugging Face). But, you know, I thought Nvidia wasn’t in this race until it dropped a massive model in October with impressive benchmarks, so a lot of things can change quickly in the world of AI. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a vague term, and there is a large and growing literature in which AI researchers seek merely to define it, let alone to predict what it would look like or mean. That said, most definitions rely on an analogy to humans: an AI will be generally intelligent if it can do everything a human being can do, as well as a human being can, including meta-tasks like learning to complete new tasks. This idea itself has holes in it. Different human beings can do different things — I cannot do everything, say, Katie Ledecky can do. Luckily for us, the prediction here doesn’t require us to know what AGI means. It just requires a major firm to claim to have achieved it, accurately or not. One OpenAI staffer took to X this past year to claim that the firm’s models had already gotten there (though, importantly, the company itself has not made claims that grand). So if the bar is that low, why do I think we’ll make it through the year without a company making this claim? Mostly because a) this is a young field where firm reputation matters a ton and being discredited by a premature AGI announcement might make the difference between a company ending up like Apple and ending up like Atari, and b) this is the kind of technology where premature claims can be discredited really, really fast. If a nuclear fusion company claims to have achieved net energy gain, it is very difficult for me, a non-nuclear physicist, to tell if they’re bluffing. It’s not like I can use the nuclear reactor. But an AGI would presumably come with text, video, audio, and other interfaces that average consumers could try out and use, and it’d be immediately clear if some AI firm claimed to have gotten there when they hadn’t. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 20 percent I’m not really a fan of private cars (see my other car-related prediction above), and I wish our solution to climate change was to just have fewer of them. But this is America, so we have to work within the maddeningly car-dependent cage of our own creation. Electric cars are obviously better for society in most respects (though not all — their heavy weight means they’re more dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists, and anyone outside the vehicle), so I grudgingly have to welcome the EV transition that’s finally picking up. By the third quarter of 2024, EVs made up 8.9 percent of new car sales in the US, according to an analysis by Kelley Blue Book. There’ve been reports that electric car sales are slowing, but given their consistent past growth rates, plus the fact that interest rates are coming down, I think we’ll hit 10 percent by the same time this year without much trouble. Donald Trump’s promise to do sweeping tariffs could throw a wrench in all that, but given my colleague Dylan Matthews’s prediction about the unlikelihood of that happening, I won’t calibrate my prediction around it too much. —MB Metaculus aggregated forecast: 67 percent The digital gold rush probably still hasn’t reached full frenzy, believe it or not. Bitcoin recently topped $100,000 in value for the first time, but we are going to have to think bigger. I think it’s going to double its value in the next 12 months — and I’m not the only one. This is not an endorsement, to be clear; I own no bitcoin. When I read Warren Buffett still believes Bitcoin is a fad, that people do “stupid things” and this will be the latest trend in fiscal speculation to end in failure, I take it seriously. The case for bitcoin remains muddied, at least to me. But Buffett has also compared bitcoin to gambling and, well, the gambling business is booming. Even if Bitcoin is a questionable long-term investment — don’t forget it dropped below $20,000 in late 2022 — people can still get a kick out of the continued accumulation of value, and that’s the basis of any bubble. It helps that Donald Trump and the crew he’s bringing back to Washington have gone all in on the crypto craze; they are likely to do whatever they can to stoke the speculation further. Bitcoin just saw its value more than double over the course of 2024. I think it’s more likely than not it’ll repeat the feat with those winds at its back. —Dylan Scott Metaculus aggregated forecast: 20 percent My source here is the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Since the 2012 inception of the Bloomberg list, the occupant of the top spot has changed five times. In 2013, surging Microsoft shares enabled Bill Gates to beat out Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim, who led the list at its outset. In 2017, Amazon shares put Jeff Bezos ahead of Gates. The massive rally around Tesla led in January 2021 to Elon Musk deposing Bezos. But Louis Vuitton chief Bernard Arnault overtook him in October 2022 in part because Musk had to sell much of his Tesla fortune to finance his purchase of Twitter. But by May of the following year, Musk was back on top. “Will Elon Musk still be the richest person in the world throughout 2024?” is actually two separate questions: one, will he be dethroned by anyone in the next year; two, will he live through the year? Normally the latter wouldn’t be a concern for a 53-year-old man with access to the best health care money can buy, but Musk is, uh, not the most stable person on earth. So I’d put maybe a 5 percent probability he loses the title by way of the Grim Reaper. Five switches in the top ranking over 12.5 years of the Bloomberg ranking existing implies, naively, a 40 percent chance that the top rank will switch in any given year. There’s tons of fluctuation within the top 10 even in a given month, as these net worths are hugely dependent on stock returns. Jensen Huang of Nvidia, currently ranked 12th, gained $73.4 billion in 2024 alone, by far the biggest part of his $117 billion fortune. It’s sobering to return to the 2013 article on Gates overtaking Slim, which notes at the bottom an up-and-comer named Elon Musk, whose car company brought him up to a net worth of $5.4 billion. Today, it’s $455 billion. Life moves pretty fast. Anyway, 40 percent odds that Musk is overtaken by another billionaire plus 5 percent odds he dies = 45 percent odds that he is no longer the richest man, and 55 percent odds that he still is. One exception to my policy of relying on Bloomberg here: hilariously, Bloomberg refuses to include Michael Bloomberg in its ranking, but should Bloomberg, LP’s value surge or Mike otherwise become the richest person in the world according to the Forbes World’s Billionaire List or some other reliable source, I’ll consider Musk dethroned, even if Bloomberg itself refuses to report on its leader’s riches. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast; 85 percent Last year was an eventful one in the saga of psychedelics seeking a return to mainstream medicine. Roughly 38 years of planning came to a head when Lykos Therapeutics — a for-profit outgrowth of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, founded in 1986 — submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MDMA therapy to treat PTSD. Despite widespread expectations it would succeed, the FDA did not grant approval, unsettling psychedelic companies, advocates, and the industry at large. The FDA didn’t outright reject the application, but asked for another Phase 3 clinical trial, which will likely take a couple of years to complete and resubmit to the FDA. With Lykos going back to the drawing board, who’s going to take the next swing at FDA approval? My prediction: no one, at least not in 2025. At the moment, there aren’t many other companies with Phase 3 trials underway. Two of the closest behind Lykos are in the midst of trials looking at psilocybin to treat depression — Compass Pathways and the Usona Institute. Compass launched its trial in January 2023, but delayed a top-line readout of its results and cut 30 percent of its staff after the FDA’s decision on Lykos. They don’t expect to complete the study until February of 2026. Usona launched its Phase 3 trial in March 2024 and doesn’t anticipate completing the study — let alone putting together a new drug application and submitting it to the FDA — until April 2026. We certainly won’t see any companies announce a Phase 3 trial, complete it, and package the findings into an application to the FDA all within the span of one year. So it’s difficult to imagine any pathway toward an FDA approval in 2025. There are still some slightly cracked backdoors that could usher psilocybin into accepted medical use within the year, like the FDA granting an emergency use authorization, which could even force the holy grail of a true psychedelic renaissance — rescheduling it to a lower category of the Controlled Substances Act — before getting FDA approval. So while I think the chances of normal FDA approval in 2025 are basically zero, considering the EUA backdoor, plus the general state of accelerating weirdness of the world these days, bumps my estimate up to 20 percent that we wind up with any federally authorized medical use of a new psychedelic drug in 2025. —Oshan Jarow Metaculus aggregated forecast: 33 percent I just wrote a long story about why the concept of “ultra-processed foods” is kind of BS — it’s overly broad, arbitrary, and even liable to vilify foods that are good for us. It does not make sense as a policymaking tool. The scientific panel that’s advising the creation of the 2025–2030 federal dietary guidelines, due out this year, acknowledged as much in December, when it concluded that there’s not much reliable evidence linking ultra-processed foods to poor health outcomes. The final dietary guidelines, which are jointly created by the US Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services and play an important role in shaping federal nutrition programs like National School Lunch, often aren’t fully aligned with the scientific committee’s recommendations. But where they differ, it’s often to benefit powerful food industries, like the meat industry and producers of sugary snacks. And a sweeping recommendation against ultra-processed foods would be consistent with neither nutrition science nor corporate interests. So whatever the hype about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cracking down on ultra-processed foods, I expect the final document to come to more or less the same conclusion as the science. —MB Most of the antibiotics used in human medicine are actually sold to meat companies, which put them in animals’ feed to make them grow faster and prevent disease outbreaks in factory farms. But some bacteria on farms are becoming resistant to these antibiotics, giving way to new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that make the drugs less effective in treating humans. It’s a huge public health threat, and experts have warned that we ought to rein in antibiotic use in the meat industry. Last year, I predicted that livestock antibiotics sales would increase by 2 percent in 2023, but instead, they declined by 1 percent. (Data on sales lags by about a year.) I erred in giving too much weight to past trends, as antibiotic sales to the livestock industry had been on the rise for years. Instead, I should’ve used projected meat production as a rough proxy for livestock antibiotic sales. Doing so this time around, antibiotic sales to meat producers should have increased in 2024 by around 0.83 percent, given that beef production is expected to remain stable, pork production will increase by a few percentage points, and turkey production will decrease by a few percentage points. There are numerous factors that could result in my guesstimate being off, such as disease prevalence and corporations reducing antibiotic use due to consumer pressure. For the sake of safeguarding one of humanity’s greatest inventions — antibiotics — I hope I’m wrong. —Kenny Torrella Metaculus aggregated forecast: 50 percent Since early 2022, 112 million poultry birds — mostly turkeys and egg-laying hens — have been violently killed in an effort to slow the spread of a bird flu outbreak that has roiled the poultry industry for nearly three years now. The first year was the worst, with almost 58 million birds killed. Things slowed down a bit in 2023, with 21.8 million poultry birds dead, but then worsened in 2024, with 41 million birds killed as of mid-December. I predict at least another 30 million will die in 2025. It’s incredibly difficult to make predictions for such an unpredictable disease, so I’m pegging my confidence level at a meek 60 percent. But it’s reasonable to think that the Trump administration will handle the situation in a similarly poor fashion to the Biden administration’s bungled, industry-friendly response, allowing the virus to circulate freely among livestock and wildlife. The US Department of Agriculture has been testing vaccines for poultry birds and dairy cows. However, it’s unclear when they’ll be ready and, more importantly, whether they’ll be deployed, because using them could disrupt trade, and both industry and the USDA don’t want that to happen. —KT Metaculus aggregated forecast: 96 percent For six years, the US pork industry has been looking for a way to get rid of California’s Proposition 12, a landmark animal welfare law, passed by ballot measure in 2018, that outlawed certain forms of extreme confinement on factory farms. That included a ban on the sale of pork raised using gestation crates — tiny cages in which pregnant pigs are kept continually, barely given any room to move. The practice, as we wrote last year, is “equivalent to living your entire, short life pregnant and trapped inside a coffin.” Having failed to convince courts, including the US Supreme Court, of their legal arguments for overturning the law, pork giants are now trying to get Congress to nullify Prop 12 through the Farm Bill, a massive legislative package passed every five years that shapes much of US food and farming policy. Last May, the House Agriculture Committee advanced a Republican-led Farm Bill that includes just such a measure. Always live to serve. At the time, I didn’t think this version of the bill would go anywhere. This year, Congress will need to finally pass the long-delayed Farm Bill, and with a majority in both chambers, Republicans’ chances of axing Prop 12 will be much greater. Still, I don’t really see it happening, in part because some members of the Freedom Caucus oppose it as a severe limit on states’ ability to set their own policies. Much like their long-promised efforts to trash the Affordable Care Act, Republicans love to talk about repealing stuff but rarely follow through. —MB Metaculus aggregated forecast: 78 percent Earlier this year, Florida and Alabama banned the production and sale of “lab-grown” or “cell-cultivated” meat. Cell-cultivated meat is real meat but made without slaughtering animals — instead, startups take animal cells, place them in a large steel tank, and feed them a mix of ingredients, like sugars, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids, for several weeks until they can be harvested as meat. The bans were transparent efforts to protect the respective states’ livestock industries and score political points by further pulling meat into America’s culture war. It’s a somewhat hollow victory for the culture warriors and red state governors — cell-cultivated meat is still incredibly expensive to produce and has only been sold in small batches for limited runs at a handful of US restaurants. It’s an emerging technology, and there’s still uncertainty as to whether the startups that make it will be able to scale their operations to produce a meaningful amount of meat. But if they do figure it out, these bans could be a real headache in the future, both for the companies’ bottom lines and America’s climate goals, as cell-cultivated meat has potential to cut agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, lawmakers in other states are lining up behind Florida and Alabama to pass their own bans, including in Arizona, Michigan, Tennessee, and Illinois. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said he plans to work with state lawmakers to introduce a ban in the next legislative session. I think the likelihood that at least one of these states passes a ban is high, and especially in Nebraska, as Pillen is one of the nation’s largest pork producers and has railed against meat alternatives. While it won’t affect the cell-cultivated meat startups much in the short term, it would contribute to political hostility that could spell doom in the long run. —KT Metaculus aggregated forecast: 85 percent The evidence is adding up that the widespread legalization of gambling has been, at best, reckless. Putting a casino on the phones everyone carries around in their pocket has created social and economic harms that need to be taken seriously, before a deeper crisis sets in. It is a world that is unthinkable to me, as somebody who grew up in the shadow of the Pete Rose scandal. Whatever you think of Pete Rose the person, the all-time hits leader is not in the Baseball Hall of Fame because his gambling was regarded as a violation of the game’s most important values. Today, Major League Baseball airs on the FanDuel Sports Network in my area and the biggest name in sports media, ESPN, runs its own sportsbook. Only scandal could break the spell, right? But the truth is, we have already seen a series of sports betting scandals since the 2018 Supreme Court decision that unlocked this new era of gambling. NFL wide receiver Calvin Ridley lost a year of his young career to a gambling-related suspension. One NBA bench player was banned from the league for giving tips to gamblers and allegedly altering his play based on bets. But those players were not All-Stars, much less household names. We have not yet had a player of the caliber of LeBron James or Patrick Mahomes implicated by gambling allegations. But we have come close. Last year, National League MVP Shohei Ohtani of the MLB’s Los Angeles Dodgers was ensnared when his personal trainer faced criminal charges related to his gambling, though Ohtani was ultimately found not to be involved. It seems only a matter of time until a major sports star faces a serious gambling scandal. I don’t know if this will be the year. It may not be. But I’m confident the next Pete Rose is already out there. —DS Metaculus aggregated forecast: 15 percent Listen, the four-time world champ has grown on me a lot. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has proven his dominance on the track over and over again, but with Lewis Hamilton (who has won seven times!) moving over to Scuderia Ferrari, I’m not so sure anymore. Plus, there’s McLaren’s Lando Norris, who had a hell of a car this previous season. I’m not a Lando enjoyer, but it’s undeniable that he’s inching closer and closer to being a challenger for the title. All that said, my prediction is that Max will win the drivers’ championship, but Red Bull will lose the constructors’ again. —Izzie Ramirez I’ve been a Charli stan since her Sucker and No. 1 Angel days, and it’s been absolutely wild watching her become a household name. Brat was as much a cultural phenomenon as it was the defining sound of the summer (and many political memes), with the album’s garish green becoming a shorthand for what’s cool. It appeared at the very top of year-end lists from publications like Metacritic and the New York Times — I’d be absolutely shocked if it didn’t win for album of the year. But I’m going to be intentionally open for this prediction: “360,” “Apple,” or the “Guess” remix featuring 2024 Future Perfect 50 honoree Billie Eilish are all also contenders in their respective song categories. Now if only the Academy could retroactively give Charli an award for her actual best song… —IR Clarification, January 2, 2025, 10:25 am ET: This story has been clarified to adjust the wording of two questions and the probabilities of the predictions to match those in Metaculus.

December 31, 2024 16:50 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on January 10, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective January 13, 2025: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above, while the per Share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price will be approximately twenty-times higher. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on January 13, 2025. The Fund’s total market value, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners.

December 31, 2024 16:50 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on January 10, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective January 13, 2025: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above, while the per Share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price will be approximately twenty-times higher. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on January 13, 2025. The Fund’s total market value, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners.

On Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares slid 2 percent to $134.9 during one low of $135.67 in trading. Trading was very quiet, and the volume was out of 45.6 million shares, less than 10% of the average daily volume of 376.9 million shares. At the close on Friday, the stock finished at $137.49. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. While NVIDIA shares suffered a minor setback, Wall Street analysts are still optimistic that NVIDIA's long-term growth prospects will be strong. Earlier this month, Susquehanna raised its price target on the semiconductor giant from $160 to $180 and maintained its 'positive' rating. TD Cowen also reiterated a "buy" rating with a hike to its price target from $165 to $175. Other firms, among them Truist Financial and The Goldman Sachs Group, also raised their targets after they said they saw strong demand for NVIDIA's products in AI and data center markets. Da Davidson, however, was more measured, lifting its price target and putting a 'neutral' rating on the stock. NVIDIA ranked Moderately Buy with 39 "buy" ratings, 4 "holds" and 1 "strong buy." It now sets the consensus price target for the stock at $164.15. Despite short term fluctuations, the analysts report that NVIDIA is in a strong position to fuel future growth, with new artificial intelligence, gaming, and enterprise markets making the stock an attractive sell point for longer term investors.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on NVIDIA (NVDA): The King of AI GPUs Under Pressure

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. As 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven’t been so lucky. As an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks while the second ranks 12th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world’s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period. So why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company. However, while the GPU maker hasn’t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm’s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn’t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion. But an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock’s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren’t impressed and they weren’t optimistic about the firm’s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO’s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention. The start of December has also seen another interesting, albeit long-term, development for the semiconductor industry. The semiconductors, or chips, that currently power our computers and phones rely on classical computing which uses bits for computing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, expands the processing power significantly over classical computing by relying on qubits instead. In December, Google revealed its Willow quantum computing chip which it claims is capable of processing a problem that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. More importantly, Google claimed to have manufactured the chip itself – a development that broadens the number of companies capable of manufacturing advanced processors. The announcement injected fresh life into quantum computing stocks which have gained as much as 281% since Willow was revealed. This is despite the fact that no semiconductor foundry is capable of manufacturing quantum computing chips at scale. And why would they? After all, the use cases for quantum computers are limited as well, as opposed to the billions of chips used in personal computing applications. For his part, Cramer isn’t a fan of quantum computing either. Commenting on the negative share price movements following the Federal Reserve’s well-televised conference earlier this month, he likened the sentiment in quantum computing to a hype bubble. The market won’t recover quickly according to Cramer as “rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing” pushed stocks higher than their fundamentals would justify. Further commenting on the industry, he stated: “How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible token, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about semiconductor stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-20-24 Performance Since Then: 7.73% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world’s leading AI GPU designer. Since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT, the firm’s shares have gained more than 700%. Yet, since their July peak, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares have added just 1.62% as investors wait to see how its Blackwell GPUs perform and whether any rivals pop up. The stock has also been hit with speculation of rivals stealing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI GPU market share due to supply constraints and high prices. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock dipped by 3% in December after Broadcom shared that it can earn as much as $90 billion in AI revenue by 2027. Here’s what Cramer said about the firm in August: “I almost feel like you can guess it—it’s Nvidia. It’s the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia’s drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, “Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There’s too much pressure on Nvidia—can it sustain it? I don’t want Nvidia to be Samson. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Third in the S&P 500, behind only Palantir (PLTR, Financials) and Vistra Corp., Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financials), a global leader in artificial intelligence and image processing technologies, had its stock increase an incredible 178%. This leap indicates that Nvidia's AI-powered hardware and software solutions are much sought after in a fast changing tech environment. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though Nvidia had an outstanding year, recently its pricing has been rather erratic. From its all-time high in November, the share price dropped 1.3% on December 30. Analysts claim this is a result of individuals profiting and growing concern about the state of the semiconductor business getting more challenging. Currently challenging their 21-day exponential moving average, Nvidia's shares show a technical indication often seen as a potential support level. Regarding the future, CEO Jensen Huang will discuss the "Rubin," next-generation AI processor the business developed at the January 6 Consumer Electronics Show. With the presentation, Nvidia hopes to demonstrate that, in an area increasingly dependent on sophisticated networking technologies, artificial intelligence infrastructure is still under its leadership. Following European Commission clearance of antitrust issues, Nvidia completed its $700 million acquisition of the Israeli artificial intelligence startup Run:ai. The purchase is supposed to increase Nvidia's capacity to handle AI chores, therefore boosting its degree of competition. Run:ai has also indicated they want their software to be open source, therefore benefiting the artificial intelligence field overall. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: Why Nvidia’s (NVDA) China Revenue Is Guaranteed Despite Restrictions

As the US continues to navigate an AI trade war with China, some startling revelations have raised questions about the effectiveness of its semiconductor export controls. According to a report published by The Information, ByteDance is planning to spend as much as $7 billion on buying Nvidia chips in 2025. The US government is yet to react to this revelation, but there’s a good chance they won’t be happy with the Chinese firm’s plans. Since 2022, the United States has placed export restrictions on many advanced semiconductor chips, including Nvidia’s Blackwell predecessor, the Hopper GPUs. Nvidia has circumvented this ban by creating a variant of the H100 GPU called the H800 GPU. This was essentially a dumbed-down version of the most powerful GPU available at the time. Nvidia achieved this by restricting the bandwidth, resulting in reduced communication speed between the GPUs. This helped them comply with export regulations at the time. Chinese companies were happy to receive the H800s. However, they also figured out a new way to get access to Nvidia’s latest chips. If they built a data center in any of their neighboring countries and imported the Nvidia chips there, they could circumvent the export ban. That’s what ByteDance plans to do as well. For context, ByteDance is the owner of Doubao, the most-used AI chatbot in China with 51 million users. The company plans to continue its domination and for that, it is willing to go to great lengths to get its hands on Nvidia’s latest GPUs. So what does this mean for Nvidia? We already know that Nvidia’s China revenue has gone down from 25% of the total revenue to 15% over the last few years. But is it just a case of the missing revenue being diverted to other places and the products still ending up in China? After this development, that seems to be the likely case. This would mean that no matter how China and the US settle their trade disputes, China will, one way or the other, get its hands on Nvidia GPUs. As both countries try to hurt each other financially, Nvidia can come out unscated, or even the winner! Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Dividend stocks are currently in focus as Wall Street analysts expect them to rebound in 2025 amid changing market preferences. Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon expects dividends from S&P 500 companies to increase by 10% in 2025. But which dividend stocks are safe and reliable for long-term investors? Let's turn to a case study for ideas. Earlier this month, a dividend investor shared his income report and milestone on r/Dividends – a discussion board for income investors with more than 644,000 members. He said his average monthly dividend income this year was $1,000. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things. The investor said this income was about 30% more than last year. The investor’s portfolio screenshots showed that his average monthly dividend income was around $978 or $11,742 per year. "I'm quite happy with that!" he added. The 35-year-old investor said his portfolio’s current value was $485,000. He also shared screenshots of his portfolio holdings. Let's take a look at some of his biggest positions. Broadcom Number of Shares: 220 According to the portfolio screenshots he shared, the investor had 220 shares of Broadcom (AVGO), one of his biggest positions. Over the past year, AVGO shares have gained about 113%. Fidelity UCITS SICAV – Fidelity U.S. Equity Income Fund Number of Shares: 4,092 Fidelity U.S. Quality Income UCITS ETF Inc USD (FUSD) was the second-biggest position in the investor’s portfolio in terms of dollar value. Over the past 12 months, the fund has been up 16%. See Also: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Microsoft Number of Shares: 91 Microsoft (MSFT) was another low-yield technology dividend stock in the portfolio that generated about $1,000 per month. In a note, Stifel recently said Microsoft is poised for growth in 2025 due to AI monetization. The firm lifted its price target on MSFT to $525 from $500. Arbor Realty Trust Number of Shares: 2,731 New York-based mortgage REIT Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) has a dividend yield of just over 12%, according to Benzinga Pro. Last month, the company posted third-quarter earnings that came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. British American Tobacco p.l.c. Number of Shares: 932 British American Tobacco plc (BATS) was another high-yield dividend stock in the portfolio. The company has been paying dividends since 1984. Oracle Corporation Number of Shares: 160 Oracle (ORCL) shares were up 62% in 2024 through December 28. However, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. recently downgraded the stock to Sell from Neutral with a $130 price target, citing valuation concerns.

Realty Income Corporation Number of Shares: 420 Realty Income (O), one of the most famous monthly dividend stocks among Redditors, was also a part of the portfolio as the investor had 420 shares of the REIT. Realty Income raised its dividend by 0.2% earlier in December. BlackRock Number of Shares: 19 The investor had 19 shares of Blackrock (BLK) in his portfolio. Earlier this month, Citi said in a note that BlackRock was one of the best asset managers heading into 2025. The firm has a Buy rating on the stock. Altria Group Number of Shares: 358 Tobacco giant Altria (MO) was recently upgraded to Buy from Neutral. Analysts believe the company will benefit under the upcoming Republican administration due to lower corporate taxes, tariffs and strong border controls. Its price target was increased to $65.

Wedbush Securities has identified Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) as main winners of a rise in artificial intelligence investments predicted to define 2025. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Underlying approximately $2 trillion in AI-related capital expenditure over the next three years, analysts headed by Daniel Ives predict a 25% rise in technology company prices for the year. According to the research, leading IT companies will have a good platform thanks to less regulations and more acceptance of powerful artificial intelligence technologies. According to the research, software businesses like Salesforce and Palantir are well suited to gain from the introduction of big language models and generative artificial intelligence technologies. Emphasizing Nvidia's central influence in the AI scene, the analysts characterized the company's processors as essential infrastructure enabling developments in many other sectors. Additionally expected to profit on the rising need for AI-powered solutions are cloud services such those from Microsoft's (MSFT, Financials) Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon's (AMZN, Financials) Amazon Web Services. The research sees such times as chances for investors to build holdings in technology, even while it notes possible difficulties in the form of economic headwinds and geopolitical uncertainty. Described as entering a "consumption phase" in 2025, the wider corporate use of artificial intelligence is likely to propel the sector's growth path even further.

Title: Morris Chang and the Origins of TSMC

Time Published: 2024-12-31T14:58:55Z
Full Content:
If you were making a list of the most important companies in the world, you’d find Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, somewhere very close to the top. It’s one of a tiny handful of companies, along with Intel and Samsung, that can make the most advanced microchips, and it has a commanding lead in that market. TSMC makes the microprocessors and 5G chips for Apple’s iPhones and Macbooks. It makes chips for both Intel and AMD. And it makes the chips for Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon that are powering the AI boom. TSMC is so important that it’s sometimes called Taiwan’s “silicon shield”, the idea being that fear of damaging TSMC might dissuade China from trying to invade Taiwan. TSMC has a fascinating origin story: it was founded in 1985 by Morris Chang, who, after working in the US for Texas Instruments for more than 20 years, was enticed to go to Taiwan and help develop their high-tech industries as head of Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Shortly after Chang arrived, he created TSMC as an ITRI spinoff. Despite the fierce competitiveness of the semiconductor industry and the comparative technological backwardness of Taiwan, within a decade under Chang’s leadership TSMC was making a billion dollars a year, and it continued to grow from there, ultimately becoming the most advanced semiconductor manufacturer on the planet. Given the importance of TSMC, the story of Morris Chang and how he managed to create the company is of obvious interest. And that story has been told, by him, in a two-volume autobiography. The first volume, covering his birth up to his early years at Texas Instruments, was released in 1998. The second volume, which covers the rest of his life up to the present day, was released in November of this year. Unfortunately, both volumes have currently only been published in Chinese. And despite the fact that we live in a world of infinite, free machine translation, and that the founding of TSMC is among the most important events in modern history, nobody seems to have bothered to translate them into English. This is a situation I would describe as “extremely stupid”. So I bought both volumes from a Taiwanese bookstore, and translated them. I experimented with a few different translation methods, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (the LLM I use day to day) and Otranslator (a sketchy Chinese GPT-4o-based translation service that I’ve used before for PDFs). But ultimately what gave the best results, and was also the simplest, was the built-in translation tools in Google Chrome. The translation isn’t great; there’s a lot of language clunkiness and awkward phrasing (though I find that even human translated Chinese often reads pretty awkwardly if it’s not done really well). The machine particularly struggled with translating names, especially English names. It would often translate an English name into a phonetically similar cluster of syllables, or simply a similar-sounding Chinese name. The name “Haggerty” for instance, is variously translated as Hegdi, Haig, Haigidi, Haggard, Hagdi, and Hagrid. But despite these issues, the books were surprisingly readable, and I found Chang’s story quite compelling. It’s an interesting, inside look at both the evolution of the semiconductor industry and the genesis of the ideas behind TSMC. Morris Chang (whose Chinese name is “Zhang Zhongmou”) was born in 1931 in Ningbo, China. His family seems middle class, or maybe upper middle class: Chang’s father works in finance for the local government, and then later for a bank in the city of Guangzhou. As a child Chang moves around a lot due to war: when the Sino-Japanese War breaks out in 1937, Guangzhou gets bombed, and Chang’s family moves to Hong Kong. When Japan attacks Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japan invades Hong Kong the same day, and after a year living in occupied Hong Kong Chang’s father takes the family across battle lines to Chongqing in Free China. A few years after the war ends, the family is forced to flee again back to Hong Kong as the Chinese Civil war worsens and Communist forces advance. By now, Chang is about to graduate high-school, and he’s not sure what he wants to do next. He hopes to be a writer, but his father convinces him that it’s hard to make a living as a writer, and suggests Chang pursue technology or engineering. At the time, Hong Kong has no good universities for science and technology, so Chang’s father encourages him to apply to college in the US. Chang’s uncle works as a professor for Northeastern University, and helps him apply to Harvard, where he’s accepted. In a freshman class of around 1100, Chang is the only Chinese student (Chang notes that in total there were only 14 minorities or foreign students in his class - 1 black, 1 japanese, 1 from Africa, 3 europeans, and 8 hispanic.) Chang thrives at Harvard, and at the end of his first year he's in the top 10% of his class. But while Chang ultimately hopes to go back to China in the future, his plans change when the Communists win the war, forcing the nationalists to flee to Taiwan. During his first year Chang was most interested in studying the humanities and literature, but now he thinks he needs to plan more for a future career. Chang still has no real interest in engineering, but (per his father) he thinks it will offer good career prospects, so he transfers to MIT to study mechanical engineering. He works hard, getting his bachelors in mechanical engineering in 1952, and a masters in 1953. Chang plans on continuing school to get a phD, as that’s what most Chinese students did at the time (apparently believing that it’s the only reliable way to have a stable career in the US.) Chang takes MIT’s phD entrance exam twice, and fails both times; MIT’s rules prevent him from taking it a third time. Dejected, and with his plans in shambles, Chang decides to look for work. He applies and gets offers from several places (he has a masters from MIT after all), and he narrows his options down to two: doing research at Ford Motor company, or helping to automate transistor manufacturing at a company called Sylvania. Ford seems like the obvious choice; it’s a huge, successful company that would offer Chang job security and the potential for career advancement, and Chang gets along great with his future supervisor. Sylvania seems chaotic, his future supervisor seems indifferent to him, and Chang has no idea what the heck a transistor is. He decides to take the Ford job. However, the Sylvania offer is $1 dollar a month higher than the Ford offer. Chang calls Ford and asks if they’ll match the offer. But the person he speaks to is rude and dismissive, refusing to negotiate at all, and Chang gets so angry that he decides to take the Sylvania offer instead. Chang starts work at Sylvania in 1955. At the time Sylvania is one of a handful of companies that have licensed AT&T’s technology and are manufacturing transistors. At Sylvania’s factory, transistors are manually assembled one transistor at a time (a good worker can make “dozens of transistors per hour”). Chang observes Sylvania’s manufacturing process; he doesn’t know much about transistors, but he knows that semiconductors are very sensitive to impurities and chemical changes, and suspects that workers are inadvertently damaging the transistors while welding them, greatly reducing yields. Chang develops a new welding method that doesn’t require so much heating of the transistor; yields improve, and soon every production line has adopted his new method. Chang throws himself into learning more about transistors and semiconductors. He begins studying William Shockley’s textbook about them, working through it one painstaking page at a time. He has a colleague who’s an expert on semiconductors, who spends every night drinking at a bar; Chang sits at the bar with him asking him questions about semiconductors, going home to study more, then going back to the bar if he has more questions. Chang’s automation project is quickly forgotten, and he gets promoted to head of the R&D department to help develop new transistor products. Over the next several years, his department develops several different transistors made from germanium (while today most transistors are silicon, germanium was the major transistor material until the 1960s.) Chang continues to study semiconductors, and begins to publish his own research papers about them in journals. But despite Chang’s efforts, Sylvania’s semiconductor division is doing poorly, due to (according to Chang) poor leadership. The division is led by sub-par people without any background in semiconductors, who can’t take advantage of all the technical talent they have. Chang realizes that Sylvania is falling behind, and when he’s forced to lay off some of his subordinates, Chang gets fed up. He quits and takes a job at Texas Instruments as an engineering supervisor, moving his family across the country from Boston to Dallas in 1958. When Chang arrives at Texas Instruments (TI), he’s immediately impressed. Almost everyone is young, less than 40, and everyone works very hard, 50 hours a week or more. Some employees work so much that they bring cots into the office to sleep. And while there’s an obvious chain of command, there’s few trappings of status or hierarchy: unlike at Sylvania, there are no special parking spaces for executives, executives and workers eat together in the cafeteria, and high-level managers and production-line workers converse freely. And while leadership at Sylvania had no real technical background in semiconductors, everyone at TI seems to be an expert on them. Chang’s first task at TI is to help resolve manufacturing issues with a transistor being made for IBM. IBM itself has a very hard time making this transistor, achieving around 5% yield (the fraction of transistors that are acceptable) on average. But when the process gets transferred to TI it doesn’t seem to work at all: engineers joke that the yields are “zero and stable”. Chang works obsessively to try to solve the problem, working from 8 in the morning until midnight day after day. He concludes that IBM’s process specs are no good, and makes changes to the process based on his knowledge of semiconductor theory and his production line experience at Sylvania. Gradually, yields start to climb, first hitting IBM’s performance and then surpassing it. Eventually yields are greater than 30%, a very high percentage at the time (today, 30% yields would be considered very low). Of the four transistors TI is making for IBM, only Chang’s line is exceeding IBM’s own yield rates. Chang soon gets promoted to R&D manager for germanium transistors. Over the next two years, Chang’s department grows to more than a dozen engineers. During this period Chang meets Jack Kilby, and learns of his plan to try to make an integrated circuit. Chang is skeptical—it's so hard to make even one transistor that surely manufacturing a device with many integrated ones will never be practical—but he nevertheless offers his expertise when Kilby asks him for advice. Eventually Chang is approached by a manager who tells him that he could eventually rise to the position of Vice President of R&D, but to do so he would need to get a phD, and that TI will pay for Chang to get one. Chang feels like he has no choice but to accept, even though he’s somewhat worried that he’ll be giving up opportunities by putting his career on pause while he’s in school. In 1961, Chang applies and is accepted into Stanford’s electrical engineering graduate program. He again works hard and graduates in 3 years, but when he returns to TI he finds that many of his former colleagues have advanced several rungs up the ladder, while he’s back in his old position. But Chang hopes that his new knowledge, and the fact that the people he worked with previously are now high in the company, bodes well for his future. Upon his return in 1964, Chang quickly gets assigned to help fix another germanium transistor manufacturing issue for IBM. He resolves it, and gets promoted to manager of the entire germanium transistor group. By now silicon transistors are starting to displace germanium ones, but the germanium department is still TI’s largest and most profitable division. As manager of an entire department, Chang has much more to worry about than the technical aspects of transistor manufacturing, and he resolves to learn all other aspects of the business—marketing, pricing, finance, strategy, accounting, and so on. Chang continues to excel and get promoted, first to head of the silicon transistor department in 1965, and then to the head of the integrated circuit department in 1966. When he arrives as head of TI’s integrated circuit department, the division is struggling. While demand is growing rapidly, there are numerous competitors which have driven down prices and profit margins. Chang devises several strategies to try to combat this. First, he takes advantage of TI’s advanced manufacturing capabilities to produce integrated circuits with more transistors on them (so-called “Medium Scale Integration”, or MSI). While TI’s current integrated circuits are standardized commodities that almost anyone can produce, few manufacturers can achieve MSI; if customers can be convinced of the value of MSI, the profits for TI will be much higher. Chang also works to raise integrated circuit yields, which at the time were less than 20%. He decides to start a new fab in Houston, very near the existing fab in Dallas. The new fab soon achieves yields of 40%, and in response to the competitive pressure the Dallas fab manages to raise their yields as well. While leading the integrated circuit division, Chang is introduced to learning curve theory by the Boston Consulting Group. The learning curve is the observation that production costs tend to fall by a constant percent every doubling of production volume. Chang quickly recognizes the power of this for semiconductor manufacturing: high market share and large production volumes will drive costs very low, creating a moat of efficiency that will be hard for competitors to overcome. With TI’s high yields, the company’s manufacturing costs are already lower than its competitors, so Chang decides to regularly reduce the price of integrated circuits to put the screws to the competition and try to capture market share. During this period, TI also starts setting up overseas factories, which leads to two other important developments for Chang. One is that Chang begins to visit Taiwan regularly after TI sets up a factory there. The other is that Chang observes that Asian semiconductor factories are able to achieve much better yields than American factories. In 1972, Chang gets promoted again, to head of the entire semiconductor division. But at this point he begins to struggle, and his relationship with his boss and TI’s leadership becomes strained. He fails with a project to develop 16 kilobyte RAM, and Chang’s bosses undermine him by setting up a parallel project, outside of Chang’s control, to copy a competitor’s 16k product. As head of a division in a rapidly growing industry one of Chang’s main tasks is hiring, but because TI is located in Texas, far from Silicon Valley, he has an increasingly difficult time attracting talent. This is made worse by the fact that Chang’s boss decides to build a new fab in Lubbock, Texas, essentially in the middle of nowhere. Chang refuses an order from his boss to preferentially allocate semiconductor production capacity to Texas Instrument products, instead opting to divide it fairly between internal and external customers. As tensions grow, TI’s leadership begins to publicly criticize Chang. Chang is also increasingly unhappy with the state of technical knowledge and decision making at TI. His immediate boss, Fred Bucy, has no semiconductor background, and the knowledge of the executive leadership is increasingly out of date (something they seem to be ignorant of). Chang tries to convince leadership to start buying manufacturing equipment from outside vendors, which is more advanced and can achieve higher yields than TI’s internally-designed equipment, but he’s unsuccessful. He also fails to convince them to increase R&D spending, which Chang views as a short-sighted decision to prioritize short-term profits over long-term competitiveness. Increasingly unhappy, in 1977 Chang asks for a transfer, and gets moved to head of TI’s consumer products division. But things don’t get better. Consumer products is a relatively recent initiative at TI to sell semiconductor-based products directly, rather than simply being a supplier to other companies, but the company soon finds that selling to consumers is a much different business than selling to businesses. When Chang takes over, TI has three product lines: simple consumer calculators, more advanced scientific calculators, and electronic watches. Only the scientific calculators are profitable, but they’re a very small source of revenue; the entire division is losing money. Chang isn’t able to do much to change this; he thinks the entire foray into consumer products is misguided. The only successful consumer product released during Chang’s leadership is the Speak and Spell in 1978: because it requires special speech synthesis chips that are difficult to design and fabricate, it can’t be easily copied by low-cost competitors like most of TI’s other products. But the profits from the Speak and Spell are relatively modest, and the overall trajectory of the division doesn’t change. In 1979, TI releases a personal computer for the home, the TI-99/4. Chang thinks this is a mistake, and he’s proved right: the TI-99/4 sells poorly, fewer than 20,000 units, and is described as “an embarrassing failure” (though its successor, the TI-99/4A, is much more successful). As head of the consumer products group, Chang is blamed for this failure, and in 1981 is moved to a new position, Director of Quality and Productivity, what Chang later describes as “being put out to pasture.” His bonus and level of seniority are reduced, and he thinks it’s only a matter of time before his stock options are taken away and he’s asked to retire. Though Chang has great loyalty to TI, he’s finally fed up, and he quits in 1983. Chang looks around for a new job, at one point considering a position as head of Kodak’s new digital photography department, but ultimately takes a job as president of General Instrument, an electronics manufacturer. He moves to New York City, into the 53rd floor of Trump Tower (Trump himself is his next door neighbor). But Chang isn’t any more successful at General Instrument than he was in his final years at Texas Instruments. His subordinates are indifferent or hostile to him, and he soon finds that his vision of his new role doesn’t line up with the CEO who hired him. Chang thinks he’s supposed to help build up General Instrument’s most successful existing businesses, but he gradually realizes that his boss wants him to acquire small companies, reorganize their operations, and then turn around and sell them, similar to a private equity firm. Within a year, Chang is asked to resign. During his short stint at General Instrument, Chang does have one notable experience. At one point he’s approached by an entrepreneur trying to raise $50 million to start a chip design company, but shortly afterwards the entrepreneur comes back and tells him that he doesn’t need the investment after all: instead of spending the money building a fab, he can simply outsource all his manufacturing to other semiconductor companies. (The entrepreneur is Gordon Campbell, who would go on to found Chips and Technologies, one of the first fabless semiconductor companies.) While Chang was struggling at Texas Instruments, on the other side of the world Taiwan was making plans to develop its high-tech industries, and become more than a source of “plastic toys and low-cost running shoes”. In 1973 Taiwan founded the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to help develop its industrial and technological capabilities. Taiwan’s industrial policy playbook was largely based on what had worked in Japan and Korea, and ITRI was based on similar institutes that had been founded in those two countries. One of the technology-based industries ITRI aimed to develop was semiconductor manufacturing, and in 1976 Taiwan licensed an obsolete 7-micron semiconductor manufacturing process from RCA, who was exiting the business. Before long ITRI had built a full-scale semiconductor production line using the new technology. Realizing that they would need outside expertise if they wanted the new semiconductor industry to succeed, Taiwanese leadership had been gently courting Morris Chang since the 1970s. During his time at TI Chang was invited to visit ITRI, and he authored a report on how Taiwan could develop its electronics industry. When ITRI was looking for technology to license, they asked Chang if TI was interested; though Chang declined (TI didn’t license any of its technology at the time), he helped them with their acquisition process, and confirmed that RCA’s CMOS-based technology was a good buy. And Chang was actually asked to become head of ITRI in 1982, before he even left TI, but he was unable to come to a workable arrangement with his boss and declined. After Chang leaves General Instrument, he’s once again asked to become head of ITRI, and this time he agrees. The purpose of ITRI is to help develop Taiwan’s technical industries, but when Chang arrives he finds it far too focused on academic-style research, and much too disconnected from the needs of industry. He comes up with a three-point plan to change this. First, ITRI should change its funding model so that half of its funding comes from industry. This will ensure that ITRI is researching things that are actually useful for private industry, and not just what’s interesting to the researchers. Second, to help diffuse the technology it develops, ITRI should start to spin off companies, staffed by ITRI employees. And third, the worst-performing ITRI employees should be put on probation; at the time no ITRI employee had ever been fired, and there was no mechanism in place to even give a warning. Chang hopes this will improve employee motivation and performance. Chang’s reform program is almost a complete failure. His idea to get industry funding is rejected, and he’s only able to maintain his employee probation program for one year. He’s able to spin off several companies, but none of them seem like immediate, obvious successes. Chang once again finds himself at odds with an organization he’s tasked with leading. His colleagues dislike him because of various failures of etiquette (such as asking questions during presentations, something considered normal in America but rude in Taiwan), and ITRI employees are angry at the threats to their job security the company spinoffs and probation policies represent. Eventually, Chang’s supporters in Taiwan’s government move on or retire; overwhelmed by opposition, Chang decides to leave ITRI in 1988. During his tenure at ITRI, Chang notes that he only managed to accomplish one big thing, something which occupies almost half his time while he’s there: founding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. On his second day at ITRI, Chang gets his predecessor’s to-do list. The first thing on the list is to deal with requests from three different integrated circuit companies to build semiconductor fabs. The requests have put ITRI in a bind: funding the construction of three separate fabs will cost more than $100 million, an enormous amount of money for ITRI to spend. On the other hand, ITRI’s whole reason for existence is to help develop industrial technology, and ITRI has spent years trying to develop its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. How can they now turn around and reject requests that will help expand it? Leadership feels stuck, but Chang sees a way forward. At the time, most semiconductor manufacturers both designed chips and manufactured them. A company might rent out its extra fab capacity if it happens to have some, but it's hard for other companies to rely on this. Using another company’s fabrication capacity typically requires very close relationships with it; it's not the sort of thing that someone can just walk in off the street and buy. And when using another company’s capacity, someone who might be a competitor, there’s always the risk that they’ll appropriate your chip designs, or prioritize their own production over yours. Indeed, Texas Instruments had been sued by companies arguing that TI had unfairly prioritized manufacturing chips for its own internal use; TI had only prevailed in that lawsuit because Chang disobeyed his boss and refused to do this. So Chang knows that it’s hard to simply “buy” someone’s else's fab capacity. But he also knows that it’s getting harder and harder to build your own fabs; the cost of them keeps going up and up. Because of his knowledge of the learning curve, Chang also knows that it's very important for fabs to have as large an output as possible to achieve low production costs, and that current Taiwanese fabs are much too small. Chang has already seen entrepreneurs trying to start semiconductor companies that won’t have fabs at all, and will simply rent the capacity they need. And he remembers the very high profit margins Texas Instruments achieved when it manufactured custom-designed products for other customers rather than standardized ones. He’s also seen what can be achieved by a fab using vendor-supplied manufacturing equipment; building a fab no longer means having to build all the manufacturing equipment yourself. ITRI doesn’t have much in the way of semiconductor manufacturing capability. Thanks to licensing RCA’s technology, it’s built a real integrated circuit manufacturing line, but the technology was outdated when it was licensed, and while ITRI has pushed it forward (going from 7 microns to 5 microns to 4.5 microns), the rest of the industry has advanced faster, and ITRI only fallen further behind the cutting edge. It has no ability to design or market its own chips. ITRI’s only real advantage is that it has managed to achieve very high process yields, something Chang has repeatedly seen with southeast asian semiconductor fabs. Based on all these factors, Chang proposes that instead of building a separate fab for each firm requesting one, ITRI should build a single “common fab” to be used by all three. This operation will be a corporate spin-off from ITRI, staffed by existing ITRI personnel. And it won’t just make chips for these three companies: the new company will offer “foundry” semiconductor fabrication services; anyone who wants to have a chip built by them can. It won’t do any design work, or compete with any of its customers in any way. All the chips it makes will be designed by others. Chang hopes that this new business can eventually operate at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology, but as conceived its essentially a customer service play: its “product” will be reliable contract semiconductor fabrication services that right now don’t exist. Customers can get their chips fabricated without needing to develop special relationships, or worrying that they might get booted to the back of the line. It won’t offer cutting-edge technology, but not all chips need the latest and greatest process node. Chang thinks that with the rising cost of building a semiconductor fab, such services will only get more attractive, and that reliable contract manufacturing will allow for the creation of many more “fabless” companies that don’t have their own fabs at all. Chang’s plan faces opposition, but he eventually convinces Taiwan’s leadership that funding this new venture, to be called Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is worthwhile. However, there’s no way to fund such a venture without private investors contributing, and private investors won’t contribute if the project looks too risky. To create confidence in the project, Chang needs to find an existing semiconductor manufacturer to partner with, who will contribute a significant portion of the funding. Chang asks all the major semiconductor manufacturers, including Intel, Texas Instruments, Motorola, AMD, Panasonic, and Sony if they want to invest. Though everyone knows and respects Chang, they all turn him down. The only company that’s interested is Phillips, a second-rate semiconductor manufacturer from the Netherlands. Phillips agrees not because the idea of TSMC seems especially compelling, but because they want to take advantage of Taiwan’s low-cost labor and expand their factory operations there, and investing in TSMC seems like a good way to win favor with Taiwan’s government. Ultimately Phillips invests $40 million in the new venture, private investors contribute $35 million, and the government invests $70 million.1 To run the company, Chang needs someone with close connections to the European and American semiconductor industries. While TSMC’s early customers will be Taiwanese, Chang knows that long term it will only be successful if it can sell to the larger American and European markets. Chang thinks he himself is best suited for this, but because he’s running ITRI Chang instead hires Jim Dykes, the former director of GE’s semiconductor business, which GE is closing down. Dykes joins in early 1987, shortly after TSMC’s first factory (a repurposed production line in an ITRI building) comes online. As expected, TSMC’s first customers are Taiwanese semiconductor companies, but in late 1987 the company gets an unexpected visit from Intel. Intel wants to use TSMC to produce some of Intel’s older, less advanced products so it can free up capacity to produce more leading edge chips. Intel first gives TSMC a trial run to see if TSMC’s yields will meet Intel’s requirements; when they do, Intel becomes TSMC’s first American customer, but not before requiring TSMC to establish a rigorous production control system, including quality control, preventative maintenance, and statistical process control. Landing Intel as a customer sends a strong signal of TSMC’s competence, and Intel is soon followed by many other major semiconductor manufacturers wanting to outsource portions of their production: Motorola, Texas Instruments, Phillips, and so on. In some cases, not only are TSMC’s costs lower than the company doing the outsourcing, but its yields are higher. By 1988, TSMC is cash-flow positive, and (after Chang successfully navigates board opposition) the company breaks ground on its second factory. This factory is what really begins to drive TSMC’s success: while the first factory was a repurposed ITRI building, the second factory is a new, greenfield development. Not only will it operate at a much larger scale (30,000 wafers a month vs 13,000 in the first factory), lowering per-unit production costs, but it marks the beginning of TSMC’s efforts to push its manufacturing technology forward. The new factory is the first semiconductor factory in the world to adopt the SMIF (Standard Mechanical Interface) wafer-carrying pod The predecessor to today’s FOUPs, SMIFs act as micro-cleanrooms for wafers, reducing their exposure to environmental contaminants and decreasing defects. TSMC also takes a risk with its lithography machines, the beating heart of a semiconductor fab; while most semiconductor manufacturers use machines from Nikon or Canon, TSMC opts for higher-performing, but relatively untested machines from a new company called ASML (in part this is because ASML was spun off from Philips, TSMC’s major investor.) (At some point during these events, Chang takes over as head of TSMC, but the book is weirdly silent on the specifics of that transition. Chang talks about Dykes’ successors but not what happens after he himself leaves ITRI.) TSMC’s bets pay off, and the company grows rapidly; over a period of 10 years its revenues grow at an average rate of 49% annually, and by 1995 it has surpassed $1 billion in revenue. By 2000, TSMC is operating five factories, and producing more than 3 million wafers a year. And while much of its production is for other large semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Chang’s prediction about the rise of “fabless” semiconductor manufacturers is born out. By 2000 60% of TSMC’s revenues are from fabless companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Nvidia. The first volume of the autobiography covers from Chang’s birth in 1931 to around 1964. The periods described above, covering most of Chang’s career at Texas Instruments and his tenure at TSMC up to around 2000, make up around half of volume two. Unfortunately, I found the remainder of volume two surprisingly uninteresting. It consists mostly of discussion of high-level corporate operations: mergers, joint ventures, ownership agreements (there’s a lot on Chang dealing with Philips’ option to buy out TSMC), Chang’s thoughts on boards of directors and investment bankers, and so on. Conversely, there’s very little on what I was most interested in: the nuts and bolts on how TSMC continued to push manufacturing technology forward, adopting EUV, and so on. There’s a few interesting bits (such as how the deal for TSMC to make chips for the iPhone came about, or Chang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang resolving a business dispute over a pizza dinner), but they’re the exception. What strikes me most about reading Chang’s story is that, despite his immense talent, how often he ends up failing (or at least ends up in situations where he can’t succeed). Much has been made about how foolish Texas Instruments was to pass over Chang, and how if they hadn’t maybe TSMC could have been founded in America, but the reality is more complex and more interesting. Chang not only gets passed over for leadership at Texas Instruments (due to his perceived failures in the consumer products group and his ongoing tensions with executive leadership), but he fails at his next two jobs as well. He’s asked to leave by the CEO of General Instruments, and he’s effectively forced to resign as the head of ITRI after mostly failing to reform it and angering everyone in the process. After he leaves ITRI (his third resignation in five years) Chang wonders if, per the Peter principle, he’s risen to the level of his incompetence. And it seems like his one big accomplishment at ITRI, founding TSMC, wasn’t exactly a sure thing. Almost no existing semiconductor companies thought Chang’s plan was worth funding; the one that does, Philips, is more interested in currying favor with the Taiwanese government than it is with the merits of the business. It’s very easy to imagine TSMC not getting off the ground at all if things go slightly differently. Chang’s immense success with TSMC looks obvious only in hindsight; nobody at the time, including the Taiwanese government, other semiconductor manufacturers, and Chang himself, saw it that way. Footnote: TSMC also gets another $57 million in the form of a loan, from (presumably) the government. Probably already known but I believe that Emergent Ventures recently awarded a grant to translate Chang’s autobiography. Amazing story. This man fails at least three times and bounces back.

US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the sour final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. The major indexes posted big wins in 2024, a year that was marked by a continued surge in the artificial intelligence trade — led by the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — even as the bull rally broadened across the board. The single biggest winner in the S&P was Palantir (PLTR), with a nearly 350% gain for the year, while the biggest loser was Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) which gave up 64% of its value. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve made its first interest rate cut in four years, and President-elect Donald Trump's impending return to the White House drove stocks higher in the last two months. (Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal have a great rundown of the year's big themes in charts.) In commodities, gold (GC=F) increased 28% this year, logging its biggest yearly gain since 2010. And in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 100% this year, though it has pulled back from the $100,000 level it breached earlier this month. But overall, the good times have stalled in the last week, as markets have given up some of their big gains — all the more uncharacteristic considering the typical "Santa Claus" rally that marks the end of the year. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the weak final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI) started 2024 reaping the rewards of an artificial intelligence darling. But the year turned out to be a bust. Shares of the AI server maker were on track to notch a yearly gain of just 6% on Tuesday afternoon — far less than other AI-themed stocks that have thrived in the bull market in 2024. And despite turning positive for the year in December, Super Micro shares remained far below their highs near $120 in mid-March. Shares began to see signs of volatility early this year as the company struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations. The stock's performance became increasingly unstable in the latter half of 2024 as Super Micro grappled with the fallout from a report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, accusing the server maker of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Read the full story here on Super Micro's wild ride this year. The Federal Reserve's stance that interest rates will remain "higher for longer" will extend into 2025, even as the central bank has cut rates three times this year, amounting to a reduction of 100 basis points. Fed Chair Powell has sad he expects inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — that change played into officials scaling back the number of expected rate cuts to make next year from four to two. Inflation is proving to be stubborn, And with the potential for Trump to reignite pricing pressures through new economic policies, the Fed is poised to take a cautious approach with any future rate hikes. Market bets on the Fed's first policy decision of the new year predict rates to stay the same, with a roughly 90% chance, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The potential for the first cut won't come until March, according to the data. Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence, reports Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. Read more about retail investor interest in 2024 here. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is stoking new speculation that the Trump administration could end one of the oldest fights on Wall Street by loosening the federal government’s grip over Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Ackman said Monday on X that "there is a credible path" for the mortgage giants to be removed from government conservatorship and made into private companies within the next two years. That could result in an initial public offering in 2026. "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history," added Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management. "I am confident he will get it done." The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — jumped in the hours after Ackman’s comments. They are now up 168% and 138%, respectively, since Donald Trump’s election win. Read more about Ackmann's theory about privatizing the mortgage giants here. The last trading day of the year is set to be a disappointment as all three major indexes slipped into the red, punctuating a year of heady gains. US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4% during afternoon trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Despite the lackluster trading day the benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% gain. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks, consisting of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), put up a blockbuster year. The major players averaged stock gains of more than 60%, far outpacing the broader market's roughly 24% yearly return. Nvidia took the top spot, rallying more than 170% and fully capitalizing on the AI mania that struck the market this year. Tesla, at a 67% gain in share price, is riding high on the Trump bump, as CEO Elon Musk has become a close adviser to the incoming president. Meta is close behind, registering a gain of 66%, punctuating a remarkable comeback story. Amazon and Alphabet are set to notch 45% and 36% gains, respectively, as both platforms leverage their cloud computing businesses to generate new revenue from AI. Apple registered a 30% increase, as bullish analysts see a "golden era" for the iPhone maker. And Microsoft rounded out the group, rising 12%. While the end of the year fizzle may have put a damper on Wall Street, if you zoom out just a little, the year showered investors with huge gains. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to post a 24% gain, matching the return from 2023. These back-to-back annual gains mark the best performance for the index since 1997 and 1998. That's the best consecutive set of yearly increases since the run-up to the dot-com bubble. And while analysts don't expect the benchmark index to log another year above 20% — as interest rates may remain elevated and corporate earnings face higher and higher expectations — 2025 is poised to be another robust year for investors. S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 15% year over year in 2025, according to FactSet data, fueling another bullish outlook for the year ahead. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have clashed before, and there is a chance they will do so again in 2025. Their collision could unfold in multiple ways, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is "absurdly overstaffed" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how Trump's proposed tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions.

(Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal have a great rundown of the year's big themes in charts.) In commodities, gold (GC=F) increased 28% this year, logging its biggest yearly gain since 2010. And in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 100% this year, though it has pulled back from the $100,000 level it breached earlier this month. But overall, the good times have stalled in the last week, as markets have given up some of their big gains — all the more uncharacteristic considering the typical "Santa Claus" rally that marks the end of the year. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the weak final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI) started 2024 reaping the rewards of an artificial intelligence darling. But the year turned out to be a bust. Shares of the AI server maker were on track to notch a yearly gain of just 6% on Tuesday afternoon — far less than other AI-themed stocks that have thrived in the bull market in 2024. And despite turning positive for the year in December, Super Micro shares remained far below their highs near $120 in mid-March. Shares began to see signs of volatility early this year as the company struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations. The stock's performance became increasingly unstable in the latter half of 2024 as Super Micro grappled with the fallout from a report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, accusing the server maker of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Read the full story here on Super Micro's wild ride this year. The Federal Reserve's stance that interest rates will remain "higher for longer" will extend into 2025, even as the central bank has cut rates three times this year, amounting to a reduction of 100 basis points. Fed Chair Powell has sad he expects inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — that change played into officials scaling back the number of expected rate cuts to make next year from four to two. Inflation is proving to be stubborn, And with the potential for Trump to reignite pricing pressures through new economic policies, the Fed is poised to take a cautious approach with any future rate hikes. Market bets on the Fed's first policy decision of the new year predict rates to stay the same, with a roughly 90% chance, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The potential for the first cut won't come until March, according to the data. Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence, reports Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. Read more about retail investor interest in 2024 here. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is stoking new speculation that the Trump administration could end one of the oldest fights on Wall Street by loosening the federal government’s grip over Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Ackman said Monday on X that "there is a credible path" for the mortgage giants to be removed from government conservatorship and made into private companies within the next two years. That could result in an initial public offering in 2026. "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history," added Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management. "I am confident he will get it done." The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — jumped in the hours after Ackman’s comments. They are now up 168% and 138%, respectively, since Donald Trump’s election win. Read more about Ackmann's theory about privatizing the mortgage giants here. The last trading day of the year is set to be a disappointment as all three major indexes slipped into the red, punctuating a year of heady gains. US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4% during afternoon trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Despite the lackluster trading day the benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% gain. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks, consisting of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), put up a blockbuster year. The major players averaged stock gains of more than 60%, far outpacing the broader market's roughly 24% yearly return. Nvidia took the top spot, rallying more than 170% and fully capitalizing on the AI mania that struck the market this year. Tesla, at a 67% gain in share price, is riding high on the Trump bump, as CEO Elon Musk has become a close adviser to the incoming president. Meta is close behind, registering a gain of 66%, punctuating a remarkable comeback story. Amazon and Alphabet are set to notch 45% and 36% gains, respectively, as both platforms leverage their cloud computing businesses to generate new revenue from AI. Apple registered a 30% increase, as bullish analysts see a "golden era" for the iPhone maker. And Microsoft rounded out the group, rising 12%. While the end of the year fizzle may have put a damper on Wall Street, if you zoom out just a little, the year showered investors with huge gains. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to post a 24% gain, matching the return from 2023. These back-to-back annual gains mark the best performance for the index since 1997 and 1998. That's the best consecutive set of yearly increases since the run-up to the dot-com bubble. And while analysts don't expect the benchmark index to log another year above 20% — as interest rates may remain elevated and corporate earnings face higher and higher expectations — 2025 is poised to be another robust year for investors. S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 15% year over year in 2025, according to FactSet data, fueling another bullish outlook for the year ahead. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have clashed before, and there is a chance they will do so again in 2025. Their collision could unfold in multiple ways, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is "absurdly overstaffed" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how Trump's proposed tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions.

Title: Apple stock named among 10 ‘Tech Winners For The AI Revolution’

Update font size. Reset Following a late-2024 pullback, AI stocks, including Apple, are set to resume climbing in 2025, a Wall Street analyst says. “We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI capex (spending) over the next 3 years,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note late Monday. Patrick Seitz for Investor’s Business Daily: ‎ Ives said he expects tech stocks to rise 25% in 2025 as Wall Street and investors digest “a less regulatory spiderweb” under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Also, stronger artificial intelligence initiatives in the federal government should give the sector a boost, he said. Ives identified 10 stocks that he called “tech winners for the AI revolution in 2025.” AI chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) leads the list, followed by cloud computing giant and OpenAI partner Microsoft (MSFT). Rounding out the list are Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), MongoDB (MDB), Pegasystems (PEGA), Snowflake (SNOW), and Salesforce (CRM). ‎ MacDailyNews Take: 2025 will be the year when Apple Intelligence becomes fully formed!

Intel, the 56-year-old chipmaker co-founded by industry pioneers Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce and legendary investor Arthur Rock, had its worst year since going public in 1971, losing 61% of its value. The opposite story unfolded at Broadcom, the chip conglomerate run by CEO Hock Tan and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, about 15 miles from Intel's Santa Clara campus. Broadcom's stock price soared 111% in 2024 as of Monday's close, its best performance ever. The current company is the product of a 2015 acquisition by Avago, which went public in 2009. The driving force behind the diverging narratives was artificial intelligence. Broadcom rode the AI train, while Intel largely missed it. The changing fortunes of the two chipmakers underscores the fleeting nature of leadership in the tech industry and how a few key decisions can result in hundreds of billions — or even trillions — of dollars in market cap shifts. Broadcom develops custom chips for Google and other huge cloud companies. It also makes essential networking gear that large server clusters need to tie thousands of AI chips together. Within AI, Broadcom has largely been overshadowed by Nvidia, whose graphics processing units, or GPUs, power most of the large language models being developed at OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and Amazon and also enable the heftiest AI workloads. Despite having a lower profile, Broadcom's accelerator chips, which the company calls XPUs, have become a key piece of the AI ecosystem. "Why it's really shooting up is because they're talking about AI, AI, AI, AI," Eric Ross, chief investment strategist at Cascend, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month. Intel, which for decades was the dominant U.S. chipmaker, has been mostly shut out of AI. Its server chips lag far behind Nvidia's, and the company has also lost market share to longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices while spending heavily on new factories. Intel's board ousted Pat Gelsinger from the CEO role on Dec. 1, after a tumultuous four-year tenure. "I think someone more innovative might have seen the AI wave coming," Paul Argenti, professor of management at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said in an interview on "Squawk Box" after the announcement. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment. Broadcom is now worth about $1.1 trillion and is the eighth U.S. tech company to cross the trillion-dollar mark. It's the second most valuable chip company, behind Nvidia, which has driven the AI boom to a $3.4 trillion valuation, trailing only Apple among all public companies. Nvidia's stock price soared 178% this year, but actually did better in 2023, when it gained 239%. Until four years ago, Intel was the world's most valuable chipmaker, nearing a $300 billion market cap in early 2020. The company is now worth about $85 billion, just got booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average — replaced by Nvidia — and has been in talks to sell off core parts of its business. Intel now ranks 15th in market cap among semiconductor companies globally. Following the Avago-Broadcom merger in 2015, the combined company's biggest business was chips for TV set-top boxes and broadband routers. Broadcom still makes Wi-Fi chips used in laptops as well as the iPhone and other smartphones. After a failed bid to buy mobile chip giant Qualcomm in 2018, Broadcom turned its attention to software companies. The capstone of its spending spree came in 2022 with the announced acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware for $61 billion. Software accounted for 41% of Broadcom's $14 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, thanks in part to VMware. What's exciting Wall Street is Broadcom's role working with cloud providers to build custom chips for AI. The company's XPUs are generally simpler and less expensive to operate than Nvidia's GPUs, and they're designed to run specific AI programs efficiently. Cloud vendors and other large internet companies are spending billions of dollars a year on Nvidia's GPUs so they can build their own models and run AI workloads for customers. Broadcom's success with custom chips is setting up an AI spending showdown with Nvidia, as hyperscale cloud companies look to differentiate their products and services from their rivals. Broadcom's chips aren't for everyone, as only a handful of companies can afford to design and build their own custom processors. "You have to be a Google, you have to be a Meta, you have to be a Microsoft or an Oracle to be able to use those chips," Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Dec. 13, a day after Broadcom's earnings. "These chips are not meant for everybody." While 2024 has been a breakout year for Broadcom — AI revenue increased 220% — the month of December has put it in record territory. The stock is up 45% for the month as of Monday's close, 16 percentage points better than its prior best month. On the company's earnings call on Dec. 12, Tan told investors that Broadcom had doubled shipments of its XPUs to its three hyperscale providers. The most well known of the bunch is Google, which counts on the technology for its Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, used to train Apple's AI software released this year. The other two customers, according to analysts, are TikTok parent ByteDance and Meta. Tan said that within about two years, companies could spend between $60 billion and $90 billion on XPUs. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric," Tan said of the three hyperscale customers. In addition to AI chips, AI server clusters need powerful networking parts to train the most advanced models. Networking chips for AI accounted for 76% of Broadcom's $4.5 billion of networking sales in the fourth quarter. Broadcom said that, in total, about 40% of its $30.1 billion in 2024 semiconductor sales were related to AI, and that AI revenue would increase 65% in the first quarter to $3.8 billion. "The degree of success amongst the hyperscalers in their initiatives here is clearly an area up for debate," Cantor analyst C.J. Muse, who recommends buying Broadcom shares, wrote in a report on Dec. 18. "But any way you slice it, the focus here will continue to be a meaningful boon for those levered to custom silicon." Prior to 2024, Intel's worst year on the market was 1974, when the stock sank 57%. The seeds for the company's latest stumbles were planted years ago, as Intel missed out on mobile chips to Qualcomm, ARM and Apple. Rival AMD started taking market share in the critical PC and server CPU markets thanks to its productive manufacturing relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel's manufacturing process has been a notch behind for years, leading to slower and less power-efficient central processing units, or CPUs. But Intel's most costly whiff is in AI — and it's a big reason Gelsinger was removed. Nvidia's GPUs, originally created for video games, have become the critical hardware in the development of power-hungry AI models. Intel's CPU, formerly the most important and expensive part in a server, has become an afterthought in an AI server. The GPUs Nvidia will ship in 2025 don't even need an Intel CPU — many of them are paired to an Nvidia-designed ARM-based chip. As Nvidia has reported revenue growth of at least 94% for the past six quarters, Intel has been forced into downsizing mode. Sales have declined in nine of the past 11 periods. Intel announced in August that it was cutting 15,000 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce. "We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel," board Chair Frank Yeary said in a Dec. 2 press release announcing Gelsinger's departure. A big problem for Intel is that it lacks a comprehensive AI strategy. It's touted the AI capabilities on its laptop chips to investors, and released an Nvidia competitor called Gaudi 3. But neither the company's AI PC initiative nor its Gaudi chips have gained much traction in the market. Intel's Gaudi 3 sales missed the company's own $500 million target for this year. Late next year, Intel will release a new AI chip that it codenamed Falcon Shores. It won't be built on Gaudi 3 architecture, and will instead be a GPU. "Is it going to be wonderful? No, but it is a good first step in getting the platform done," Intel interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus said at a financial conference held by Barclays on Dec. 12. Holthaus and fellow interim co-CEO David Zinsner have vowed to focus on Intel's products, leaving the fate of Intel's costly foundry division unclear. Before he left, Gelsinger championed a strategy that involved Intel both finding its footing in the semiconductor market and manufacturing chips to compete with TSMC. In June, at a conference in Taipei, Gelsinger told CNBC that when its factories get up and running, Intel wanted to build "everybody's AI chips," and give companies such as Nvidia and Broadcom an alternative to TSMC. Intel said in September that it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital. But for now, Intel's primary client is Intel. The company said it didn't expect meaningful sales from external customers until 2027. At the Barclays event this month, Zinsner said the separate board for the foundry business is "getting stood up today." More broadly, he indicated that the company is looking to remove complexity and associated costs wherever possible. "We are going to constantly be scrutinizing where we're spending money, making sure that we're getting the appropriate return," Zinsner said.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR)It's been a tough month for MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer turned bitcoin (BTC) accumulator. Its stock has tumbled almost 50% since November, when it joined the Nasdaq 100 index and peaked at a 600% gain since the start of the year. That still leaves the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company a whopping 342% ahead in 2024, the biggest return among the highest-profile crypto-linked assets in traditional finance (TradFi). It's been a volatile year, packed with geopolitical and technological developments to rattle financial markets. The continuing wars in eastern Europe and the Middle East, elections across the globe, the unwinding of the yen carry trade in August and the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) have all left their marks. MicroStrategy's gain is almost double that of Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker whose production of integrated circuits needed for AI applications fueled a 185% return, the best among the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks. The next best, Meta Platforms (META), turned in 71%. Bitcoin itself rose 100% in a year that included April's reward halving and multiple record highs. Demand for the largest cryptocurrency was driven by the January approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. Bitcoin outperformed two of its biggest competitors, ether (ETH), up 42%, and Solana (SOL), up 79%. Among the ETF's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also returned over 100% and became the fastest ETF in history to hit $50 billion in assets. Bitcoin mining companies, on the whole, disappointed. Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), a proxy for mining stocks, rose just under 30%. That's despite demand for the miners' computing capabilities and power supply agreements from artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC) companies.

The precious commodity has now topped the equity gauge in three of the past five years. Concerns about U.S. inflation and the country's budget deficit added to the geopolitical uncertainties to prompt a massive rise in U.S. treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction to price. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury added 15% to 4.5% over the course of the year, and surprisingly gained a full 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks bond prices, dropped 10% this year and has lost 40% in the past five years. The dollar, on the other hand, showed its strength.

Title: Biggest Career Comebacks Of 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/12/31/biggest-career-comebacks-of-2024/
Time Published: 2024-12-31T11:30:00Z

A fall from the top doesn’t mean you can’t climb your way back up. Propelled by pro-Trump endorsements, multi-million dollar investments and cryptocurrency bets, our list illustrates some formerly-disgraced leaders bringing their careers, and businesses, back to the top. For over a decade Forbes has documented the most notable career crashes (see the 2024 list here), so we thought it appropriate to look at the business leaders who have bounced back in 2024, bringing their businesses and careers back from the brink. Yes, the mighty can fall, but they can also make their way back to the top. Former President Donald Trump left office in 2021 twice impeached and in debt. This time around, he's coming into office more popular, and richer, than ever. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) If there is one man who knows how to make a comeback, it’s Donald Trump. Despite having three outstanding criminal cases and awaiting sentencing after becoming a convicted felon, the 78-year-old will be sworn in as the United States' 47th President on January 20th after winning a closely-watched presidential race. Last time he was in office, Trump left the White House twice impeached, drowning in debt and with a disapproval rating of 62%, the highest of any President leaving office other than Richard Nixon. Now, a majority of Americans approve of his handling of the presidential transition. Today, on the heels of his decisive election victory, Trump is more popular than ever. He’s currently worth $6.2 billion, down from a peak of $8.1 billion in May. Businessman and close ally of Donald Trump, Elon Musk tops our careers comebacks list after two years of career crashes. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When Elon Musk landed on Forbes’ list of most notable career crashes in 2022, his new ownership of Twitter (now X) was all to blame. In his short tenure as CEO before Linda Yaccarino stepped in, he botched layoffs, mocked users, flipped on policies and worried investors across his business portfolio, most notably Tesla. Today, he’s the richest man in the world. In December he became the first person to surpass a $400 billion net worth, thanks to a new $350 billion valuation for SpaceX. It accounts for a more than $150 billion jump in wealth this year, thanks in part to his 13% stake in Tesla, whose stock is up 70% this year, and an estimated 54% stake in xAI, which investors reportedly valued at $50 billion in November. Beyond his wealth, Musk also holds the top spot in Trump’s new brain trust. After spending $200 million to get Trump elected, he was tapped to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, which will advise on ways to cut government spending, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. WeWork founder Adam Neumann launched and opened the first apartments of his new co-living startup, Flow this year after receiving over $300 million in funding. (Photo by Romain Maurice/Getty Images) The founder and former CEO of WeWork returned to the headlines this year in a series of splashy commitments to purchase the co-working company out of bankruptcy. Under Neumann’s leadership, WeWork went from a startup valued at $47 billion to a failed IPO before he stepped down as CEO. In February, Neumann announced he’d buy back the company for $650 million alongside Dan Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point, but the offer was ultimately rebuffed. Instead, he turned his sights into developing his latest real estate startup. In August, Neumann’s Flow quietly opened up its first property in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The startup, which is the billionaire’s latest attempt at building co-living and working spaces, raised $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz in 2022 to build “the future of living.” Its two other branded properties in Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida, opened in April. All of these new investments have contributed to Neumann’s continued billionaire status; his $2.3 billion net worth comes from a nearly 10% stake in WeWork, majority stakes in apartment buildings worth $1 billion before debt and the over $1 billion 2022 valuation of Flow. Michael Saylor's bet on bitcoin is paying off this year as the cryptocurrency surpassed $100,000 for the first time. (Photo by Jason Koerner/Getty Images for Bitcoin Magazine) Bitcoin maximalist and MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor had an epic 2024. The former rocket scientist has turned MicroStrategy into one of the biggest institutional holders of bitcoin, owning 439,000 coins now worth an approximate $44 billion. While some were skeptical of the software company’s extreme bitcoin holdings––the company now describes itself as “the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company”––it’s paying off. MicroStrategy’s stock is up 403% this year, outstripping bitcoin’s 137% gain and the S&P 500’s 24% return. Saylor has only cashed in on stock price surge, bolstered even further by its mid-December inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 stock index, the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund. All in all, Saylor’s net-worth has more than doubled in the last year, thanks to his personal bitcoin holdings and his stake in MicroStrategy. He’s currently worth $8.7 billion. Fran Horowitz became CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch when the company hit its lowest stock price in history. Today, it's one of the best-performing mid-cap stocks, and its products are loved from teens to millennials alike. (Photo by Dominik Bindl/Getty Images) The CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch is enjoying another year of growth for the millennial and GenZ-loved apparel company. Under the leadership of Fran Horowitz, who came in as CEO in 2017, the company’s stock has risen from an all-time low of under $10 per share to today’s $149. It’s helped it become one of the top mid-cap stocks in the United States this year, with a 500% growth since 2023 and 60% this year. Horowitz’s focus on inclusive sizing, a broadened product range and a new brand image targeting professionals has propelled twelve-month sales to $4.8 billion in December, up 20% from last year. New this year is a wedding dress business. Horowitz has propelled the company’s sales and financial success all while fighting off associations of its past. In October, the Department of Justice charged former CEO Mike Jeffried with sex trafficking and interstate prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty. Bernard Looney, former BP CEO, swapped oil for AI data centers. (Photo by Arun SANKAR / AFP) (Photo by ARUN SANKAR/AFP via Getty Images) Just one year after the former CEO of BP abruptly resigned from the job after failing to disclose past relationships with female colleagues at the company, Bernard Looney is joining the board of Prometheus Hyperscale, a Wyoming-based data company. In May, Prometheus Hyperscale signed a partnership agreement with Oko, a nuclear energy company backed by Open AI CEO Sam Altman. In his new position as chairman of the board, Looney will be leading the company’s effort to build its flagship $10 billion data center in Evanston. In the last month, he’s also joined the board of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). Prior to his resignation in September 2023, Looney had a long career at the british oil and gas giant, climbing the ranks from a post-graduate drilling engineer to chief executive for just three years. While BP said he technically didn’t breach company rules, he wasn’t “fully transparent” and did have to forfeit more than $40 million in compensation and some of his previous bonus for “knowingly mis[leading] the board” in an act of “serious misconduct.” John Galliano is leaving his position as creative director of Maison Margiela ten years after the french luxury house first hired him. (Photo by Jacopo Raule/Getty Images) Talk about leaving at the top. After leading Maison Margiela as creative director for the last ten years and stunning the fashion world with January’s Maison Margiela Artisanal show, John Galliano is set to depart the French luxury fashion house. He’s responsible for the brand’s infamous Tabi shoes and a 23% growth in sales in 2023, according to Vogue Business. As for what’s next after Maison Margiela, he’s tight-lipped. “When the time is right, all will be revealed,” he wrote on an Instagram post. It’s a sharp contrast to how the British designer first started working with the brand. The Maison Margiela job was his first after a scandalous exit from Dior in 2011, where he’d been creative director since 1996. Galliano was largely credited for turning Christian Dior into a multimillion-dollar brand, but was fired during Paris Fashion Week after videos surfaced of him making antisemitic remarks. His comeback from fashion world exile to fashion and internet fame was so grand it’s been charted on the Amazon Prime documentary High and Low: John Galliano, released in March. It turns out it is possible to have a career crash and a comeback all in one year. In May, Sankaet Pathank, founder and CEO of the fintech Synapse was ousted from the company as a bankruptcy judge removed existing management and appointed an independent Chapter 11 trustee to oversee the company. The struggling banking-as-a-service company finally filed for bankruptcy this year after a year of searching for banking partners and potential buyers. In its wake it’s frozen tens of thousands of customers out of $114 million of their own funds, but lawyers say up to 20 million end-users are at risk. As the court goes on with bankruptcy proceedings, Pathak is already looking at, and funding, his new venture. In August he told TechCrunch he’d raised $11 million from Tribe Capital, among others, for his new company, Foundation, a robotics startup that aims to create humanoid robots to address the labor shortage.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US markets wrapped up a blockbuster 2024 by marking an achievement so rare that it’s only ever happened a handful of times. Despite US stocks closing lower Tuesday in a disappointing December that saw the Dow drop over 2,000 points, or about 5%, and the S&P 500 slide 2.5%, this was a stellar year for stocks. The S&P 500 gained more than 23% this year after rising 24% in 2023. The back-to-back gains of over 20% is the best performance for the benchmark index since 1997 and 1998, according to data from FactSet. It’s an extraordinary event for the modern-day version of the index. (Precursors also racked up that kind of performance three other times, in 1927 and 1928, 1935 and 1936 and in 1954 and 1955, according to a Bank of America analysis.) That means your retirement savings might be looking a little more cushioned than usual. Retirement plans in the form of a 401(k) or other pension fund are often invested in indices like the S&P 500. So, when stocks have a standout year, your account balance will benefit. Despite fizzling out in December and missing an expected “Santa Claus rally” to close out 2024, markets notched a blockbuster year, building off a strong 2023. Wall Street saw impressive returns this year as inflation cooled and consumer spending remained strong, while the job market proved solid but slowing. Investors were bullish on strong earnings growth for tech companies, and stocks surged following President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection in November. The blue-chip Dow index rose 12.9% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 28.6%. The S&P 500 is up by around 53% over the past two years, after a poor performance in 2022 that saw the index fall 20%. US markets have also outperformed stocks in Europe and Asia across this year. “Inflation is waning, interest-rate cuts are in motion and earnings are trending higher, all which bolster sentiment and provide valuation support,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. The consensus among big banks and research analysts appears to be continued growth into 2025 amid strong economic data, earnings growth and expectations of a business-friendly Trump administration. Analysts expect the S&P 500 to rise by 14.8% in 2025, according to FactSet. But some analysts say stocks are currently overvalued, and uncertainty over the speed of future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve as well as looming geopolitical risks could spark a selloff. With such eye-watering gains in the past two years, it is uncertain whether the bull market can last. “We believe the chances of another positive year in 2025 are favorable given the high probability of economic growth and a Fed that is likely to cut rates next year,” Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a December 30 note. “But if resurgent inflation takes rate cuts off the table or speculation gets out of hand, this bull market could have a difficult time making it through next year.” December was the worst month since April for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, according to data from FactSet, as selloffs in tech stocks dragged the indices lower. Indeed, it’s rare to see three straight years of 20% gains in the stock market, according to Callie Cox, chief ma﻿rket strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Everybody’s expecting a good year next year, and that leaves a lot of room for disappointment,” Cox told CNN. In September, the Fed began cutting interest rates after holding them at decades-highs since the summer of 2023. The combination of the Fed beginning to cut rates and strong economic growth boded well for US equities. Cooling inflation boosted investor optimism, but after its final policy meeting of the year, the Fed signaled there will be fewer cuts in 2025 than previously expected, which could sap the market’s momentum next year. S&P 500 index: US tech companies had a standout year and drove the S&P 500 23.3% higher. The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — have accounted for over 50% of the S&P 500’s total returns this year, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. And, since November 5, the Mag Seven stocks have accounted for over 96% of the S&P 500’s gains. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was a top performer of the year, surging 179%. While Big Tech stocks boosted gains, stock market breadth has been poor. Most companies in the S&P 500 have fallen since November, while the index has been helped by the Magnificent Seven’s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Dow Jones Industrial Average: The Dow gained 12.9% across the year. The blue-chip index peaked at a record just above 45,000 points on December 4 before falling 5% in December. American chipmaker Nvidia joined the Dow in November. Nasdaq Composite: The Nasdaq surged higher by 28.6% in 2024. The tech-heavy index was the star of the major indices and surged on investor confidence in tech and AI. Palantir (PLTR), the AI-focused data company whose stock rose almost 340% this year, joined the Nasdaq in December. US Treasuries: The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note edged to 4.57% on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose by over 15% in 2024, signaling expectations of future economic growth and inflation. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note slid to 4.232% on Tuesday. The US dollar rose near the end of the year on expectations of economic growth. The US dollar surged after Trump’s reelection in November. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, is up over 7.1% across the year, according to data from FactSet. Bitcoin slid to $93,400 around by 4 p.m. on Tuesday and was down nearly 4% for the month. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has had a memorable year, surging by about 120% across 2024. That’s a turn of fortune from just two years ago, when bitcoin traded below $17,000 after the crypto industry imploded. Bitcoin — which is highly volatile — rallied this year as it continued to garner mainstream acceptance through Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrencies. Trump has tapped Paul Atkins, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto advocate, to be SEC chair. After Trump announced his pick, bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time. Gold also had a notable year, rising by 27% and outpacing the S&P 500. Investors often see gold as a safe haven against economic turmoil and inflation. When the Fed cuts rates, gold can become more appealing than income-paying assets like bonds. Gold’s rally, however, was also driven as central banks around the world continued to increase their gold reserves. Commodities: Which investment yielded the most surprising returns this year? Cocoa. Cocoa futures on the New York exchange surged more than 168% across the year. Futures prices for cocoa skyrocketed as climate issues disrupted cocoa harvests in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, where over 70% of global cocoa is produced. The squeeze in supply sent futures prices soaring. Futures for coffee and orange juice also surged this year due to erratic climate and poor outlooks for harvests. Futures contracts are often traded by institutional investors like big banks or asset management firms, as opposed to individual investors.

Title: The AI stocks that could boom in 2025

Big Tech stocks could have another big year in 2025. Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) could continue to be some of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence-driven stock boom, David Dietze, senior portfolio strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management, said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia — “the granddaddy of them all,” as Dietze puts it — soared more than 170% this year, giving it a roughly $3.3 trillion market capitalization as it rides tremendous revenue growth and overwhelming demand for its AI chips. Shares of e-commerce giant Amazon, which is also getting in on the chip game, surged more than 50%. Google parent Alphabet stock rose 40%, and Apple climbed more than 35%. The Magnificent 7 — Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for about a third of the S&P 500 index’s gains this year, largely powered by excitement around new AI technologies. But Goldman Sachs (GS) has warned that this “unusual degree of market concentration” could pose a major risk next year. Stocks that have benefited from the AI boom have largely done so independent of interest rates. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t in for a correction as the market settles from the post-presidential election rally. Dietze said that could happen in the not-so-distant future. “They’re riding a secular tailwind of extreme innovation that could plow right through that,” Dietze said. “Nevertheless, no sector operates in a silo or a vacuum. If everything else around them is struggling, they’re gonna struggle a little bit, too.” Dietze said one major theme for 2025 will be: show me the money. While major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have poured billions into AI partnerships and their own initiatives, investors are likely going to start looking for proof of returns next year, Dietze said. “Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday,” he said. “These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that.’” “And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year,” Dietze said.

Title: Bitcoin Revolution: NYDIG About To Unlock The Largest Capital Pool In Finance
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nydig-unlock-largest-capital-pool-finance/
Time Published: 2024-12-31T09:30:13Z
Full Content:
In a move that could reshape the Bitcoin lending market, Stone Ridge subsidiary NYDIG is gearing up to channel one of the biggest capital reservoirs in traditional finance—insurance float—into BTC-backed loans. The news, detailed in the 2024 Investor Letter from Stone Ridge CEO Ross Stevens, immediately attracted attention across the industry after its publication on December 30. Marathon Digital advisor Sam Callahan, commenting on X, framed the impact succinctly: “NYDIG is about to unlock one of the largest investable pools of capital in the entire financial system—insurance float—and channel it into Bitcoin-backed loans. This is a big deal.” According to Callahan, improved lending efficiency could lead to “lower loan costs,” reduced selling pressure on Bitcoin, and ultimately “increased scarcity” and “higher demand and price,” fueling more institutional interest and broader adoption. Ross Stevens’ 2024 Investor Letter outlines how NYDIG, which has already facilitated billions of dollars in BTC-collateralized loans, intends to expand by leveraging “float.” In insurance and asset management, float refers to investable capital held in reserve, often used to generate returns while maintaining coverage obligations. According to the letter: “Now that we know Bitcoin can generate cash flow upon a sale, how about using Bitcoin to generate cash flow upon a non-sale? […] Our Bitcoin subsidiary NYDIG is preparing to enable all HODLers, including Stone Ridge, to unsheathe their weapon – borrowed fiat at a low rate – in an amount, and at a time, that is right for them. […] Imagine floatpowered HODLing. […] Stay tuned.” Stone Ridge’s vision positions Bitcoin-collateralized lending as potentially on par with traditional stock margin loans—both in risk profile and, eventually, in pricing. According to the letter, BTC’s realized volatility over the past five years falls within the 40th to 80th percentile of the largest 3,000 US stocks, suggesting it is “about as risky as a typical US stock.” “That means Bitcoin-backed loans are realistically less, and certainly no more, risky than a plain vanilla, Reg T, US stock margin loan,”the letter states, pointing out that current bitcoin-backed loan rates—at “S + ~450 to ~950”—are out of line with the lower margin loan rates typical for stock financing. Stone Ridge projects a compression of this premium over time, pushing BTC-backed loans closer to the “Reg T margin loan neighborhood.” Insurance float, famously leveraged by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (which increased its float from $114 billion in 2017 to $164 billion as of December 31, 2022), represents a massive well of investable capital. While Berkshire uses its float to finance acquisitions and investments, Stone Ridge aims to unlock similar avenues for BTC collateralization. Bringing this vast capital supply into Bitcoin could generate a powerful network effect. Stone Ridge’s letter envisions a cycle where greater liquidity and lower costs prevent premature selling of BTC (“HODLing”), thereby reducing supply on the open market. This reduced supply, in turn, could bolster BTC’s price, driving more institutional interest and heightened adoption. Callahan’s emphasis on the ramifications for BTC holders and the broader ecosystem echoes Stone Ridge’s bullish outlook: “NYDIG is about to unlock one of the largest investable pools of capital in the entire financial system… This is a big deal.” If successful, the initiative would allow BTC investors to leverage their holdings without resorting to outright sales, preserving potential upside while accessing fiat liquidity. A more efficient lending market, Stone Ridge argues, would sustain Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative, further strengthening institutional confidence and opening the possibility of broader mainstream participation. At press time, BTC traded at $92,881. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed, as Tokyo and Seoul close for New Year holidays

Print Asian markets shares were mixed on Tuesday, with trading closed in Tokyo and Seoul for New Year holidays. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney skidded 0.9% to 8,159.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added nearly 0.1% to 20,059.95, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.7% to 3,383.86 after Chinese manufacturing data seemed to show that Beijing's stimulus measures have not done enough to boost the nation's sluggish economy. China's Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 50.1 in December from 50.3 the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. It was the third straight monthly reading above 50, a level that indicates an expansion of manufacturing activity. Trading is set to resume in Tokyo on January 6, as markets will stay closed for the rest of the week for the New Year holidays. South Korean markets will be closed for New Year's Day and resume trading Thursday. On Monday, U.S. stocks closed broadly lower, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% to 5,906.94, its third straight decline. Roughly 90% of stocks within the index lost ground. On the second-to-last day of 2024, the benchmark index was still on track for its second straight yearly gain of more than 20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% to 42,573.73, and the Nasdaq composite ended 1.2% lower, at 19,486.78. Big Tech companies were the heaviest weights on the market, worsening the slump. Apple and Microsoft fell 1.3%. Their pricey valuations tend to have an outsized impact on the broader market. Elsewhere among tech stocks, Meta Platforms dropped 1.4%, Netflix slipped 0.8% and Amazon fell 1.1%. The S&P 500's technology and communication services sectors have been the market's high flyers, notching gains of 37.1% and 39.9%, respectively, so far this year. Boeing fell 2.3% after one of its jets skidded off a runway in South Korea, killing 179 of the 181 people aboard. South Korea is inspecting all 737-800 aircraft operated by airlines in the country. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Its shares have declined more than 30% this year. Airlines that fly Boeing jets wavered in the wake of the crash. United Airlines fell 1.4% and Delta Air Lines dropped 0.9%. Markets are nearing the close of a stellar year driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Wall Street expects companies within the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Investors were encouraged by inflation cooling throughout the year to close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That raised hopes that the central bank would deliver a steady stream of interest rate cuts, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. The Fed cut interest rates three times in 2024, but has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 as inflation shows signs of reheating. The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation edged slightly higher, to 2.7%, in November. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to hike tariffs have added to worries about the potential for inflation to reignite. Companies typically pass along the higher costs from tariffs on goods and raw materials to consumers. Investors have very little corporate and economic news to review this week, which is shortened by the New Year holiday. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for the month of November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 62 cents to $71.61 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 59 cents to $74.58 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 156.22 Japanese yen from 156.90 yen. The euro cost $1.0409, little changed from $1.0410.

Title: Here’s Why Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) Is One of the Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is no longer overshadowed by Nvidia and is now emerging as a powerhouse with significant growth potential. The Broadcom surge is fueled by the company’s stellar fourth quarter performance, with revenue jumping 51% year-over-year to $14.05 billion, driven by AI solutions and the integration of VMware. Full-year revenue hit a record $51.6 billion, with infrastructure software contributing $21.5 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also returned to profitability, reporting $6.97 billion in adjusted net income for Q4. AI chips are poised to be Broadcom's primary growth driver.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) plans to deploy one million custom AI chips by 2027, targeting a market opportunity of $60–90 billion that year. On December 12, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) declared a $0.59 per share quarterly dividend, an 11.3% increase from its prior dividend of $0.53. The dividend is payable on December 31, to shareholders on record as of December 23.

Overall VYM ranks 8th on our list of the best performing dividend ETFs of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of VYM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The mission, titled "Owl The Way Up," launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, on December 22 at 03:17 NZT. Aboard the Electron rocket, the mission carried a StriX synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite into orbit for Synspective, a Japanese company specializing in Earth observation. The deployment was part of a broader agreement involving 16 launches for Synspective, which has relied exclusively on Rocket Lab for its satellite constellation since 2020. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, stated: "Mission success once again for Synspective, capping off our busiest launch year to date. We look forward to continuing to increase our launch cadence in the new year as we strengthen Electron's position as the leading small rocket globally, and also enter the medium launch market with Neutron's debut. In 2024 we launched missions for NASA, the NRO, deployed multiple missions for commercial constellation operators like Synspective, launched suborbital HASTE missions advancing hypersonic flight test capability, and to top it all off, we achieved a world first by launching two missions from two different hemispheres in less than 24 hours. Thank you and congratulations to the Rocket Lab team, our customers, and our mission partners for another stellar year." Rocket Lab's 16 successful missions in 2024 surpassed its previous annual record of 10 launches in 2023. The company also maintained a perfect mission success rate throughout the year.

Title: AMD's Next Big Move: Northland Names It a Top Pick for 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Recently, Northland analysts reiterated their Outperform rating for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD. Financial) and set a price target a price target of $175, or nearly a 40% upside from Tuesday's $125 close. Northland has AMD among its top picks for 2025 because it is also a confidence play, as the firm should be able to increase market share in AI GPUs, server CPUs, and PC clients. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMD. Embedded gaming remains one of the headwinds for AMD, and its strategic roadmap is to overcome the respective headwinds and take full advantage of the growing demand for AI-driven technology. The projections say AI-related revenue could reach up to $5.2 billion by 2024 and increase to $9.5 billion by 2025, indicating solid growth potential. AMD's Turin CPUs also beat Intel's Granite Rapids in data center workloads, which is a big driver of its expected 10% growth in non-AI data center revenue to $8.5 billion in 2025. Also on the cusp of a possible PC market refresh cycle is the phase-out of Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) support for Windows 10, which could help push AMD client revenue up by 25%, year over year, to $7.9B in 2025, driven by upside potential. Despite the challenges in the gaming and embedded markets, Northland forecasts gaming revenues to remain flat, and embedded revenue is expected to return to $4 billion in 2025. The recent $333 million investment in AI cloud startup Vultr continues the company's focus on developing AI infrastructure and pushes its edge in the GPU market even further alongside Nvidia. AMD is positioned strongly financially and has a forward-looking innovation focus that is worth watching in the tech space. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%. Big Tech stocks led this year’s rally, pushing the Nasdaq to a yearly gain of 28.6%. The Dow, which is far less weighted with tech, rose 12.9% for the year. The stock market's record-breaking turn in 2024 was “certainly much better that what most people on Wall Street, myself included, thought we would get this year,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. U.S. markets’ stellar run was driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Skyrocketing prices for companies in the artificial-intelligence business, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, helped lift the market to new heights. Solid corporate earnings growth also helped. Wall Street expects companies in the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Another boost for the market: The economy avoided a recession that many on Wall Street worried was inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked its main interest rate to a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy to beat high inflation. Receding inflation, which has gotten closer to the Fed’s 2% target, helped energize Wall Street, raising hopes that the central bank would deliver multiple interest rate cuts into next year, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. Still, after three interest rate cuts in 2024, the Fed has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 with inflation remaining sticky as the country prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to transition into the White House. Trump’s threats to hike tariffs on imported goods have raised anxiety that inflation could be reignited as companies pass along the higher costs from tariffs. This year’s market rally went beyond stocks. Bitcoin, which was below $17,000 just two years ago, climbed above $100,000 for the first time. And gold also shattered records on its way to a 27.4% gain for the year. Only about 38% of the stocks in the S&P 500 fell Tuesday, but a slide in technology stocks outweighed gains elsewhere in the market. Semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, fell 2.3%. Apple dropped 0.7%, and Advanced Micro Devices gave up 1.3%. Gains in energy stocks helped temper some of the declines. Exxon Mobil rose 1.7% and Chevron gained 1.2%. VeriSign rose 0.9% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had increased its stake in the internet domain registry services company. All told, the S&P 500 fell 25.31 points to 5,881.63 on Tuesday. The Dow lost 29.51 points to close at 42,544.22, and the Nasdaq slid 175.99 points to finish at 19,310.79. The market's mini post-Christmas slump doesn't bode well for a ‘Santa Claus’ rally, the term for when U.S. stock indexes get a boost in the last five trading days of a year, plus the first two in the new year. Such a rally correlates closely with positive returns in January and the upcoming year. Even so, missing out on the Santa Rally isn’t necessarily a negative omen. “Historically, a negative Santa Claus rally still resulted in an average gain of almost 6% in the subsequent year,” Stovall said. Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.57% from 4.54% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury held steady at 4.24%. Crude oil prices rose 1%. Indexes in Europe mostly rose. Asian markets ended mixed, with exchanges in Tokyo and Seoul closed for New Year holidays. Markets will be closed on Wednesday for the New Year’s Day holiday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close their equity and options markets on Jan. 9 in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, continuing a long-held Wall Street tradition in mourning the nation’s leaders. The 39th U.S. president and global humanitarian died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old. Sign in to access your portfolio
