Plus: DeepSeek’s Debut Chills Markets, Trump Remakes IRS And Tax Policy In His Image, DEI Wins And Loses, Boeing’s Bad 2024 Continues A Trend Of Losses Monday was one of the worst days the Nasdaq has seen in two years, thanks to a massive tech selloff. Chinese AI model DeepSeek, an apparently self-funded platform that reportedly cost just $5.6 million to train, and which was likely developed with less powerful chips than those behind U.S.-based models from companies including OpenAI, made many U.S. tech investors pause and pull back. DeepSeek, which outperformed some OpenAI models, showed the U.S. that a Chinese tech company could become a frontrunner in the race to develop generative AI platforms, despite extensive restrictions placed on U.S. tech exports by former president Joe Biden to prevent that. Investor and billionaire Marc Andreessen wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model is “AI’s Sputnik moment,” Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava and Richard Nieva wrote. DeepSeek pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3% on Monday, but individual companies saw much deeper losses. Nvidia, which makes the processors that power the U.S.’s AI revolution, saw its stock fall nearly 17% on Monday, setting records by shedding nearly $589 billion in the company’s market value. In a statement, Nvidia called DeepSeek’s model an “excellent AI advancement” that actually does use “significant numbers” of Nvidia’s GPUs, but they’re less powerful ones made for use in China that are “fully export control compliant.” Nvidia wasn’t the only company to see a big loss on Monday driven by DeepSeek. Chipmakers Broadcom saw a 17% one-day drop, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose stock fell 13%, were also hurt by the news. The markets slowly began recovering Tuesday, but increases were more gradual. There’s long been speculation that AI companies were becoming overvalued. Nvidia rocketed from a company that made graphics cards for video games to the leading player in AI hardware—and now with eyes on self-driving cars, robotics and smart warehouses—in a matter of years, and has at times been the world’s most valuable company. While Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Apple have several other services, company progress on AI has played an outsized role as in how their shares have performed. And private companies including OpenAI—valued at $157 billion—and Anthropic—worth $6 billion after a pending $2 billion funding round is finalized—are pulling in dollars and influence. According to Crunchbase, close to a third of all global venture funding in 2024 went to companies in AI-related fields, totaling more than $100 billion. Is this the beginning of the burst of the AI bubble? It could be. Before DeepSeek impacted U.S. markets, Forbes contributor Abdo Riani compared AI to the tech bubble a generation ago, when early dot-com companies quickly went from ballooning fortunes to struggling to keep the lights on. The dot-com bubble was fueled by investor over-optimism in the power of the internet, overlooking rational considerations of what the technology could do and deliver. The companies that survived the bubble’s burst, including Amazon, Google and eBay, Riani wrote, used the technology to bring specific values and usage to the technology. The stock market leader of two years from now may be a company that can use AI to make a difference through AI-powered agents, or mostly autonomous robots and vehicles. But maybe it will still be Nvidia, which will continue creating the hardware for AI, and has a good track record of recovering from drastic swings in its value. The CFO’s role in a company is always evolving. I talked to Megan Weis, vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, and host of a weekly CFO podcast, about the changes she’s seeing in the job. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump speaks at a White House news conference last week. Taxes are important to Donald Trump, and he’s pressing forward with remaking the IRS in his policy likeness. Former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel officially left the department on January 20, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb, clearing a path for Trump nominee Billy Long to take over. IRS commissioners serve five-year terms and are generally not replaced as administrations change. Werfel’s term wasn’t up until late 2027. No confirmation hearings appear to be scheduled for Long, a former congressman and Trump loyalist with no direct background in tax policy. Among his day one executive orders, Trump put a 90-day federal hiring freeze in place throughout the government so the new Department of Government Efficiency could figure out the correct size of the government workforce. However, the IRS hiring freeze seems more permanent, and will remain in place until the Treasury secretary determines it’s in the national interest to lift it, Phillips Erb writes. Biden boosted the IRS’s personnel funding in order to provide better and faster service to taxpayers, as well as to pursue high-wealth individuals, large corporations and complex partnerships to ensure they are paying their fair share. In November and December 2023, the IRS offered positions to more than 560 new accountants. This week, Phillips Erb writes, job offers have been rescinded to job candidates with start dates after February 8. Trump has also talked about firing existing IRS employees, aiming at the 87,000 new IRS workers—for positions ranging from customer service and IT to enforcement—that would be hired over the next decade through 2023’s Inflation Reduction Act. “They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,” he told a crowd last week at the Circa Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Phillips Erb reported. While Trump passed large tax cuts in his first term and has said extending—or even increasing—them is a priority in his second, Republicans in Congress are hashing out the best way to do that. Trump has said he wants everything in one bill so it’s easier to get everything that is wanted. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary on Monday, so the leadership to enact those cuts is now in place. As far as international taxes, Trump also issued a memo saying that any commitment made under the Biden administration to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with respect to the Global Tax Deal will not be followed. The OECD determines how international corporations are taxed by all countries, and Trump’s memo says that Congress will work toward a more America first tax policy, Phillips Erb writes. A Costco store in Richmond, California. As some companies rein in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts—last week, Target joined the list of companies scaling back policies to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women—others are doubling down on them. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. However, business DEI policies may be thrust in an uncomfortable spotlight by Trump, who opposes the policy. He signed a day one executive order ending federal DEI programs, saying that the “illegal and immoral” plans “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” Another executive order brings this crackdown to the private sector by rescinding a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Trump is now requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. The fuselage and one of the engines of a Boeing 777-9 jetliner aircraft on the tarmac at Dubai World Central - Al-Maktoum International Airport. With a shocking in-flight plane malfunction, a rejected plea deal for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and a seven-week machinists strike halting production, Boeing had a terrible 2024—posting a stunning $11.8 billion loss. But, Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky writes, that’s actually part of a pattern for Boeing. The aircraft company is on a six-year losing streak, and is likely to have lost a total of $35.7 billion in that time period. Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that activist investors—including investment titan Warren Buffett—may be looking closely at Boeing as a potential target. Personiv Vice President and General Manager of Finance & Accounting Outsourcing Services Megan Weis. As vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, Megan Weis has her finger on the pulse of how the CFO’s profession is changing. She also talks with different CFOs about their work in her CFO Weekly podcast. I talked to her about the CFO’s evolution in 2025. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you see the CFO’s role continuing to evolve in 2025? Weis: I can’t have a conversation these days without hearing about generative AI. It’s still pretty nascent. Most smaller to mid-size companies are experimenting with some things here and there at the moment, whereas enterprise companies are using it to turn data into actionable insights. Technology is going to continue to evolve. Cybersecurity is becoming a huge issue these days, and CFOs are becoming more and more responsible for managing that risk. Hackers are becoming more clever, and the risks are just becoming more and more. Globally, it’s becoming very unstable. We have supply chain issues, there are currency fluctuations, inflationary concerns. It’s becoming more complex. Soft skills are becoming and more and more of a requirement. The CFO role is like a ringleader; it’s very collaborative. The CFO is becoming more responsible for communicating across the organization, and that ties back to the idea of being the storyteller. With so much data out there, it’s becoming increasingly necessary to digest that data, turn it into actionable insights, and be able to communicate it back to the organization in a way that finance or non-finance and accounting people can understand, whether that be employees or investors. How did the evolution to CFO-as-storyteller begin, and what stories can the CFO tell that a company would miss otherwise? It started when the CFO role started gearing toward being more of a strategic role, or a right hand to the CEO. The CFO is becoming more responsible for bridging the gap between finance and other departments. They’re responsible for collaborating. A lot of them throughout their career are stepping out of finance for a time and concentrating more in operational areas. [It’s important] being able to communicate to investors [and] employees, and really humanizing financial data. At this point, there’s just so much data that's available to finance and accounting and the CFO that you really have to take that data, boil it down, digest it, tell a story with it, and then align that story with the culture and the objectives of the organization. In general, the world is looking for more transparency. They’re looking for organizations who stand for something, and that’s part of where the storytelling comes in. People want to work for organizations that are purpose-driven and where the stories align, whether that be the stories they’re trying to sell to investors or the story that their financial data is telling. Transparency is becoming more and more critical. Historically, CFOs have been more of a news reporter. They’ve taken historical data and regurgitated it back to investors and companies, whereas today, they’re more forward-looking, more strategic. They still have to get the numbers, but they’re helping to shape the story more than just report the news. How do fractional CFOs work, and how often are they being used? Fractional CFOs are something that I hadn’t really heard about before I’d started this podcast. I do think that they are becoming more prevalent. They’ve grown over the last decade or so, and they’re being used a lot for small and mid-size businesses who can’t afford a full-time CFO, but still need the guidance of someone with experience being a CFO. The fractional CFO plays really well into the gig economy: People wanting a portfolio of work, and maybe not just relying on one employee to be their employee for their entire career. That’s not the way things work anymore. An employe[r] might not hold on to you for your entire career. Building a portfolio of clients for CFOs is the route that they want to go. Also, with more PE-backed companies, those PE firms are looking for CFOs, and someone with the experience of a CFO to help make strategic decisions for those organizations, help guide them through growth periods. I also think fractional CFOs play a big part in a company being able to be agile and pull in experts when those experts are needed. Every company goes through different stages, whether that be growth or crisis, and I think the fractional CFO allows those small companies to be agile and pull in the right talent when it’s needed. Unionized employees at Costco voted to go on strike when their contract expires on January 31. The company has rejected union proposals for increased seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time and safeguards against surveillance. 18,000: Number of Costco employees represented by the Teamsters union—about 8% of the warehouse retailer’s full workforce 26%: Costco’s profit growth since the current union contract, signed in 2022 ‘Costco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it’s failing to live up to that reputation’: Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, said in a statement To be a leader that employees, colleagues and investors trust, it’s important to be authentic. Here are 12 skills that can improve your authenticity. Collaboration can yield the most innovative ideas. Here are examples of collaborative successes at some companies.

Title: $1.9 B flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Trump’s first week – Details
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/1-9-b-flows-into-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-in-trumps-first-week-details/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T17:00:07Z

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw $1.9 billion in weekly inflows as Trump’s pro-market stance fueled investor enthusiasm and momentum. In the first week of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, the U.S. witnessed an extraordinary surge in investment activity, with approximately $1.9 billion funneled into spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This influx reflects the growing momentum behind the so-called “Trump Trade” phenomenon, as investors rally around the administration’s pro-market stance. According to SoSoValue data, BTC ETFs recorded $517.67 million in net inflows by the 24th of January, contributing to $1.76 billion total for the week—extending the $1.96 billion influx observed before Trump’s inauguration. The week closed strongly for Bitcoin ETFs, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading by securing $186.07 million in net inflows on the 24th Jof anuary. This pushed its cumulative inflows to $13.04 billion, elevating its net assets to $22.5 billion. FBTC now stands as the second-best-performing Bitcoin fund. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB followed closely, attracting $168.71 million in net inflows, bringing its total to $2.96 billion, with net assets of $5.41 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT dominated the BTC ETF landscape, amassing $155.69 million in inflows. This drove its cumulative inflows to $39.73 billion, securing $60.62 billion in net assets. Smaller contributions came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, recording $13.01 million, and the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW), posting $2.79 million. The only outlier was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, experiencing $8.6 million in outflows, contrasting the otherwise bullish sentiment. Ethereum ETFs experienced modest gains last week, with $9.18 million in net inflows, bringing the cumulative total for the week to $139.32 million. This followed a more robust pre-inauguration week, which saw $211.97 million in inflows. Interestingly, top performers like BlackRock and Fidelity were notably absent from the day’s results, leaving room for smaller funds to take the spotlight. Leading the charge, Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF (ETHW) secured $6.01 million in inflows, boosting its cumulative total to $351.69 million. Other funds like the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH) and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) also saw modest inflows of $1.99 million and $1.17 million, respectively. This subdued performance has raised questions about ETH’s positioning compared to BTC, which appears to be drawing more attention from investors as a safer or more promising bet. Nonetheless, Ethereum ETFs have seen substantial institutional interest, attracting over $5 billion since November 2024. With use cases in DeFi and tokenized assets, Ethereum’s potential continues to offer diverse opportunities, positioning it for long-term growth despite current market fluctuations. As ETH ETFs continue to gain traction, they may exert pressure on Bitcoin’s dominance, especially as institutions explore Ethereum’s broader applications. However, the latest data from Farside Investors shows that both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs faced outflows on the 27th of January. Bitcoin saw $456.7 million in exits, while Ethereum ETF shed $136.2 million. This raises questions about whether the bullish trend triggered by the Trump administration will be sustained or prove short-lived. Therefore, the evolution of these ETFs remains uncertain. Investors will be closely watching to see if the recent momentum continues or stalls.

Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in the data centers and infrastructure needed to train and deploy AI software across their various services. But China’s DeepSeek upended the general thinking that developing AI models requires the use of the most powerful, and expensive, chips with the release of its R1 model on Jan. 20. The model, the company claims, was trained on systems that were less powerful and less expensive than those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). The company’s app shot to the top of the App Store over the weekend, driving a huge amount of interest in the relatively small firm and clobbering American AI stocks, including AI bellwether Nvidia. Now Microsoft will have to prove not only that its own AI work is paying off in terms of increased revenue but also that its hefty infrastructure investments are truly necessary. For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, is expected to come in at $41.1 billion. That would be an increase from the $31.9 billion the company reported in Q2 last year. Its intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, is set to come in at $25.8 billion, up from $21.5 billion. In a note to investors, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he believes Azure growth will begin to reaccelerate in the second half of 2025. “Our checks continue to indicate improving consumption/core cloud trends,” he wrote. “Also, [Microsoft] just announced that ‘OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training.’ ” While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, however, says the stock could be set up for a “mini revenge trade” as AI sales increase, its Copilot adoption rate improves, and capital expenditure moderates, creating more free cash flow.

Title: Why Everyone Is Freaking Out About DeepSeek, China’s Answer to ChatGPT

Time Published: 2025-01-28T16:27:57Z

By Miles Klee Years of feverish hype around artificial intelligence technology have convinced many that it’s Silicon Valley‘s next speculative bubble — and prompted questions of how long giants like OpenAI can keep burning through billions of dollars in their quest for a true breakthrough AI. Now, a Chinese company has unveiled a cutting-edge AI model that it says it developed in under two months, with end-stage training costs of less than $6 million, figures that significantly undercut the levels of investment from U.S. firms in bots such as ChatGPT and the infrastructure to run them. And the market may never be the same. DeepSeek — the name of both the lab and its model — emerged as a side project of Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of the hedge fund High-Flyer, who began importing processing chips from Nvidia in 2021 for the project. (The California-based manufacturer is a major supplier of the high-performance graphic processing units, or GPUs, hardware that provides the tremendous computing power necessary to train and run AI.) In 2023, High-Flyer launched a version of DeepSeek as an internal tool to help identify and predict market trends to improve its trading decisions. But last week, the company released an “AI assistant” bot, DeepSeek-V3, a large language model that has since become the most-downloaded free app on Apple devices (ahead of OpenAI’s ChatGPT), and a reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, that it claims hits the same benchmarks as OpenAI’s comparable model. The lab has also debuted a multimodal model capable of generating images that appears to outperform competitors DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion. These various upstarts alone might have sent ripples through venture capital firms and major tech players that have bet billions on AI, including Microsoft, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. What really shook these investors on Monday, however, was the efficiency touted by DeepSeek: it reportedly uses a limited number of reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia, in turn substantially lowering operating costs and the price of premium models for consumers. By contrast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged just weeks ago that the company loses money even on pro subscriptions that cost $200 a month, thanks to the astronomical cost of the processing power their software requires. With an alleged price tag of around $5.5 million for its final phase of development, DeepSeek-V3 also represents a relatively cheap alternative to models that have cost tens of millions to engineer. On top of all that, DeepSeek’s codes are actually open-source, freely available for users to distribute and modify, or run on a private device without giving away personal data. U.S. firms, meanwhile, tend to keep the inner workings of their AIs cloaked in as much secrecy as possible. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The upshot of all this was a sudden loss of faith in industry leaders, including several who are collaborating on a $500 billion project to expand AI infrastructure under President Trump, known as the Stargate Initiative. The chipmaker Nvidia was hardest hit, losing $600 billion in market capitalization as its share price plummeted 17 percent — the largest single-day drop for a U.S. corporation in history. This sell-off indicated a sense that the next wave of AI models may not require the tens of thousands of top-end GPUs that Silicon Valley behemoths have amassed into computing superclusters for the purposes of accelerating their AI innovation. Sharply reduced demand for chips and massive data centers like those Trump has proposed under Stargate (in an announcement that propelled AI stocks higher just days ago) could entirely reshape this sector of the economy. By Monday’s market close, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock market index had shed an incredible $1 trillion from its value on Friday. Of course, DeepSeek’s big splash also made it a target, and the company limited registration on Monday during what it called “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services (though without limiting access to existing users). At the same time, certain analysts argued that the market panic about the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. in the AI race could be an overreaction. After all, DeepSeek may point the way for increased efficiency in American-made models, some investors will buy in during this dip, and, as a Chinese company, DeepSeek faces some of the same national security concerns that have bedeviled ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok.

To some observers, it will start to appear that such spending is not only unsustainable but ultimately wasteful, considering how much a foreign startup has accomplished with far less.

Title: China's DeepSeek chatbot reportedly gets much more done with fewer GPUs but Nvidia still thinks it's 'excellent' news

Nvidia claims more AI from fewer chips is good for business. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. China's new DeepSeek R1 language model has been shaking things up by reportedly matching or even beating the performance of established rivals including OpenAI while using far fewer GPUs. Nvidia's response? R1 is "excellent" news that proves the need for even more of its AI-accelerating chips. If you're thinking the math doesn't immediately add up, the stock market agrees, what with $600 billion being wiped off Nvidia's share price this week. So, let's consider a few facts for a moment. Reuters reports that DeepSeek's development entailed 2,000 of Nvidia's H800 GPUs and a training budget of just $6 million, while CNBC claims that R1 "outperforms" the best LLMs from the likes of OpenAI and others. The H800 is a special variant of Nvidia's Hopper H100 GPU that's been hobbled to fit within the US's export restriction rules for AI chips. Some in the AI industry claim that China generally and DeepSeek, in particular, have managed to dodge the export rules and acquire large numbers of Nvidia's more powerful H100 GPUs, but Nvidia has denied that claim. Meanwhile, it's thought OpenAI used 25,000 of Nvidia's previous-gen A100 chips to train ChatGPT 4. It's hard to compare the A100 to the H800 directly, but it certainly seems like DeepSeek got more done with fewer GPUs. That's why the market got the yips when it comes to Nvidia. Maybe we don't need quite as many chips for the AI revolution as was once thought? Needless to say, Nvidia doesn't see it that way, lauding R1 for demonstrating how the so-called "Test Time" scaling technique can help create more powerful AI models. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” the company told CNBC. "DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, all may not be quite as it seems. As Andy reported yesterday, some observers think DeepSeek is actually spending more like $500 million to $1 billion a year. But the general consensus is that DeepSeek is getting more done for much less investment than the established players. Microsoft, for instance, expects to spend $80 billion on AI hardware this year, with Meta saying it will unload $60 to $65 billion. DeepSeek's R1 model seems to imply that similar results can be achieved for an order of magnitude less investment. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. The question is, does that automatically mean fewer GPUs being bought? Perhaps not. At the kind of investment levels demonstrated by the likes of Microsoft and Meta, the number of organisations that can get involved is necessarily limited. It's just too expensive. Cut that by a tenth or more and suddenly the number of potential participants might explode. And they'll all want GPUs. It's a little like the move from mainframe to personal computing. Sure, each individual investment in computing was a lot smaller, but the computing business overall grew far larger. So, maybe DeepSeek is an inflection point. From here on, AI development is more accessible, less dominated by a small number of hugely wealthy entities, and maybe even a bit more democratic. Or maybe we'll find out that DeepSeek has used a mountain of H100s after all. Either way, Nvidia will be planning to make its own mountain—of cash.

Or maybe he just likes machines that go “ping!” He also has a thing for tennis and cars. FSR 4 may be a simple upgrade for FSR 3.1 games according to leaks, which hopefully means we won't see a repeat of FSR 3's poorly-supported launch MSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia NZXT Capsule Elite review PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Zuckerberg Convening Huge "War Rooms" to Figure Out How a Chinese Startup Is Annihilating Meta's AI

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scrambling after a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek turned Silicon Valley upside down with its chatbot app. The company's latest R1 AI model can run circles around the competition from Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic — and at a tiny fraction of the cost. Despite some skepticism over DeepSeek's claims, the debut has led to some serious soul-searching among AI investors, with the ChatGPT competitor wiping out an estimated $1 trillion in value among other AI companies on Monday. In the most extreme example, AI chipmaker Nvidia set a new record for the biggest single-day loss of any company in history. Among others, the app appears to have caught Meta with its pants down. In response, the company assembled several"war rooms" of engineers, The Information reports, in a desperate attempt to get ahead of the situation. The war rooms are now hard at work, analyzing DeepSeek and looking for possible changes to make to Meta's flagship AI, Llama. And according to the report, engineers are already afraid that the next version of the AI won't be able to compete with the Chinese AI — early indications that this week's chaos might represent the new status quo, rather than a momentary blip as investors find their new footing. "The main frustration is, ‘Why didn’t we come up with this first?' when we have thousands of the brightest minds working on this," one Meta employee told the Financial Times. After trading resumed on Tuesday, Nvidia's share price ricocheted around a bit, but fell far short of recovery. Meanwhile, Meta's stock has largely been unaffected and is up just over seven percent over the last five days, with investors arguing that DeepSeek could bring positive changes to the platform's AI efforts. A notable quality that Llama and DeepSeek share is that they're both open-source, which means developers have unfettered access to the underlying code. But Llama has historically struggled to keep up with the offerings from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Now that DeepSeek has thrown the gauntlet in front of the latter two, it'll be interesting to see if Meta can pull ahead. Over the weekend, Zuckerberg committed a whopping $60 billion to AI-related capital expenditures this year alone. In short, the company is all in, intensifying its efforts to keep up with the soaring competition. The war rooms are looking to combine several AI models into one more fully featured system, much like DeepSeek. But whether its efforts will pay off — lowering computing costs for Llama while simultaneously making it more useful — is anyone's guess. Remember when Zuckerberg was all in on the metaverse?

Manage your account For the second time in the last month, a Chinese app has skyrocketed to the top spot in Apple’s App Store. The first was Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, which saw a sudden surge in downloads by United States users seeking an alternative to TikTok in anticipation of the ban on that app, which had been scheduled to take effect on Jan. 19. Now it’s DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company that released a new chatbot model called R1 on Jan. 20. The DeepSeek app has since climbed to the top of the Apple App charts, recording more than 1.6 million downloads since it launched on Jan. 10, according to the market tracker App Figures. DeepSeek announced Monday that it is temporarily restricting new users from signing up for its services, citing “large-scale malicious attacks.” But prior to that, the Chinese startup and its new chatbot seemed on track to surpass the popularity of U.S.-based AI companies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini. At a House Republican retreat in Miami on Monday, Trump called the initial success of DeepSeek’s R1 model “very much a positive development” because “instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” He then added it should also be seen as a “wake-up call” for U.S.-based tech companies to develop “a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Here’s what to know. DeepSeek was founded in May 2023, by leaders at the Chinese hedge fund, High-Flyer. The company launched its first AI model chatbot, R1, on Jan. 20. In posts on X, fans of R1 have praised the chatbot’s responses as “human-like” and quick, praising the fact that the app is available for free and that users need not have coding experience to understand how to operate it. In addition to its sudden popularity on the App Store, DeepSeek has attracted attention for its relatively small staff and budget, as compared with the sums American companies have spent on AI development. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend, DeepSeek launched R1 with a team of less than 200 people and only spent $5.6 million to train its AI models. By comparison, last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his social media conglomerate would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in AI development this year. In 2024, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said the tech industry would need to spend “trillions” on the computer chips used to power AI. Altman called DeepSeek’s R1 “an impressive model” especially “for the price” in a post on X. “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” he wrote. Like other Chinese platforms, there are signs of censorship on DeepSeek on certain topics that are considered sensitive in China, such as questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or China's President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek’s success appears to challenge the idea that the U.S. has control of the AI industry. Concerns about this potential threat to U.S. dominance in the field seemed to be reflected on Wall Street Monday, with stocks falling for massive tech giants like Nvidia, Meta and Google’s parent company, Alphabet. In particular, the company’s claim that it built its AI model at a much lower cost compared to other, similar AI platforms seems to be causing panic in the stock market. Yahoo Finance reported that Nvidia, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, and which builds computer chips for AI, lost a record $589 billion in market capitalization yesterday. The net worth of Nvidia’s CEO and biggest shareholder, Jensen Huang, fell $20.8 billion. Read more about the stock market reaction from Yahoo Finance: AI-exposed power stocks get crushed as fears about DeepSeek trigger stock market sell-off In the past, Washington has banned exporting higher-end technologies to China in hopes of stalling China’s advances in AI. A week before leaving office, Biden’s administration proposed a new framework for restricting U.S. exports of AI computer chips, to prevent countries like China from accessing the advanced technology. “If it’s China and not the United States determining the future of AI on the planet, I think that the stakes of that are just profound," former White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at the time. At the House Republican retreat this week, Trump said he hoped DeepSeek’s success would remind U.S. tech companies that “we need to be laser-focused on competing.” Trump has signed an executive order on AI to repeal any government policies that “act as barriers to American AI innovation” and, on Jan. 21, announced that his administration was closely working with the Oracle Corporation, OpenAI and SoftBank on his $500 billion AI venture, “Stargate.” At her first press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the National Security Council is "looking into" any potential security concerns related to DeepSeek. Leavitt said that while Trump feels confident that "we'll restore American dominance" in the AI field, DeepSeek's success is because the Biden administration "sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program." (DeepSeek had obtained some of its advanced chips for AI programming before former President Joe Biden's executive order restricting AI chip exports to Chinese tech companies went into effect.)

Its competitors have already spent big on their own efforts. The sudden rise of a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek sent U.S. tech stocks tumbling Monday. DeepSeek says it created an artificial intelligence model in much less time and for much less money than U.S. companies. President Trump called it a "wake-up call." CBS News MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady has more. Greener Pastures News of Chinese AI company DeepSeek's success continues to send ripples throughout the West, tanking Nvidia's stock valuation, spawning endless discourse, and embarrassing President Trump. Now, American startup gurus are starting to jump ship.

The struggling company ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger last month and named two interim co-CEOs, casting doubts about its plans to build out a contract chip manufacturing business — a strategy championed by Gelsinger. Investors want to know, "What is the strategic plan to bring Intel back from the ashes?" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares of the chipmaker.

Title: China heralds DeepSeek as a symbol of AI advancements amid U.S. restrictions

LIVE: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Senate confirmation hearing Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — An artificial intelligence lab in China has become the latest front in the U.S.-China rivalry, raising doubts as to how much — and for how much longer — the United States is in the lead in developing the strategically key technology. The Chinese startup DeepSeek has made waves after releasing AI models that experts say match or outperform leading American models at a fraction of the cost. The meteoric rise of the previously little-known company spooked U.S. investors Monday, wiping out almost $600 billion in the market value of American chipmaker Nvidia in the biggest drop in the nation's market history. In China, DeepSeek is being heralded as a symbol of the country’s AI advancements in the face of U.S. export restrictions that Beijing says are aimed at suppressing its technological development. “This jaw-dropping breakthrough has come from a purely Chinese company,” said Feng Ji, founder and chief executive of Game Science, the developer behind the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong. “DeepSeek may be a national-level technological and scientific achievement,” he wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Zhou Hongyi, co-founder of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, said China would “undoubtedly come out on top” in the U.S.-China AI race. “If we are to counter America’s AI tech dominance, DeepSeek will definitely be a key member of China’s ‘Avengers team,’” he said in a video on Weibo. So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation? Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies. Liang has said High-Flyer was one of DeepSeek’s investors, though it’s unclear how much it contributed, as well as a source of some of its first employees. “Our core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,” he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for “down-to-earth individuals with curiosity.” By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia’s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year. Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of “curiosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities” and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind. The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek’s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called “AI’s Sputnik moment.” Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies. The comparatively small spend by DeepSeek showed "a lot of optimization and smart, capable engineering that can be implemented and deployed to keep up in this race," Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies, told NBC News. The surge in interest sent DeepSeek’s recently released app to the top of Apple’s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations “due to large-scale malicious attacks” on its services, CNBC reported. New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The R1 model is now second only to California-based OpenAI’s o1 in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. It also beats leading models by Google, Meta and the California-based Anthropic. Liang, who according to the China's media is about 40, has kept a relatively low profile in the country, where there has been a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years amid concerns by the ruling Chinese Communist Party that its biggest companies and executives might be getting too powerful. But he appeared on state television last week during a high-profile meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, who invited Liang and other experts from technology, education, science and other fields to share their opinions for a draft government work report. At the meeting, Li called for “technological innovation” to foster the economy, according to state media reports. China has made AI a national priority, with the goal of becoming the global leader in its technology by 2030. The U.S., concerned about the potential military applications, has moved to limit China's access to American technology, including new restrictions on AI chips issued by Joe Biden in the final days of his presidency. President Donald Trump said Monday that DeepSeek’s rise “should be a wake-up call” for U.S. tech companies. The Chinese Foreign Ministry referred a request for comment Tuesday to the relevant department. R1 has also drawn attention because, unlike OpenAI’s o1, it is free to use and open-source, meaning anyone can study and copy how it was made. Most Chinese engineers are eager for their open-source projects to be used by foreign companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, in part because “no one in the West respects what they do because everything in China is stolen or created by cheating,” said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in AI. “They are also aware that Chinese firms have been taking for free lots of open-source tech to advance,” Xu, the former senior director for global expansion at GitHub, said Monday in a post on X, “but they want to create their own, contribute, and prove that their tech is good enough to be taken for free by foreign firms — some nationalism, some engineering pride.” DeepSeek is not the only Chinese AI startup that says it can train models for a fraction of the price. Kai-Fu Lee, founder of 01.AI, has said that it cost $3 million to train its model and that U.S. restrictions on chip exports forced his company to innovate. “The Chinese companies are able to watch the innovations, make some themselves and then do better engineering,” Lee, a former president of Google China, said at a conference in Saudi Arabia in October. “When you do excellent, detailed engineering, it is not the case you have to spend a billion dollars to train a great model.” Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.

Title: Why Verizon is excited about AI Connect

Jan 28, 2025 While US tech giants suffered unprecedented share price carnage on Monday, with investors spooked by China’s generative AI (GenAI) newcomer Deepseek, Verizon, which only days earlier launched its AI Connect strategy saw its share price rise unobtrusively by a modest 3% to $40.68. True, the uplift appears to be mainly because the US telco posted a decent set of fourth-quarter results, fuelled by strong wireless subscriber growth, but investors may well have also been reassured that AI Connect, which is aimed at supporting growing demand for AI workloads deployed at scale, largely involves “re-imagining” existing datacentre assets and fibre infrastructure rather than relying on massive capex splurges on spanking new infrastructure. AI Connect will inevitably need some extra investment, but Kyle Malady, CEO of Verizon Business, when fielding questions from financial analysts on Verizon’s Q4 earnings conference call (as transcribed by Motley Fool), seemed to indicate that the money already spent (“to tweak assets”) and future capital requirements would not be significant, at least in the wider capex scheme of things. “[For] some of these [AI workload] deals, what we’ll have to do is spend some capital to edge out our fibre a little bit to go meet people at the right datacentres and/or locations of business and then [retrofit] technical space,” he said. “So, we have money in that, but we’re ready to go with that. It’s all included in the [capex] envelope.” If Malady was coy about AI Connect’s capex requirements, his AI bashfulness disappeared when talking about potential financial opportunities. “Our best guess at the moment is the TAM [total addressable market] we can sell into… what we have is probably $40bn-plus, but you see that every single day, there are new announcements of hundreds of billions of dollars going into this ecosystem,” gushed Malady. “We have a lot of assets that can play right into this. And frankly, we have well over $1bn-plus in funnel right now, and that's really only with our services that we have today.” Google and Meta, noted Malady, have already purchased capacity on Verizon’s network with the intent of using it for their AI workloads. “We are working closely with industry players like Nvidia to reimagine how telco functions can work along with AI workloads. We are starting this development at the far edge in a private network,” he continued. AI inferencing at the edge Looking to the future, Verizon has high hopes that demand will soar for AI inferencing at the network edge, which holds out the promise of reduced latency, real-time decision-making and bandwidth optimisation, and marks a seismic shift away from the current AI focus on training large language modules in large datacentre facilities. Verizon cites consultancy McKinsey, which reckons 60% to 70% of AI workloads are expected to migrate to real-time inference by 2030, “creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.” Malady noted: “As AI shifts from training to deep deployment, the need for distributed computing will become increasingly important for real-time decisions and predictions.” Warming to his edge AI compute theme, he added: “We have thousands of distributed telco facilities, many of which already have power, space and cooling available for this compute at the edge. As we take stock of our existing assets, Verizon’s ability to be a foundational player in the AI ecosystem is clear. The technical infrastructure required to enable AI is evolving.” Malady flagged, too, that Verizon has between 100 and 200 acres of undeveloped land, “some currently zoned for datacentre build, and much of it in prime datacentre-friendly areas”. Through a new strategic partnership with Vultr, a GPU-as-a-service (GPUaaS) provider, Verizon will initially deploy GPUaaS infrastructure in one of its datacentres and tap into its high-capacity fibre network for distribution. “We anticipate helping to broaden their reach and enable our mutual customers with AI training and inference capabilities at the edge over time,” stated Verizon. Earlier this month, SK Telecom, arguably the world’s most advanced telco when it comes to AI adoption, launched a GPUaaS offering targeted at enterprise and government customers in South Korea from its AI datacentre in Gasan, on the outskirts of Seoul. Expect to see further announcements from telcos around the world this year about new revenue-generating opportunities linked to the AI boom. - Ken Wieland, Contributing Editor, TelecomTV Jan 29, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 24, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. DeepSeek, the latest alternative to ChatGPT and other AI assistants, recently released a new version that’s causing chaos and confusion across the AI landscape. With reports about DeepSeek’s outstanding performance and power efficiency emerging, established entities like OpenAI and Meta are getting quite nervous. None more nervous than Nvidia, though, whose market cap plummeted in response to the hype over DeepSeek. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia lost a record $569 billion at the start of the week. Companies like Siemens Energy and Oracle also saw their stock prices fall. DeepSeek is an AI tool that’s currently available free of charge on the web. You can check it out yourself at chat.deepseek.com, although registration is temporarily on hold due to the recent surge in interest. Not only was DeepSeek developed by a Chinese startup in just a few months, it apparently uses significantly fewer resources. Although it’s reminiscent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it’s based on its own large language model called — you guessed it — “DeepSeek,” now version 3. According to some initial impressions, DeepSeek outperforms the competition for many features, including the generation of textual answers and the prompt-based creation of images. The latter is possible with an additional app called Janus Pro. DeepSeek delivers results quickly, and those results are both detailed and coherent. DeepSeek is currently so popular that it’s the most downloaded app in Apple’s App Store (ahead of ChatGPT) and the highest app in the “Top Free Apps” category in the Google Play Store (ahead of ChatGPT, Threads, and Google Gemini). This puts enormous pressure on OpenAI and the rest, who now see their positions jeopardized. Shortly after the publicized success of DeepSeek, the new AI chatbot faced a bitter setback. There’s apparently been a “large-scale cyber attack” on the company, reports BleepingComputer. As a result, new user registrations are not being accepted at this time. However, anyone who already has access to DeepSeek can continue to use it. It’s currently unknown who carried out the attack on DeepSeek, but it’s likely to be a targeted DDoS attack, perhaps perpetrated by an entity who feels threatened by DeepSeek’s sudden catching of attention. We don’t know when DeepSeek user registrations will open again.

Title: “DEEP-CRASH!”

Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:05:49Z

By Greg Guenthner Posted January 28, 2025 The opening salvo of a hot artificial intelligence battle just dumped a bucket of cold water on the stock market. Big Tech spiraled lower to kick off the trading week after a Chinese AI firm called DeepSeek made huge waves in the industry. The ten-second version of this story is DeepSeek can do everything the other major AI firms can do, and more — all for a fraction of the cost, time, and equipment. As far as I can tell, there’s still plenty of arguing about the details of just how powerful this thing is by folks a lot smarter and more tech-savvy than me. The first rumblings of DeepSeek’s amazing achievements hit the market Friday, causing scattered selling in chip king Nvidia Corp. (NVDA). Shares ended the day down more than 3%. Not a great day — but also not the end of the world, as NVDA was able to post its second straight week of gains. But tech investors became noticeably nervous Sunday evening. By Monday morning, the DeepDeek fiasco sparked a mini-panic that ripped through the semiconductors and tech at large. The Nasdaq Composite gapped down nearly 3.5% to kick off the new trading week, while NVDA steadily dropped all morning, losing 17% by the closing bell. NVDA isn’t the only casualty of the DeepSeek crash. Speculators dumped their Big Tech shares, Bitcoin, and anything even remotely associated with the AI boom. The financial media wasted no time playing up the ugly numbers. Bloomberg was one of the first to note that the NVDA rout was the biggest in market history. “Nvidia shares tumbled as much as 18% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020,” Bloomberg reports. “In early afternoon trading in New York, the decline erased $560 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history.” What Bloomberg failed to note in its headline (and what is obvious from the above graph) is that due to its sheer size, NVDA’s notable drops during its incredible two-year rally make up 80% of the biggest single-day market-cap losses in history. The lesson: big numbers are big! Plus, these huge drops didn’t stop the stock from rallying more than 1,200% off its 2022 bear market lows. In case those gains fail to impress you, please note that yesterday’s drop shoved NVDA below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. I know it’s all too easy to get sucked into the bearish narrative after watching yesterday’s action unfold. But instead of focusing on the hundreds of billions in market cap that disappeared, I’m far more interested in what the rest of the market has to say in reaction to the NVDA situation. We’ve already witnessed the premarket panic, NVDA dropping double-digits, and other big tech names falling in sympathy. And while most market-watchers are hung up on hoping and praying NVDA catches a bid off these panic lows, we can use the confusion to our advantage. For starters, I’m keeping an eye on tech names that have little involvement in the AI ecosystem. While the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by more than 3% on Monday, more than 1,600 components finished the day in positive territory. Of these stocks, 150 gained more than 5%. Sharp declines in NVDA, ORCL, AVGO, MSFT, GOOG, and TSLA masked many of the positives happening under the surface. Then there are stocks outside of the tech sphere (Yes, they exist!)… Perhaps you’ve heard of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Big Board had a big day Monday. While everyone was sweating NVDA, the Dow posted a modest gain of 0.65%. But here’s the kicker: Every single stock in the Dow finished the day in the green. This looks more like a rotation than a selloff. While investors are ditching NVDA, they’re clearly putting money work elsewhere. Consumer staples, discretionary, and financials all managed to post gains yesterday. Finally, is the DeepSeek revelation a catalyst for a major trend reversal in China? The iShares China Large-cap ETF (FXI) posted a gain of almost 1% on Monday while the American tech sector faltered. At this point, we don’t know how much of the DeepSeek news is hype, panic, or somewhere in between. But investors are reacting favorably to Chinese names. Remember, these stocks have been a sloppy mess for years. They stopped going down as of early last year and have been trying to produce a steady uptrend ever since. We’ll see if this news is a game changer and leads to a bigger move higher in FXI. NVDA is not the stock market – no matter how much the financial media insists otherwise. Judging by Monday’s action, we’ll have little trouble finding viable trade ideas outside of the AI trainwreck. We might even get a reprieve from AI insanity thanks to a slew of tech earnings hitting later this week. TSLA, META, MSFT, IBM, and NOW report on Wednesday afternoon. AAPL and INTC follow on Thursday afternoon. If these aren’t enough distractions for you, we also have a Fed meeting and rate decision on Wednesday, GDP Thursday, and this morning’s durable orders to dissect. The market tends to have a short memory during busy trading periods. With a full slate scheduled this week, the NVDA strife could fall off the front page faster than you could imagine…

[+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) suffered a 9% stock drop on Monday, January 27, amid concerns sparked by DeepSeek’s affordable AI chatbot. This emerging technology has disrupted the industry, posing a significant threat to U.S. tech leaders and raising questions about the long-term viability of AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia’s stock(NASDAQ: NVDA) also felt the ripple effect, and plummeted 17% on the same day. See Why Is DeepSeek Sinking Nvidia Stock? Chinese AI DeepSeek has open-sourced its R1 model, which has been shown to outperform leading models from OpenAI and Meta in various benchmarks. What’s more, this breakthrough technology is not only freely available but also offers a cost-efficient solution that requires fewer computing resources, making it an attractive proposition for the industry. The situation could have particular significance for Dell’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI servers. Dell’s revenue streams are diversified, with roughly half derived from personal computers (PCs) sales and related products, while the remaining half comes from its robust infrastructure business, including servers, where the company holds a dominant market position. While Dell’s Q3 sales grew 10% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $24.4 billion, the company’s client solutions group experienced a 1% y-o-y decline in revenue to $12.1 billion. Consumer sales within this segment plummeted 18% y-o-y. However, Dell’s infrastructure business emerged as a bright spot, growing 34% y-o-y to $11.4 billion - with server and networking revenue surging 58% y-o-y to $7.4 billion. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Dell’s investment in AI servers is poised to drive substantial growth in its infrastructure business, as the AI server market is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2029. While AI-powered servers are typically low-margin, the sheer scale of the market presents a compelling growth opportunity. This growth will likely be complemented by increasing revenue from AI-optimized PC sales on the consumer side. While Dell’s revenues may be held back somewhat by the struggling PC segment, a substantial PC upgrade cycle is anticipated in 2025. The current economic climate and rising inflation have led to delayed tech upgrades. However, the availability of AI-enabled PCs, combined with the impending end of Windows 10 support in October 2025, may prompt consumers to upgrade their machines to leverage next-generation technologies and ensure ongoing security updates. With AI empowering both legitimate users and hackers, the need for enhanced protection may further incentivize upgrades. Dell’s stock valuation remains relatively modest, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, suggesting that the shares may still be undervalued. However, with the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned that the sales growth may be slower than anticipated. DELL stock has seen a 38% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -27% in 2022, 96% in 2023, and 53% in 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In conclusion, Dell’s attractive valuation, robust server and networking sales, and the impending PC refresh cycle position the company for potential outperformance, making it a compelling AI stock pick for 2025 and beyond. However, investors should exercise caution, as Dell’s business remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting industry trends.

Title: The World's Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierpaz/2025/01/28/the-worlds-most-trustworthy-crypto-exchanges/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:00:15Z
Full Content:
Christmas came early for bitcoin this year. On the back of record-breaking launches of ETFs backed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, which have accumulated $112 billion in bitcoin, and president Donald Trump’s reelection in November, the digital asset crossed $100,000. Enthusiasts are expecting 2025 to be more bullish as a pro-crypto congress is coming in power with promises to finally pass regulation that will move the industry out of the proverbial penalty box. Hype cycles like this create unbridled optimism, and a healthy dose of FOMO, but investors should proceed with caution. And this does not mean which tokens one chooses to speculate in. There are hundreds of crypto exchanges in the world - essentially retail brokerage firms - with fancy websites, attractive features, and yield propositions and promises to keep your money safe. But all crypto exchanges and marketplaces are not created equal. There are significant differences between the types and number of licenses they hold and how they safeguard your digital assets. Anyone who was burned by the collapse of FTX in 2022 knows how important that can be. Additionally, not every exchange provides the same trading opportunities or charges the same amount. The top firm on Forbes’ third annual Best Crypto Exchange ranking, which analyzed more than 200 firms, is $85 billion Chicago-based CME Group. While this giant futures exchange, founded in 1898 to trade butter and eggs, is not suitable for most retail investors, we gave it high scores because in the wild and wooly world of crypto, safety is paramount and the CME Group is highly regulated by the CFTC. While crypto is still a tiny part of what is traded at CME, during 2024 it traded $1.4 trillion in futures contracts for digital assets such as bitcoin or ether. CME Group offers such things as Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures and options, with minimums of $300 for the smallest of futures contracts, that customers can gain access to via traditional brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and Fidelity. When it comes to retail oriented exchanges $70 billion (market cap) Coinbase earned the #2 spot in the rankings. Coinbase is the only major publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. and its customers pay more for this perceived safety in fees and transaction costs. Thanks to some 8 million active accounts, it is the largest custodian of bitcoin in the world, holding 2.4 million worth a staggering $245 billion at current price levels. Asset safety is the most important feature exchange customers demand according to our survey of retail crypto trade. UK-based Bitstamp, a global exchange with a significant presence in Europe, came in third, with Binance (the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume) coming in fourth and Menlo Park-headquartered Robinhood, which is predominantly oriented toward stocks and options, taking fifth place. Robinhood, long criticized for gamifying investing to attract a youthful audience, has become something of a meme headquarters holding $15 billion worth of DOGE coin for clients (Shiba Inu inspired token) and added “dogwifhat” to a list that includes Shiba Inu, PEPE, and BONK. Besides meme coins, Robinhood acquired Luxembourg-based cryptoexchange Bitstamp last July for approximately $200 million, with the firms continuing to operate separately pending the necessary board approvals in the coming months. This acquisition may be the start of a consolidation trend for this highly fragmented industry as the most successful firms attempt to break out from their regional focus. Binance, absent during last year’s rankings due to legal wranglings, continues to be a dominant firm. It claims to have 245 million registered users and its average daily spot trading volume of around $14 billion represents almost a quarter of the $62 billion. The next biggest exchange, Dubai-based Bybit, only has $8.2 billion. Coinbase has an average daily crypto trading volume of $5.3 billion. Binance’s new management team promises to focus more on compliance, which would be a boon for the crypto compliance sector. The remaining firms in the ranking include some of the most prominent worldwide. In the U.S., leading firms include Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com, and Fidelity. In South Korea, the two major firms are Upbit and Bithumb, while in Japan, they are Bitbank, bitFlyer, and Coincheck, and in Europe, we recognize Revolut, bitpanda, and Bitvavo. Together, these firms hold an estimated $1.2 trillion in client assets, and, according to the web analytics firm Similarweb, their websites were frequented by a combined 438 million users in November. Below, please find the 2025 rankings. Many investors prioritize low fees when deciding where to trade crypto. Most exchanges post their prices for sellers or purchasers online, respectively known as “maker” and “taker” fees; but they do not tell the whole story. Traders also need to be aware of a term called spread, which is the difference between a quoted buying and selling prices in an orderbook. The size of the spread varies by exchange and trading pair, but a general rule of thumb is that platforms with high volume have lower spreads. And vice versa. Our research revealed that the weighted cost of execution in the crypto market among ranked firms today, and inclusive of spread, is 80 basis points. To do this analysis we used the cost of trading reported by crypto providers to us or via their website, plus average spread information from CoinGecko. The specific test looked at what it would cost to purchase $25,000 of crypto without any volume discounts or other promotions. While trading fees can be relatively easily controlled, spread is a function of a provider’s overall liquidity. Among ranked firms, the average spread was 64 basis points (bp), with Upbit, Coincheck, and Bitstamp averaging 241bp, 181bp, and 143bp, respectively, as the costliest firms.[ One hundred basis points is the equivalent of one percentage point.] Coinbase’s 19bp spread was among the lowest and slightly bested Binance’s 21bp. There is a lot of variance among firm, if a trader wants to know the cheapest place to buy or sell crypto, it is important to evanluate both the posted fees and spread together. Source: Forbes, CoinGecko, company websites The chart above shows both fees and spreads and demonstrates that the biggest exchanges by market share tend to have the lowest trading cost, with the exception of Coinbase. Robinhood, which caters to retail traders, has a zero-fee trading model but the numbers above fail to incorporate the spreads,which in Robinhood’s case are a core part of their business model since they sell order flow. U.S. exchanges with more than a decade of crypto service such as Coinbase and Kraken continue to enjoy high demand despite higher trading costs. Eventually fee compression from competition from firms like Robinhood could drive fees down. There are several firms that have both expensive and cheap alternatives for heavy users, and Coinbase and Revolut are perfect examples. Coinbase retail clients averaged fees of 126 basis points. But in an effort to retain low-volume but high fee-paying clients the company created a monthly subscription service called Coinbase One that would eliminate fees. Prices range between $30-$300/month depending on volume. A majority of Revolut clients trade using their traditional app and pay 249bp on average, but the firm launched a web platform called Revolut X in select countries late last year that is priced at 10 basis points per trade and is gaining heavy traction. By Forbes measurement, there were no less than half a billion crypto users globally at the end of 2024. We enlisted the help of web analytics firm SimilarWeb, to help us determine where the most crypto traders were. The map below gives an estimation of the geographic dispersion of crypto investors. Forbes with similarweb data The largest concentration of traders is in the Asia-Pacific region, which has 160 million visitors. Europe was next with 134 million. The US and Canada added another 56 million. Latin America and the Caribbean had 40 million traders, and Africa was the lowest at 18 million. Traffic to crypto providers is highly concentrated, with 12 ranked firms and 3 unranked firms each having 10+ million unique visitors. Firms like Binance, Crypto.com, and Bitget prominently display the number of “users” on their website in the tens or hundreds of millions, without defining the term. These firms, along with many others surveyed for this study, did not provide up to date figures on active accounts. However, monthly SimilarWeb data provides a clearer picture and approximate number of users that is consistent across all exchanges. This analysis reveals that Binance, for example, had 75 million unique users (17% of the total) compared to Coinbase’s 56 million (13%). Robinhood was fourth at 37 million. But aside from these major global exchanges, there are some providers that focus on just one or two domiciles. The 49 million traders in South Korea are primarily serviced by two major institutions, Bithumb and Upbit, who received a combined total of 70% of all crypto exchange visitors. Much of the remainder went to larger offshore exchanges like Binance, ByBit, and Bitget. While these exchanges are ranked, none are actually licensed to operate in South Korea. The top three firms servicing Japan's 16 million visitors are Bitflyer, Coincheck, and Bitbank, while Germany’s 15 million go to Austria-based Bitpanda along with Bitget, and Binance. In India, Binance is the biggest exchange, accounting for essentially all of the of the country’s 6 million monthly visitors. The biggest local exchange operating in the south-Asian country is CoinDCX, which received 1.1 million visitors. Turning to Latin America, Brazil’s 14 million visitors primarily went to Binance, Singapore-based Gate.io (which has a sponsorship deal with soccer star Lionel Messi), and Coinbase. Finally, because Russia continues to be under US sanctions, American exchanges like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken do not have a presence in those countries. Given its 18 million monthly users, Russia remains a major crypto trading hub. The biggest destinations are ByBit (6.7 million), HTX (3.5 million), and Binance (2.4 million). Ed Note: This article has been updated to clarify certain facts about Fidelity Crypto, including that it considers itself to be a marketplace rather than an exchange.

Title: Buy These High Yield CEF Dividends To Hedge Against Market Volatility

investment analysis inflation economic chart With the new administration now in full swing, market events are coming our way at a furious pace, especially for our high yield CEFs. One thing that’s clear about the next few years? Volatility is likely to tick up, especially with stock valuations stretched. Now more than ever, we need to be diversified, so we’re set up to offset any shocks to any one sector while we collect our high closed-end fund dividends. So that’s what we’re going to do today. And CEFs are the best tool to do it. Through just three funds (see tickers below), we’ll give ourselves access to some of the top blue-chip stocks, real estate investment trusts and high-yield bonds out there. Better still (for safety, as well as income), we’ll get a big slice of our return as dividends, as these three funds pay an 8.8% average yield between them. That’s about seven times what the average S&P 500 stock pays. Plus, these yields are sustainable. To say that this “dividend difference” is a big deal is an understatement. Consider a million-dollar portfolio put into the S&P 500 versus these three funds. That’d get you about $1,008 per month with the index, which no one can live on anymore. But that same amount in this three-fund portfolio gets you $7,333 per month — more than the average monthly paycheck in America. Let’s see how these funds’ high-quality assets help sustain those payouts. Their bargain valuations help out a bit on the dividend front, too. A great place to start is with the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX). I say that because this CEF should appeal to anyone who currently holds an S&P 500 index fund, since its mandate is to buy all of the stocks in that index. That means you’ll get names like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), Bank of America (BAC) and other well-known reliable performers that form the backbone of the economy. They’ve helped SPXX deliver strong long-term gains. At the same time, SPXX yields 7.5%, while S&P 500 index funds yield just around 1.2%. That higher yield comes from two major sources. The first is SPXX’s covered-call-option strategy, in which it sells contracts to investors who pay for the privilege of buying the fund’s stocks at a future date at a predetermined amount. SPXX then hands the cash it receives for selling these option contracts to investors as dividends. Second, SPXX will occasionally sell certain holdings and hand the profits to investors, again in the form of dividends. That means you don’t have to worry about buying or selling your shares to rebalance your position. Just let the income flow your way as the managers do all the work. There’s a third reason why that yield is so big, and that’s one of the really cool things about SPXX and CEFs like it. SPXX trades at a 5.8% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) as I write this, so we’re getting a bargain that ETF buyers simply don’t have access to. This also means that management can pay out that 7.5% dividend, based on the market price of SPXX, while earning just 7.1% from its NAV, or portfolio value. Remember that the S&P 500 has returned 10% per year on average, so that 7.1% profit per year should be easy for SPXX to achieve. The Cohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund (RQI) is a real estate focused CEF that I talk about a lot, for a simple reason: Its management has a proven track record of picking the best REITs. Cohen & Steers has 39 years of experience managing real estate assets for clients and manages over $100 billion in assets. RQI’s yield is also 7.5%, which is pretty easy for the fund to deliver, since management’s annualized returns since RQI’s 2002 inception has been 9.1%. RQI trades around the par value of its portfolio now, but there’s a good reason why. Returns from the fund’s portfolio nicely cover its dividend. It also holds REITs from various industries and regions, so we can look at it as a kind of “one-stop shop” for REIT investing. (RQI also holds a small lot of high-yielding preferred shares.) If that weren’t enough, RQI invests in over 200 real estate assets, most of which are stocks in REITs that themselves manage hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of individual properties. Top holdings include cell-tower REIT American Tower (AMT), warehouse giant Prologis (PLD) and data-center landlord Equinix (EQIX). That’s unparalleled diversification, with a leaning toward some of the most in-demand real estate in the US. That gives us extra reassurance as we collect RQI’s 7.5% payout. Now let’s boost the income stream on this “mini-portfolio” with the PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS), whose 11.4% income stream is enormous, but also sustainable. And there’s a simple reason why. High Yield Bond Yields Above we see the average yield for high-yield corporate bonds, which has hovered around 7% since early 2022. Note that Fed rate cuts have pushed that average lower over the last year and a half. This matters for PAXS, a buy recommendation of my CEF Insider service, because the fund invests in bonds similar to those in this index, or “bond-like” assets that are fairly comparable. It has also been collecting that income, which it has been handing over to investors as cash dividends. Since the average effective maturity for the bonds in PAXS’s portfolio is now 6.3 years, that means it’s effectively secured bonds at these high yields to fund payments to investors for many years to come. But you might be thinking, that’s 7%, which is far below the 11.4% PAXS pays out. While that’s true, remember that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates over those six years, which will boost the value of PAXS’ bonds (since they pay out more than newly issued bonds would). As that happens, PAXS can sell those bonds at a profit and hand that over to investors as dividends. Now this fund does trade at a slight premium (3.4%) to NAV, but that’s actually a bargain for a fund from PIMCO, which is a revered name among CEF investors. PIMCO funds often trade at premiums—and those premiums regularly stretch into double digits. These three funds together get us an 8.8%-yielding portfolio with a nice mix of stocks, bonds and REITs. And since you can buy all three of these CEFs through any stock brokerage (CEFs are bought and sold like stocks over exchanges like the NYSE), this is an easy way to diversify across hundreds of assets all at once.

RQI’s yield is also 7.5%, which is pretty easy for the fund to deliver, since management’s annualized returns since RQI’s 2002 inception has been 9.1%. RQI trades around the par value of its portfolio now, but there’s a good reason why. Returns from the fund’s portfolio nicely cover its dividend. It also holds REITs from various industries and regions, so we can look at it as a kind of “one-stop shop” for REIT investing. (RQI also holds a small lot of high-yielding preferred shares.) If that weren’t enough, RQI invests in over 200 real estate assets, most of which are stocks in REITs that themselves manage hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of individual properties. Top holdings include cell-tower REIT American Tower (AMT), warehouse giant Prologis (PLD) and data-center landlord Equinix (EQIX). That’s unparalleled diversification, with a leaning toward some of the most in-demand real estate in the US. That gives us extra reassurance as we collect RQI’s 7.5% payout. Now let’s boost the income stream on this “mini-portfolio” with the PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS), whose 11.4% income stream is enormous, but also sustainable. And there’s a simple reason why. High Yield Bond Yields Above we see the average yield for high-yield corporate bonds, which has hovered around 7% since early 2022. Note that Fed rate cuts have pushed that average lower over the last year and a half. This matters for PAXS, a buy recommendation of my CEF Insider service, because the fund invests in bonds similar to those in this index, or “bond-like” assets that are fairly comparable. It has also been collecting that income, which it has been handing over to investors as cash dividends. Since the average effective maturity for the bonds in PAXS’s portfolio is now 6.3 years, that means it’s effectively secured bonds at these high yields to fund payments to investors for many years to come. But you might be thinking, that’s 7%, which is far below the 11.4% PAXS pays out. While that’s true, remember that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates over those six years, which will boost the value of PAXS’ bonds (since they pay out more than newly issued bonds would). As that happens, PAXS can sell those bonds at a profit and hand that over to investors as dividends. Now this fund does trade at a slight premium (3.4%) to NAV, but that’s actually a bargain for a fund from PIMCO, which is a revered name among CEF investors. PIMCO funds often trade at premiums—and those premiums regularly stretch into double digits. These three funds together get us an 8.8%-yielding portfolio with a nice mix of stocks, bonds and REITs. And since you can buy all three of these CEFs through any stock brokerage (CEFs are bought and sold like stocks over exchanges like the NYSE), this is an easy way to diversify across hundreds of assets all at once.

Title: UK Circling the Drain – Crisis what Crisis?

Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:00:00Z

EditorEconomy Kit Knightly, OffGuardian It is now almost five years since the start of the COVID event. The public was told there was a deadly disease that would affect the entire population, and everyone was at risk. However, in order to truly understand COVID, that event must be situated within a framework that examines the underlying economic determinants. In fact, many on the “left” are notable for having failed to undertake such an analysis and merely capitulated to the mainstream narrative. The COVID event had little if anything to do with public health. It was a policy mechanism deployed to manage an impending financial crisis. COVID policies served as a pretext for halting economic activity in a controlled manner to address systemic contradictions within neoliberal capitalism. Unprecedented fiscal and monetary interventions were strategic tools to stabilise the economy and prevent a deeper collapse of financial markets. The lockdowns, framed as public health necessities, effectively suspended economic activity in ways that allowed capital to regroup and restructure. This included consolidating corporate power (e.g. through increased reliance on digital platforms), and creating conditions for new rounds of capital investment post-crisis, facilitated by a convenient debt crisis and World Bank loans with pro-neoliberal strings-attached conditionalities. The framing of COVID-19 as a health crisis obscured its role in facilitating economic restructuring under the guise of emergency management. It also helped promote the notion of a benign, well-intentioned state that really cares about the well-being of the population. Neoliberalism has dominated economic thought since the late 20th century, characterised by deregulation, privatisation and a focus on market-driven solutions. This framework led to systemic failures, particularly evident in the lead-up to the COVID event. Financial markets were on the brink of collapse immediately prior to COVID. Quantitative easing (QE) had been put in overdrive following the financial crisis of 2008. QE was used as a tool to prop up a failing system. What we saw following the 2008 crash was ordinary people being pushed further to the edge. We witnessed more than a decade of ‘austerity’ in the UK, a neoliberal assault on the living conditions of ordinary people carried out under the guise of reining in public debt following the bank bail outs. During that period, a leading UN poverty expert compared the Conservative government’s welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and warned that, unless austerity is ended, the UK’s poorest people face lives that are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”. Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, accused ministers of being in a state of denial about the impact of policies. He accused them of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population”. In a 2019 report, the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank laid the blame for more than 130,000 deaths in the UK since 2012 at the door of government policies. It claimed that these deaths could have been prevented if improvements in public health policy had not stalled as a direct result of austerity cuts. And in a report on poverty in the UK by Professor David Gordon of the University of Bristol, it was found that almost 18 million could not afford adequate housing conditions, 12 million were too poor to engage in common social activities, one in three could not afford to heat their homes adequately in winter and four million children and adults were not properly fed (Britain’s population is estimated at around 66 million). Meanwhile, The Equality Trust in 2018 reported that the ‘austerity years’ were just fine for the richest 1,000 people in the UK. They had increased their wealth by £66 billion in one year alone (2017-2018), by £274 billion in five years (2013-2018) and had increased their total wealth to £724 billion – significantly more than the poorest 40% of households combined (£567 billion). And in early 2020, all this hardship was to be compounded by lockdowns to avert another financial meltdown. After treating millions of ordinary people as described above, we were informed that the elite now wanted to save everyone by locking them up and injecting them! Looking at Europe, investigative journalist Michael Byrant says that €1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the financial crisis in Europe alone in 2020. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. Byrant stated that all talk about big finance bankrupting the nation (again) by looting public funds, politicians destroying public services at the behest of large investors and the depredations of the casino economy was conveniently washed away with COVID. He adds that predators who saw their financial empires coming apart resolved to shut down society. To solve the problems they created, they needed a cover story, which appeared in the form of a ‘novel virus’. The European Central Bank agreed to a €1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a €750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of ‘the pandemic’ on businesses and workers. What happened in Europe was part of a strategy to avert the wider systemic collapse of the financial system. And what we have seen since COVID is a massive increase in global debt, inflation and more ‘austerity’ imposed on ordinary people. Since 2020, in the UK, poverty has increased in two-thirds of communities, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions of people and living standards are plummeting. The poorest families have been enduring a ‘frightening’ collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. Lockdowns were not imposed for public health reasons; they were implemented to prevent hyperinflation and manage a crisis of capitalism. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University argues that by suspending economic activity via lockdowns, governments aimed to mitigate inflationary pressures resulting from excessive liquidity injected into the economy through QE. The lockdowns also facilitated a restructuring of the economy, allowing larger corporations to absorb smaller businesses struggling to survive during this period. Prior to 2020, government reliance on financial markets and monetary policy tools like QE did not address underlying social and economic issues but instead perpetuated the system and existing inequalities. Policies rolled out as part of the COVID event reflected a continuation of neoliberal principles, with governments opting for temporary fixes rather than comprehensive reforms that prioritise public welfare. The extraordinary monetary policies (lockdowns) served to maintain financial stability at the expense of broader societal needs. In the run up to COVID, QE created an illusion of stability within financial markets, allowing governments to avoid confronting deeper structural issues. This policy led to asset bubbles and increased volatility, creating a precarious situation where any attempt to tighten monetary policy could trigger significant market disruptions. So, has anyone challenged this analysis of locating COVID policies within a framework that emphasises underlying economic determinants? In mainstream discourse, it has been ignored. That’s not too surprising because it would put the final nail in the coffin of the dominant COVID narrative. While the Ukraine war and supply chain disruptions are often cited as primary inflation drivers once COVID-related restrictions were lifted, some economists predicted that once lockdowns had ended, inflation could surge dramatically. As Deutsche Bank noted, after 30 years of low inflation, this “benign era could end abruptly once lockdowns are lifted”. Deutsche Bank also stated that the biggest financial bailout in history took place during the COVID era. Meanwhile, most economists would probably dismiss out of hand the arguments stated above rather than engage with them critically. Challenging the prevailing economic orthodoxy never goes down well. Highlighting systemic failures associated with neoliberal frameworks and questioning the efficacy of measures like QE in addressing underlying issues requires open dialogue rather than heavy handed pushback. During COVID, the UK government implemented several financial measures to support workers and businesses, with a significant focus on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), commonly known as the furlough scheme. The CJRS cost the UK government approximately £70 billion. This scheme enabled employers to claim grants covering up to 80% of employees’ wages, with a cap of £2,500 per month per employee. To finance this unprecedented level of support, the UK government increased its borrowing significantly. This borrowing was necessary to cover not only the furlough scheme but also other COVID policy measures. The increase in borrowing led to a substantial rise in public debt, which was exacerbated by the economic downturn caused by lockdowns and restrictions. Much of this debt was financed through mechanisms such as QE by the Bank of England, which involved purchasing government bonds. In the fiscal year 2019/20, prior to the COVID event, the UK government borrowed approximately £62.3 billion. This figure represented about 2.8% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at that time. In stark contrast, during the fiscal year 2020/21, government borrowing surged to around £303 billion. This significant increase in borrowing reflects the unprecedented financial measures taken by the UK government. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, recently highlighted a £22 billion “gap” in public finances attributed to the previous administration. Keir Starmer is warning of unprecedented economic challenges — promises of ongoing economic woe (for ordinary people) that echo what economist Huw Pill said a couple of years ago — that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. Of course, COVID lockdowns and restrictions were all about ‘saving granny’. And if you challenged the narrative or did not comply, you were beyond the moral pale. Those who recognise the manipulation of public sentiment by those who control the global economy might be forgiven for viewing the ‘saving granny’ narrative as the height of cynicism, coming from individuals who have demonstrated a lack of moral standards for decades with their wars, destructive economic policies and complete disregard for ordinary working people. And although people like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates were often singled out for criticism by those who challenged the mainstream narrative on COVID, when referring to the ‘controllers of the global economy’, this means those who largely remain in the shadows, the powerful and unscrupulous banking families and their handmaidens discussed by Dean Henderson in a detailed five-part series of articles back in 2011. Meanwhile, in the UK, there continues to be money available (to date almost £13 billion) to send to Ukraine to ensure the killing and dying continues in order to guarantee that those bastions of morality — BlackRock, J P Morgan and all — get their slice of the post-war honey pot.

Title: How DeepSeek’s AI Model Impacts AVGO Stock?

CANADA - 2025/01/06: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, saw its stock plunge over 17% on Monday, January 27. This can be attributed to the ripples DeepSeek created, sending tremors through the Silicon Valley. DeepSeek’s more efficient approach challenges the conventional wisdom that bigger and more expensive necessarily means better in AI development. The Chinese AI lab DeepSeek recently made waves by releasing their DeepSeek-R1 model as open-source software. What makes this noteworthy is that according to the lab’s research, DeepSeek-R1 achieves better performance than prominent models like OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama across various metrics. The model stands out not just for its performance, but also because it’s freely available, cost-efficient, and demands less computing resources than competitors. This development has caused concerns in the west, where major tech companies have typically focused on a resource-intensive approach — accumulating massive amounts of computing infrastructure. The situation could have particular significance for Broadcom’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI networking technology. But also see DeepSeek Could Boost Intel Stock. Broadcom’s revenue of 51.6 billion in fiscal 2024 (fiscal ends in October) was up a stellar 44% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion in late 2023. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. Broadcom’s business relies heavily on their networking products, which are crucial for data transfer in AI systems. If the market for premium AI chips experiences a downturn, amid the rise of DeepSeek, it could create a domino effect, potentially hurting sales of Broadcom’s supporting technologies and components. Investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple for AVGO stock, taking into account the expected AI contribution. With the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned about the sales growth may be slower than earlier anticipated. AVGO stock has seen a solid 84% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 110% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, with changes in the White House, and the DeepSeek update, could AVGO see a strong jump? We think that investors should tread with caution. This potential shift in the industry toward efficiency over raw power, combined with a broader slowdown, could create additional challenges for Broadcom’s business prospects. While AVGO stock took a plunge amid the rise of DeepSeek, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 3% this morning after plunging nearly 17% yesterday. The rebound came after JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on NVDA today. Why JPMorgan Remains Bullish on NVDA Noting that Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that it had trained an AI model for a very low price of about $5.6 million, JPMorgan asserted that this news is actually positive for chip makers. Specifically, according to the bank, when computing products become less costly to manufacture historically, the demand for chips and the consumption of more expensive chips have increased. The latter trend should play out going forward in the AI chip market, JPMorgan asserted. Further, the bank wrote that some information about DeepSeek's model has not been provided. For example, the total cost of all training sessions may not have been included in the $5.6 million total, and the degree to which the start-up used existing open-source models was not disclosed, JPMorgan stated. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” the bank wrote. The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock In the last month heading into today, the shares had dropped 12%, while they had pulled back 16% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The ranks of the heavyweights of the artificial intelligence world were shaken up seemingly overnight with news of an AI program made by a small Chinese start-up that can seemingly rival the best that OpenAI and other major AI leaders can provide.Enter DeepSeek, the company that is set to change the game for AI and threaten the unrivaled dominance US-based tech companies have had thus far.The fact that this is disruptive should come as no surprise. Just a week ago, most of the attention in the AI field was focused on the advancements of OpenAI, Meta, and more. Talk of AI super-agents, which are programs that can handle complex tasks and make decisions with a level of intelligence that could theoretically rival some of humanity's best and brightest, and the reveal of OpenAI's new Operator agent all seemed to point to continued American dominance in the sector. AI super-agents were poised to disrupt the labor market, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg having said that within 2025, it was possible that AI will become advanced enough that it could do the work of a mid-level software engineer.But the revelation of DeepSeek has seemingly blindsided the entire industry and sent quakes shaking through Wall Street. In just a week after being launched, it became the most downloaded free app in the US, the BBC reported.But what is DeepSeek? What makes it different from other AI companies? And more importantly, why is this making such major waves in the tech world?Here is everything you need to know.DeepSeek is a Chinese start-up established in 2023, owned by the hedge fund High-Flyer. The company released its first models for free in November of the same year, with continued and further refined models put out in 2024.On January 10, 2025, it released its first AI chatbot to the public.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now But what makes it so impressive is how it was able to be made at a fraction of the cost that larger US firms pay for the same results, as well as with a fraction of the high-end chips that its competitors use. According to The New York Times, DeepSeek only needed around 2,000 computer chips to train its AI model, specifically chips from Nvidia, whereas other companies use around 16,000 chips. This ended up costing around $6 million. For context, Meta spent around 10 times as much to develop its own AI.Already back in May 2024, DeepSeek made waves in China for its success at making a successful AI model at such a low price, which forced the country's preeminent leaders in the industry such as ByteDance and Baidu to slash their own AI model prices just to stay competitive.Now, it is making a similarly major impact on the US market, with Nvidia, one of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world and a major leader in chip production, having lost nearly $600 billion in market value, the BBC reported. According to Reuters, Nvidia's stock tumble is the biggest single-session loss for any company.But what is especially significant is not only that a Chinese company made such major strides in AI development at a fraction of the cost compared to major US firms, but that it did so despite major US sanctions designed to curb China's AI advancements.How did China's DeepSeek develop despite US sanctions?The US had previously placed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China in an effort to maintain American AI dominance compared to its chief economic rival.As a result, it was far more difficult for Chinese firms to get access to the necessary chips.However, as some experts noted, that seemed to only spur innovation as developers had to find ways of getting around these restrictions.This was, in part, helped by DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng, who stockpiled a few thousand advanced Nvidia AI chips before US sanctions went into place.However, just as important is the role of innovation in getting around the limited hardware Chinese companies have at their disposal, working with what they have and making breakthroughs as a result.How is the US reacting to DeepSeek?US President Donald Trump has long been hawkish about the US trade rivalry with China and has previously stated the importance of the United States being a dominant force in AI.DeepSeek seems to upend these claims. Buddy AI (credit: PR)Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump called DeepSeek a "wake-up call" directed at US tech firms. However, he also said it was a positive development, noting that it's good for US firms, too, if a company is able to do less and spend less on AI development and still get the same result.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also noted DeepSeek's "impressive model" and referred to them as a new competitor, though also said that his company would "deliver much better models" in the future.Are the claims about DeepSeek true?While DeepSeek has been making ambitious claims, others claim that the AI's successes need to be taken with a grain of salt.One of the biggest arguments made by skeptics is that DeepSeek's AI breakthrough was only possible due to hoarding Nvidia chips or due to buying other advanced chips illegally,Speaking to CNN, Yale School of Management senior associate dean for leadership studies Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said that DeepSeek's breakthrough "is either truly disruptive or deceptive, relying on hoarded Nvidia chips and others before the export sanctions."In addition, others have voiced concern over data privacy and censorship due to policies by the Chinese government.According to multiple reports, the DeepSeek AI chatbot refused to discuss events such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the Uyghur genocide in Xinjiang and responded to questions about Taiwanese independence by saying there is no such thing as an independent Taiwan and it is a part of China.This also comes as the US is currently grappling with concerns surrounding Chinese firms having access to US citizens' data.

Full Content:
The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market Monday, initiating a massive selloff led by Nvidia, which roared back Tuesday, recovering almost half of its record-setting losses, before again struggling Wednesday. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $160 billion Wednesday morning. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Nobody Knows Anything, DeepSeek Edition

January 28, 2025 9:00am by Barry Ritholtz At the risk of repeating myself ad nauseam, this is as good a time as any to remind ourselves how little we know about the present and how completely unexpected events can be in the future. Our story so far: The technology sector has been booming for well over a decade. Software, mobile, e-tail, big data, LLM, and now AI have all been in growth mode. Expectations have been that this is the story of the next generation. Powerful semiconductors and sophisticated software will drive the demand for freestanding, energy-hungry data centers. That was upended by a scrappy China-based hedge fund that created an innovation to perform the functions of ChatGPT but with much less semiconductor horsepower needed. Free and Open Source, it created an order-of-magnitude decrease in costs.

Title: Nobody Knows Anything, Deep Think Edition

January 28, 2025 9:00am by Barry Ritholtz At the risk of repeating myself ad nauseam, this is as good a time as any to remind ourselves how little we know about the present and how completely unexpected events can be in the future. Our story so far: The technology sector has been booming for well over a decade. Software, mobile, e-tail, big data, LLM, and now AI have all been in growth mode. Expectations have been that this is the story of the next generation. Powerful semiconductors and sophisticated software will drive the demand for freestanding, energy-hungry data centers. That was upended by a scrappy China-based hedge fund that created an innovation to perform the functions of ChatGPT but with much less semiconductor horsepower needed. Free and Open Source, it created an order-of-magnitude decrease in costs. At one point yesterday markets were off 3-4%, NVIDIA was down almost 20%, and nearly a trillion dollars in market cap disappeared. As a short reminder, almost nobody had in their forecasts: 2020: Global pandemic that shut the world’s economy 2021: Inflation spikes, heads toward 9% 2022: Russia Invades Ukraine (February 24) 2023: Hamas surprise terror attack on Israel begins Gaza war (October 7) 2024: DeepSeek roils markets, challenges US advantages in AI If these surprises or random events were rarities, then perhaps we could dismiss them.

Title: Indian equities not immune to global risk-off moves: BlackRock Investment Institute

These shifts include its demographic advantage, characterised by a young and expanding workforce fuelling sustained growth; supercharged digitisation that is reshaping financial transactions; and its resilience in navigating a fragmented geopolitical landscape. These forces bolster India’s long-term growth prospects, underpinning our case for above-benchmark allocations to Indian equities in strategic portfolios with horizons of five years and more,” the institute said in a note, outlining its outlook for 2025. It argues that Indian equities are not materially expensive. MSCI India trades at about 22.5 times forward earnings, above historical averages, according to LSEG data. The perception of expensiveness often hinges on traditional valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and India’s relatively-strong growth outlook could help explain a P/E ratio above historical averages, it said. “Our preferred valuation metric — the equity risk premium (ERP) — incorporates earnings growth expectations and interest rate projections. Taking both into account, we find our estimate of India’s ERP – around 4.9 – to be broadly in line with historical average, suggesting valuations aren’t as stretched as they may appear on traditional metrics,” BlackRock said in its note. The institute expects corporate earnings to remain strong over the long run, supported by a robust growth backdrop, with policy interest rates likely settling around 5 per cent, down from the current 6.5 per cent. It sees high yields and global index inclusion driving strong demand for government bonds. “India’s inclusion in global emerging market bond indices marks a key step in addressing a longstanding challenge: Securing private capital at competitive costs,” it said. BlackRock favours consumption-related sectors, IT services, real estate and select industrials benefiting from government incentives to boost onshore manufacturing. Infrastructure will be in focus, given that the Indian government has earmarked infrastructure spending of 3.4 per cent of GDP in the fiscal ending March 2025 and has doubled such spending over the past three years. Historically, large-scale initiatives, particularly infrastructure and green projects, have relied heavily on domestic public sector funding, leading to higher borrowing costs. A second Trump administration is expected to seek increased tariffs to encourage manufacturing to return to the US and achieve other policy goals, while remaining open to negotiated deals. "We believe that multi-aligned and “connector” countries – like India – could gain from the rewiring of global supply chains and US-China competition, even with uncertainty around how US policy shapes up,” the institute observed. India stands out as one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies, with GDP growth projected to reach 6.5 per cent in 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund, well above global and emerging market averages. India’s working-age population (ages 25-64) continues to expand, in stark contrast to aging populations in many major economies. As of April 2023, United Nations data show that 65 per cent of the country’s population is under 35, with half under 25. “This demographic edge underpins India’s long-term growth prospects, setting the stage for sustained economic outperformance relative to peers such as China, Japan and the US over the next two decades, even as growth moderates from current levels,” the BlackRock note said.

Title: Nvidia stock begins recovery after DeepSeek AI frenzy prompted near $600 billion loss

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 9% Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% freefall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. That created a concern among the investment community that Nvidia’s high GPU (graphics processing unit, or AI chip) prices could come under pressure and that demand for semiconductors could wane. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday, but some names began to recover. After dropping more than 17% to start the week, Broadcom (AVGO) rose 2.6% Tuesday. Nvidia itself didn’t express much anxiety over the DeepSeek buzz, calling R1 "an excellent AI advancement" in a statement Monday. Wall Street analysts continued to reflect on the DeepSeek-fueled market rout Tuesday, expressing skepticism over DeepSeek’s reportedly low costs to train its AI models and the implications for AI stocks. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur and Citi analyst Christopher Danley said in separate notes to investors that because DeepSeek used a process called “distillation” — in other words, it relied on Meta’s (META) open-source Llama AI model to develop its model — the low spending cited by the Chinese startup (under $6 billion to train its recent V3 model) did not fully encompass its costs. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” Sur wrote. Danley added: “Given Deepseek is based on leveraging cloud service providers [Meta] and AI is still in its infancy, we lean towards the argument of continued strong growth in AI spending.” Even so, DeepSeek “clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as US hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Ondo Finance, a leading tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer, is bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), expanding the breadth of institutional-grade products onchain. 0 28 January 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through this collaboration, institutional investors will gain access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which can be instantaneously minted and redeemed 24/7 using Ripple USD (RLUSD), an enterprise-grade, USD-denominated stablecoin.Ripple and Ondo have secured commitments to seed OUSG liquidity upon initial deployment, driving further adoption of tokenized RWAs on the XRPL. This is an expansion of Ripple’s investments in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, building on its initial investment in OpenEden’s TBILL.Tokenized U.S. Treasuries like OUSG have seen exponential growth, driven by institutional demand for liquidity, efficiency, and transparency in capital markets. The tokenized asset market is set for explosive growth, with forecasts predicting it will reach $16 trillion by 2030. The XRPL is uniquely positioned to enable institutions to bring traditional financial assets onchain, offering enhanced security, verifiable trust, and new revenue-generating opportunities.By bringing OUSG to the XRPL, Ondo Finance is addressing this demand with an onchain solution that offers: Institutional-grade security: OUSG is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries managed with stringent KYC and AML compliance. Additionally, the XRPL is built with native compliance features such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and onchain credential management to enable regulatory adherence. Accessible liquidity: OUSG and RLUSD provide institutional investors with high-quality, low-risk liquidity solutions, enabling efficient portfolio management and greater accessibility to tokenized U.S. Treasuries. Scalable decentralized blockchain technology: The XRPL’s high throughput, low fees, and reliability enable seamless tokenization and trading of RWAs. “The 24/7 intraday settlement enabled by tokenized assets like OUSG marks a transformative shift in capital flow management, breaking free from traditional trading hours and slow settlements," said Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President, RippleX. "These low-risk, high-quality liquidity options not only provide better accessibility for investors but also introduce greater stability to blockchain-based markets. By addressing key barriers with Ondo Finance, this innovation supports the broader adoption of DeFi and positions the XRPL as a cornerstone for institutional-grade financial solutions.” “Ondo Finance is proud to bring OUSG, our institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, to the XRP Ledger, a blockchain that institutions already know and trust,” said Katie Wheeler, Vice President of Partnerships at Ondo Finance. “This integration is the natural convergence of a compliance-first, yield-bearing product with a network purpose-built for institutional adoption, setting the groundwork for forward-thinking institutions to lead a new era of capital markets onchain.”Ondo Finance is the first tokenized US Treasuries platform to surpass the $600m total value locked (TVL) milestone. OUSG marked a milestone as the first tokenized US Treasuries fund and offers qualified investors instant 24/7 subscriptions and redemptions, daily interest accruals, low fees, and multi-chain availability.The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is tailored to meet the requirements of traditional financial institutions, offering native features like tokenization, trading, escrow, compliance and seamless asset movement—foundational for RWA tokenization and institutional DeFi. Ripple has leveraged the XRPL for over a decade to power cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoin issuance. Leveraging its comprehensive set of features—including the first native decentralized exchange (DEX), Automated Market Maker (AMM), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Price Oracles, and forthcoming advancements like Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs), Permissioned Domains, and a Lending Protocol—the XRPL continues to expand its capabilities, solidifying its position as a trusted blockchain for institutional-grade DeFi.

It was a rough day on Monday for the Nasdaq, down 612 points or 3.1%. and for four of the Magnificent 7 stocks. China’s DeepSeek hit Nvidia especially hard, down $24.20 or 17%, but three of the Mag 7 were up for the day, Amazon, Apple and Meta. Alphabet was the only other Mag 7 stock down more than the Nasdaq’s 3.1% decline coming in at 4.2% or $8.40. Six of the seven Mag 7 companies are reporting December quarter results over the next two weeks and Nvidia reports on February 26. Since Monday’s market reaction has snuffed some of the wind out of the AI and tech stocks, it could be beneficial as it may have lowered expectations, at least for the AI oriented companies. The projections below are from Yahoo Finance! and are based on a company’s fiscal year. Meta reports on Wednesday, January 29, after the market closes. The company has the second lowest P/E multiple of the Mag 7 at 26.0x but is middle of the pack for revenue growth at 14.4% and tied for the lowest EPS growth at 12%. · December 2025 revenue projection of $46.97 billion · December 2025 EPS projection of $6.75 · 2025 EPS projection of $25.42 of EPS is a 26.0x P/E multiple · 2025 revenue projection of $186 billion for a 14.4% growth rate · Earnings growth rate of 12% on 2025 projected earnings · PEG (P/E to growth) ratio is 2.1x on 2025 projected earnings · Market cap to 2024 revenue ratio is 10.2x · Market cap to 2025 revenue ratio is 9.0x Meta’s stock has been in a continuous uptrend for over two years.

With an RSI of 52.46 (neutral territory) and closing a bit above its 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages, the moving averages could become support or resistance.

They have fallen over $80 and are trading just above its 50-day moving average with a neutral RSI of 47.10. Tesla stock price chart Apple reports on Thursday, January 30, after the market closes. It has the slowest revenue growth rate at 8.1% and tied for the slowest earnings growth of 12%. · December 2025 revenue projection of $124.04 billion · December 2025 EPS projection of $2.34 · 2025 EPS projection of $8.24 of EPS is a 27.9x P/E multiple · 2025 revenue projection of $446 billion for a 8.1% growth rate · Earnings growth rate of 12% on 2025 projected earnings · PEG (P/E to growth) ratio is 2.3x on 2025 projected earnings · Market cap to 2024 revenue ratio is 8.4x · Market cap to 2025 revenue ratio is 7.8x Apple’s shares doubled from early 2023 to December last year. From a closing high of $259.02 on December 26, it has fallen over $29 or 11% on various concerns, especially iPhone sales. After hitting an RSI of 30 (oversold territory) it has bounced back to 42.21 the last few days. Apple stock price chart Alphabet reports on Tuesday, February 4, after the market closes. It has the lowest P/E multiple at 21.4x and market cap to revenue ratio of 6.0x but middle of the pack revenue growth and tied for the slowest earnings growth. · December 2025 revenue projection of $96.67 billion · December 2025 EPS projection of $2.12 · 2025 EPS projection of $8.97 of EPS is a 21.4x P/E multiple · 2025 revenue projection of $391 billion for a 11.6% growth rate · Earnings growth rate of 12% on 2025 projected earnings · PEG (P/E to growth) ratio is 1.7x on 2025 projected earnings · Market cap to 2024 revenue ratio is 6.7x · Market cap to 2025 revenue ratio is 6.0x Alphabet has more than doubed since early 2023. It took the second largest hit on the market concerns about DeepSeek, which took its RSI down to 49.61 in neutral territory. Alphabet stock price chart Amazon reports on Thursday, February 6, after the market closes. It has the third highest earnings growth at 21% but the sixth lowest revenue growth at 10.7%.

After traders sold off global technology stocks en masse Monday on news of a Chinese artificial intelligence competitor, some aren’t too concerned with DeepSeek’s seemingly meteoric rise. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a note Tuesday that they “view the DeepSeek fear across the tech world as in essence a ‘tech AI head fake’ that will be short lived as more details and analysis comes out about DeepSeek’s model and China resources.” The sell-off led to a $1 trillion loss in market capitalization, with much of that driven by heavy bleeding in the tech sector. Nvidia (NVDA-5.19%) alone, which closed down 17% on Monday, shed $600 billion in market value — the largest single-day loss of any company in U.S. history. It ended the day with a share price of $118.68, bringing its market cap to $2.9 trillion. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading. Contracts for major U.S. indices were relatively flat early Tuesday. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.22%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.60%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. It also said it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. But Wedbush said it’s not worried about DeepSeek disrupting the planned $2 trillion in capital expenditures expected on AI in the coming years. “DeepSeek created an awesome LLM model (and credit to its software developers) however this Chinese AI small lab/LLM model is not bringing down the entire US tech ecosystem with it,” the analysts wrote. “Just like Temu was the ‘Amazon (AMZN-0.18%) model destroyer’ a few years ago... Amazon’s team adjusted and now look,” they said, referring it to the Chinese-origin e-commerce company that was feared to pose a major threat to competitors with its rock-bottom prices.

Title: Nvidia experiences record $600 billion market value loss following DeepSeek-R1 AI model launch

What just happened? Nvidia has once again broken the record for the largest one-day decline of market value in US history. After the release of the open-source R1 AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which caused panic within the industry, Team Green's shares dropped 17%, resulting in its market cap falling by almost $600 billion. Nvidia's stock price crashed to $118.58 yesterday, wiping $593 billion off its value and marking the company's worst day on the market since the start of the pandemic – March 16, 2020. The loss has seen Nvidia lose its position as the world's biggest company by market cap as its valuation fell from $3.5 trillion to $2.9 trillion, making it less valuable than Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's crash was the result of DeepSeek's free, open-source large language model called R1 that launched last week and is now the top app in the US Apple App store. The China-based firm says it trained its model with 671 billion parameters using just 2,048 Nvidia H800s and $5.6 million, which are tiny figures compared to the resources required by Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, who spend billions on their AI systems. DeepSeek's AI capabilities are said to be comparable to some of best available, including OpenAI's products. What makes this even more impressive is that DeepSeek created its model despite the limitations imposed by US export sanctions on China. The market's concern is that other companies will soon be able to replicate DeepSeek's achievement of creating high-end AI tools without spending billions on Nvidia's most expensive flagship GPUs. Nvidia's share price over the last month Other tech companies saw their share prices fall, with Arm, Broadcom and Oracle all crashing at least 10%. According to the Financial Post, the total market cap losses across US and European tech companies could exceed $1 trillion. DeepSeek's achievements have been praised by big Silicon Valley names such as Marc Andreessen and even Sam Altman, CEO of rival firm OpenAI, who called it an "impressive model." "We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!" Altman wrote. The record for the previous largest market cap fall also belongs to Nvidia. In September 2024, weak data on the state of the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management brought concerns about an economic slowdown. It led to $279 billion being wiped off the company's value, beating the $232 billion loss Meta suffered in February 2022. Nvidia's latest fall has also affected the wealth of CEO Jensen Huang, the company's largest individual shareholder, who saw his net worth drop $21 billion from $124.4 billion to $103.1 billion.

Title: Trump says DeepSeek's AI bombshell should be a 'wake-up call' for Big Tech

The release of DeepSeek-R1, a new open-source reasoning model from a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, should be a “wake-up call” for the U.S. tech industry, President Donald Trump said. While speaking at a gathering of House Republican lawmakers on Monday night in Miami, Trump called for American tech companies to be “laser-focused” on competing with rivals like DeepSeek. “When you hear a DeepSeek, when you hear somebody — somebody come up with something, we always have the ideas. We’re always first,” Trump said at the event. “So, I would say that’s a positive... instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.” DeepSeek in December released a model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia (NVDA-5.19%) H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia. The release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks on Monday. DeepSeek also published a new set of AI models that the company said can outperform OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion Xl. DeepSeek’s Janus-Pro model family is published under a license that allows it to be used commercially without restrictions. Last week, Trump invited executives at OpenAI, Japanese investment bank SoftBank (SFTBY-0.99%), and software company Oracle (ORCL-1.55%) to the White House to announce Stargate, a joint venture that plans to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next four years. The project is planned to exclusively serve OpenAI, The Financial Times reported. Through a sweeping executive order, Trump has also revoked his predecessor’s 2023 executive order on AI safety and security, which was praised by a trade group representing U.S. tech companies, including Amazon (AMZN-0.18%) and Google (GOOGL-0.08%). He also signed a new order directing a group of White House tech and science officials to develop a new AI action plan within 180 days. “DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same,” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and top Trump advisor on cryptocurrency and AI, wrote on X. “I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” he added. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Nvidia (NVDA-5.19%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday morning after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading, after closing down almost 17% on Monday, to $118.58. Nvidia shed almost $600 billion in value in a single day, the largest of any U.S. company in history, and lost its spot as the world’s most valuable company, bringing its market capitalization to $2.9 trillion. Other major chip stocks also sank Monday, including ASML (ASML+3.24%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.19%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.07%), Micron (MU+0.06%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-1.05%) That sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3%. In all, markets saw roughly $1 trillion in market cap loss to start the week. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.22%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.60%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. As its stock plunged, Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek is “an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.” “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” a spokesperson said. Markets were relatively flat as of Tuesday morning, with Nasdaq futures up just 0.11%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46 points, and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.05%. Broadcom also rose almost 3%. The sell-off Monday underscored just how concentrated the market has become. Leaders in the AI and chip space, including the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, drove much of the market’s returns in 2024. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS+0.82%) have warned that the “extremely high level of market concentration” poses significant risks to future returns from the broader market. The analysts said the premium valuation for the top 10 stocks is the largest since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. These 10 companies, which include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT-0.68%), Amazon (AMZN-0.18%), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL-0.08%), and Meta, accounted for 36% of the S&P 500 and drove much of the index’s returns last year.

The software giant's stock price is up less than 8% in the past year. That's by far the weakest gain among the eight U.S. tech megacap companies. Apple has the next slimmest increase at 19%, followed by Alphabet at 26%. All the others are up at least 48%, and Tesla is the top performer in the group, up 117%. Microsoft is also badly trailing the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has gained 25% in the past year. That's the backdrop heading into Microsoft's quarterly earnings report Wednesday. The company is kicking off tech earnings season, along with Meta and Tesla. Apple follows on Thursday, and Alphabet and Amazon report next week. The biggest question for Microsoft shareholders surrounds the company's Azure cloud-computing business and whether it will show accelerating growth. In October, Microsoft told investors that demand for Azure services outstripped supply because of a delay from a third-party provider. Finance chief Amy Hood said she still foresees an increase in Azure's growth rate in the first half of 2025, but for the December quarter, she called for 31% to 32% growth at constant currency, which would be down from 34% in the prior period. Microsoft's stock slipped 6% the next day. Since the last quarter of 2023, Azure growth has increased by 2 percentage points. Meanwhile, top rivals Amazon and Alphabet have seen cloud growth over that stretch accelerate by 7 points and 13 points, respectively. It's a matter of particular importance to investors, because Microsoft now has tens of billions of dollars in quarterly capital expenditures to meet cloud and AI needs of customers. A Microsoft spokesperson didn't provide a comment. Microsoft operates in many other markets. But investors gravitate to cloud first, because it's a sizable category that's still rapidly expanding as companies continue to move away from owning and operating their own data centers and as they add heftier workloads. Overall, Microsoft is expected to report revenue growth of 11% from a year earlier to $68.8 billion, according to LSEG. That would mark the slowest year-over-year growth for any quarter since mid-2023. Analysts expect earnings per share to increase to $3.11 from $2.93 a year ago. Investors were more bullish on Microsoft in 2023, sending the stock up more than 50%, its best year since 2009. The driving force was Microsoft's intimate relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which sparked the generative AI boom and led to a historic increase in investments. Microsoft is OpenAI's leading backer, having poured nearly $14 billion into the AI startup. Through the partnership, Microsoft gets a lot of cloud business but also spends heavily on building out infrastructure. The relationship changed in an important way last week, when Microsoft said OpenAI will no longer use Azure on an exclusive basis, except when it comes to handling incoming queries from developers. Going forward, OpenAI will have to check with Microsoft when it seeks more computing capacity, and Microsoft will be able to accept or turn away the request. The announcement came at the same time as President Donald Trump's introduction of Stargate, an AI infrastructure initiative involving SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle. In its own blog post, OpenAI named Microsoft as a technology partner but not a member of the group that will build and operate Stargate, which has the potential to draw up to $500 billion in investment. Microsoft has committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures in the year that ends June 30. Much of that is being directed toward Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Analysts at Cowen wrote in a report that last week's developments could help Microsoft reaccelerate the Azure growth rate into the mid-30s. They said Microsoft has been "funding GPU capex investments for OpenAI model training but not collecting revenue," and that by pushing some of that training elsewhere, the company can "show improved capex efficiencies and stronger returns on capital spend" while keeping its access to OpenAI. Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, said he expects the AI investment will pay off in the long run. "If AI doesn't show up, there's still a long runway for cloud," said Walkush, whose firm held about $913 million in Microsoft shares at the end of September. "But I think the chance of AI showing up is really high, so that's the bet I'm willing to let them make to take advantage of this opportunity."

Title: Forbes Daily: DeepSeek’s ‘Wake-Up Call’ And Nvidia’s Historic Plunge

Plus: With the release of its fourth quarter losses, Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches to six years, but the plane maker does have a path toward billions in revenue. Good morning, The debut of a new AI model from China’s DeepSeek sent markets into a frenzy Monday. DeepSeek, which released its open-source models for download in the U.S. earlier this month, surged to the top of the iOS App Store download charts. It’s been compared favorably to products from OpenAI and Meta, while appearing to be more efficient and cost-effective. The competition from the Chinese company spooked investors, tanking the fortunes of several notable billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO and largest individual shareholder Jensen Huang. Huang’s net worth fell $20.8 billion by market close, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison lost $27.6 billion, falling from the third-richest person on Earth to fifth. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Markets plunged Monday after the debut of DeepSeek, hitting tech stocks especially hard as the Nasdaq had its fourth-worst day of the last two years. Semiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia plunged 17%, losing $589 billion in market capitalization—by far the single greatest one-day value wipeout of any company in history. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek, calling it “a positive development” and a “wake-up call” for U.S. industries. MORE: A Forbes review found the AI model avoids answering questions about topics commonly censored by the Chinese government. Forbes asked DeepSeek five questions on controversial topics, like “What is Taiwan’s status with China?” and “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” Investor interest in the first big IPO of Trump 2.0—liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global—has been lukewarm. The stock has already fallen nearly 20%, but it still solidifies Venture Global’s place in the public markets with an impressive $50 billion market cap. And the holdings of its cofounders now amount to $20 billion each. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Controversial billionaire Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s bet on Amer Sports, the parent company of such brands as Arc’teryx and Salomon, appears to be paying off. Wilson, who left his role as Lululemon’s board chair in 2013 following his controversial comments about women’s bodies, sold shares of the company to buy a nearly 21% stake in Amer Sports. That investment is now worth about $3.2 billion, double its value when the company went public in February 2024. Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Google Maps will display the name “Gulf of America” instead of the “Gulf of Mexico” for U.S. users once government sources are updated to reflect the name change ordered by President Donald Trump last week, the tech giant announced Monday. The company said it has a “longstanding practice” of applying name changes when they have been “updated in official government sources.” President Donald Trump signed three executive orders Monday targeting military personnel in an expansion of his crackdown on DEI initiatives. The orders not only rescinded the military’s DEI practices, they also banned transgender individuals from serving, and reinstated service members who were fired for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine. There were around 14,000 transgender service members in the U.S. military as of 2018, according to CNN. Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images Tickets to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the Super Bowl are listed for as much as $56,000 on the secondary market, indicating that this year’s championship game could be the priciest in NFL history. The cheapest seats on Gametime were available for $6,492 per ticket, though Super Bowl tickets typically decline in price in the two weeks leading up to game day. In a memo issued Monday, the acting director of the National Institutes of Health reiterated that the Department of Health and Human Services has “issued a pause” on communications and public appearances by agency staff. But the document also states that clinical trials at the NIH and its funded institutions are ongoing. Still, NIH staffers remain frustrated, with one source saying that “there have never been politics in the NIH. When politics is suddenly becoming involved, that’s where the fear in large part is coming from.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly received guidance to immediately stop working with the World Health Organization, following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations agency. While Trump can withdraw the United States from WHO, the U.S. must give a “one-year notice” and meet its financial obligations to the agency for that fiscal year, according to a joint resolution from 1948. The IRS has made moves to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing hiring for most federal agencies. The agency is revoking some job offers and removing job postings. And last week, Trump suggested he might fire IRS employees—or send them to the border. The Boeing logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. TOPLINE When it comes to losing money, Boeing is an overperformer—of historic proportion. On Thursday, the beleaguered plane maker pre-announced a net loss of $5.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which pencils out to about $3.8 billion. That’s a stunning $11.8 billion loss for the year, the second largest in Boeing history. The lousy news is partly due to the disruption of a seven-week strike by Boeing’s machinists that halted production of the company’s bestselling plane, the 737 Max. It’s also a result of costly, chronic delays on key programs in Boeing’s defense division. And then there are the company’s seemingly endless struggles to straighten out production problems with the 737 Max and 787. Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches six years, starting with the grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 following two deadly crashes. Its total losses since that time: a staggering $35.7 billion. Despite Boeing’s dismal run, institutional investors have been willing to shore up the company’s finances thanks to the company’s fat order book of 5,595 planes, which should convert into billions in revenue if new CEO Kelly Ortberg can get its production lines humming smoothly again. The company raised $24 billion late last year through a sale of stock and convertible debt. WHY IT MATTERS Fourth-quarter earnings season isn’t done yet, but Boeing’s discouraging 2024 results are almost certain to bolster the company’s lead as the biggest loser in the S&P 500 index since 2019, according to data from FactSet. Uber, which was running a close second to Boeing through 2023, is expected to report a profit for 2024.

Plus: With the release of its fourth quarter losses, Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches to six years, but the plane maker does have a path toward billions in revenue. Good morning, The debut of a new AI model from China’s DeepSeek sent markets into a frenzy Monday. DeepSeek, which released its open-source models for download in the U.S. earlier this month, surged to the top of the iOS App Store download charts. It’s been compared favorably to products from OpenAI and Meta, while appearing to be more efficient and cost-effective. The competition from the Chinese company spooked investors, tanking the fortunes of several notable billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO and largest individual shareholder Jensen Huang. Huang’s net worth fell $20.8 billion by market close, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison lost $27.6 billion, falling from the third-richest person on Earth to fifth. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Markets plunged Monday after the debut of DeepSeek, hitting tech stocks especially hard as the Nasdaq had its fourth-worst day of the last two years. Semiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia plunged 17%, losing $589 billion in market capitalization—by far the single greatest one-day value wipeout of any company in history. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek, calling it “a positive development” and a “wake-up call” for U.S. industries. MORE: A Forbes review found the AI model avoids answering questions about topics commonly censored by the Chinese government. Forbes asked DeepSeek five questions on controversial topics, like “What is Taiwan’s status with China?” and “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” Investor interest in the first big IPO of Trump 2.0—liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global—has been lukewarm. The stock has already fallen nearly 20%, but it still solidifies Venture Global’s place in the public markets with an impressive $50 billion market cap. And the holdings of its cofounders now amount to $20 billion each. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Controversial billionaire Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s bet on Amer Sports, the parent company of such brands as Arc’teryx and Salomon, appears to be paying off. Wilson, who left his role as Lululemon’s board chair in 2013 following his controversial comments about women’s bodies, sold shares of the company to buy a nearly 21% stake in Amer Sports. That investment is now worth about $3.2 billion, double its value when the company went public in February 2024. Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Google Maps will display the name “Gulf of America” instead of the “Gulf of Mexico” for U.S. users once government sources are updated to reflect the name change ordered by President Donald Trump last week, the tech giant announced Monday. The company said it has a “longstanding practice” of applying name changes when they have been “updated in official government sources.” President Donald Trump signed three executive orders Monday targeting military personnel in an expansion of his crackdown on DEI initiatives. The orders not only rescinded the military’s DEI practices, they also banned transgender individuals from serving, and reinstated service members who were fired for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine. There were around 14,000 transgender service members in the U.S. military as of 2018, according to CNN. Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images Tickets to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the Super Bowl are listed for as much as $56,000 on the secondary market, indicating that this year’s championship game could be the priciest in NFL history. The cheapest seats on Gametime were available for $6,492 per ticket, though Super Bowl tickets typically decline in price in the two weeks leading up to game day. In a memo issued Monday, the acting director of the National Institutes of Health reiterated that the Department of Health and Human Services has “issued a pause” on communications and public appearances by agency staff. But the document also states that clinical trials at the NIH and its funded institutions are ongoing. Still, NIH staffers remain frustrated, with one source saying that “there have never been politics in the NIH. When politics is suddenly becoming involved, that’s where the fear in large part is coming from.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly received guidance to immediately stop working with the World Health Organization, following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations agency. While Trump can withdraw the United States from WHO, the U.S. must give a “one-year notice” and meet its financial obligations to the agency for that fiscal year, according to a joint resolution from 1948. The IRS has made moves to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing hiring for most federal agencies. The agency is revoking some job offers and removing job postings. And last week, Trump suggested he might fire IRS employees—or send them to the border. The Boeing logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. TOPLINE When it comes to losing money, Boeing is an overperformer—of historic proportion. On Thursday, the beleaguered plane maker pre-announced a net loss of $5.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which pencils out to about $3.8 billion. That’s a stunning $11.8 billion loss for the year, the second largest in Boeing history. The lousy news is partly due to the disruption of a seven-week strike by Boeing’s machinists that halted production of the company’s bestselling plane, the 737 Max. It’s also a result of costly, chronic delays on key programs in Boeing’s defense division. And then there are the company’s seemingly endless struggles to straighten out production problems with the 737 Max and 787. Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches six years, starting with the grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 following two deadly crashes. Its total losses since that time: a staggering $35.7 billion. Despite Boeing’s dismal run, institutional investors have been willing to shore up the company’s finances thanks to the company’s fat order book of 5,595 planes, which should convert into billions in revenue if new CEO Kelly Ortberg can get its production lines humming smoothly again.

Title: AMD Expected To Lose Out On Taiwan Semi Tariffs; Melius Research Thinks NVIDIA Is Going To “Come For Them” Via Arm-based CPUs

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. DeepSeek's R1 AI model seems to have undermined the prevailing narrative around hyperscalers, wounding NVIDIA in the process. Even so, NVIDIA remains the strongest horse in the proverbial stable. As evidence, look no further than AMD, which has just received another downgrade, and that too on a vector wholly unrelated to the ongoing DeepSeek-related saga. Melius Downgrades $AMD to Hold from Buy, Cuts PT to $129 from $160, Cites Increased Pressure on Profit Pools Analyst comments: "We should have done this 10 months ago after an epic run for AMD (up over 40% at one point in 1Q24) - so we better have a reason. Believe it or not,… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) January 28, 2025 To wit, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes has now downgraded AMD to a 'Hold' rating, while conceding that he should have done so "10 months ago." Reitzes then points out that his AMD downgrade is wholly unrelated to the DeepSeek saga or the likely disappointing 2025 sales numbers for the MI300 GPU: "Believe it or not, it's not due to DeepSeek. We cut numbers already on January 6th on GPUs, and the stock actually went up 3%, so a guide down on disappointing MI300 sales for 2025 is already expected." Instead, Reitzes asserts that Melius is now "more cautious on x86 server and PC over the long term for AMD," based on the conviction that "NVIDIA is going to increasingly 'come for them' in both markets [CPU and GPU] with their Arm-based CPUs that are optimized for accelerated PCs." The analyst goes on to note: "We are increasingly concerned that custom CPUs and Nvidia CPUs will cannibalize even more of the x86 server market long-term, even though AMD's current chip, Turin, is doing well." Accordingly, Melius Research has reduced its target for AMD shares from $160 to $129, implying an upside potential of ~12 percent relative to the stock's current pre-market price of $115.25. Bear in mind that HSBC recently noted that "AMD's AI GPU roadmap is less competitive than previously anticipated, limiting its penetration into the AI GPU market." Also, Wolfe Research noted in December 2024 that "AMD won’t be in a position to guide AI for CY25 – which will in itself drive concerns."

Title: AAPL climbed 3% on DeepSeek news, as other tech stocks fell

While shock at yesterday’s DeepSeek news saw the stock prices of many tech giants fall, AAPL climbed 3.25% across the course of the day. Experts yesterday expressed amazement at the Chinese company’s AI model being on a par with US chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama despite being developed for a fraction of the cost and running on far lower-spec hardware … DeepSeek is an AI chatbot developed in China, and which posted benchmarks indicating that its performance was comparable to the world’s best existing models. Experts quickly verified the claims, expressing shock that China was able to achieve this at a fraction of the development cost of US models, and running locally on very modestly-specced PCs. Many said that the scale of this achievement cannot be over-stated. The app quickly climbed to the #1 slot in Apple’s App Store. The biggest shock was how China was able to develop such a powerful AI model while US export controls limited the number of Nvidia GPUs it was able to purchase. We noted yesterday that chatbots from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic use more than half a million of these, while DeepSeek was only able to obtain around 50,000 GPUs – meaning it’s delivering comparable results with only 10% of the processing power. It was previously thought that there was a direct correlation between the number of Nvidia processors and AI performance, so evidence to the contrary saw Nvidia shares slump. The results sent a shockwave through markets on Monday, with Nvidia on course to lose more than $300bn of market value, the biggest recorded drop for any company, as investors reassessed the likely future investment in AI hardware. The share value of other US AI players like Microsoft and Meta similarly fell. There was, however, an exception to the trend: AAPL stock climbed 3.25% in the course of the day. Daring Fireball’s John Gruber suggested that a key reason might be that it validates Apple’s approach of aiming to run as much AI stuff as it can on-device. Its own AI servers are the next recourse, with ChatGPT as fallback. There has been skepticism about just how many Apple Intelligence features can be powered by the company’s own device chips, rather than having powerful servers do the lifting, but DeepSeek runs on rather ordinary PCs – suggesting that Apple’s approach could be far more successful than anyone has so far imagined. A vast increase in the inference capabilities of RAM-constrained hardware strongly suggests that Apple’s consumer devices will soon be able to perform far more AI functionality locally. Whether or not he’s correct about the impact on the share price, there’s no arguing that Apple’s case for on-device processing just got way more credible.

DeepSeek, an artificial intelligence lab based in Hangzhou, released a reasoning model called R1 last week that outperformed OpenAI's latest model in many third-party tests. In late December, DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model that it said took only two months and less than $6 million to build. The startup was founded in 2023. While there's plenty of skepticism surrounding DeepSeek's claims, the latest pronouncements caused a panic on Wall Street due to the potential implications of significantly cheaper AI models coming sooner rather than later. Nvidia's stock price plummeted 17% on Monday, its steepest drop since the early days of the Covid pandemic in March 2020. The sell-off wiped out almost $600 billion in market cap, the biggest one-day loss ever for a U.S. company. Shares of chipmaker Broadcom, which has also benefited from the AI boom, also dropped 17%. And Oracle, Dell, Super Micro Computer and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise all saw steep declines because they sell servers packed with Nvidia graphics processing units. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla all report quarterly results Wednesday and are among the megacap tech companies spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, with the biggest checks going to pay for Nvidia's GPUs. Apple reports results Thursday, followed by Alphabet and Amazon next week. The big immediate issues for those companies with respect to DeepSeek are less about revenue and more about costs. It's a topic they tend to spend a lot of time talking about on earnings calls. "The sheer efficiency of DeepSeek's pre and post training framework (if true) raises the question as to whether or not global hyperscalers and governments, that have and continue to invest significant capex dollars into AI infrastructure, may pause to consider the innovative methodologies that have come to light with DeepSeek's research," wrote analysts at Stifel in a report Monday. Investors hope to get some initial answers in earnings reports this week and next. Nvidia doesn't report until late February, and Broadcom is expected to announce results in March. Here's how DeepSeek could come up on this week's earnings calls. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Friday that his company plans to invest around $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it bulks up its AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg talks extensively about AI on his company's quarterly updates, and likes to tout advancements in its open-source Llama family of LLMs. Given how much Meta spends on Nvidia GPUs, any change in the market dynamics is of deep interest to shareholders. Some tech investors have expressed concern about the hefty amount of spending on AI relative to the immediate returns companies are seeing. Ralph Schackart, an analyst at William Blair, told CNBC that DeepSink's recent claims about its allegedly cheaper and quicker-to-train open source AI model "caught everybody by surprise, but it's hard to know whether that investment is real or not." Meta's stock price rose almost 2% on Monday, garnering a very different response from Wall Street compared with Nvidia and the other hardware companies. The potential of lower costs could be a boon for Meta. But, like Llama, DeepSeek is open source, so there's also the possible competitive threat if developers gravitate to another model. The one thing Schackart said investors can be sure of is that Meta will continue investing in AI. "There's too much to gain or lose by not investing," he said. Microsoft slid 2.1% on Monday, a drop that was narrower than the overall tech market's decline. Among the large software and internet companies, Microsoft is closest to the AI boom due to its intimate relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The roughly $14 billion that Microsoft has pumped into OpenAI has been critical for the startup, which needs boatloads of GPUs to build and run its models. DeepSeek is going directly up against OpenAI. In a post on X late Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called R1 "an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price." He added that OpenAI will deliver better models, but that it's "legit invigorating to have a new competitor!" In addition to funneling money to OpenAI, Microsoft is a big spender on its own when it comes to GPUs for its AI products and its Azure cloud-computing service. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the rise of DeepSeek is a positive development for the company because of the possibility of lower capital expenditures. However, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan sees DeepSeek as a negative sign for Microsoft, which "has bet more on proprietary models (OpenAI) and higher-cost hardware," he wrote in a report. Microsoft said Jan. 3 that it plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on the construction of data centers that can handle AI workloads. On his social network, X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who also runs SpaceX, expressed doubt that DeepSeek's models were created on the reportedly low budget of under $10 million. But Musk showed appreciation for DeepSeek's technical achievements. Musk has a history in the space. He was a co-founder of OpenAI, when it was launched as a nonprofit in 2015, but he's now involved in a heated legal battle with the company and Altman and is suing to stop OpenAI from transforming into a for-profit entity. Musk is also founder of AI startup and OpenAI competitor xAI, which is raising billions of dollars, largely to buy Nvidia GPUs. At Tesla, Musk has been ramping up AI spending as the company works toward building a fleet of self-driving cars. Musk has talked about his company's sizable AI investments as a key advantage. He said in a post on X in April that Tesla would spend $10 billion for the year "in combined training and inference AI." UBS analysts wrote in a note Monday that, "greater efficiency to both model training and inference can help advance, and eventually proliferate," autonomous vehicles. However, they added that affordable open-source models "could break the narrative that the more capital put into compute and infrastructure, the more likely the probability of success, thereby lessening any 'moat'" Tesla has established. Tesla shares fell 2.3% on Monday. Investors didn't express any concern about Apple on Monday. The stock rose 3.2% for the day, outperforming all of its closest peers. Apple is less profligate than its rivals in terms of capital expenditures. In the company's latest fiscal year, it spent $9.5 billion on capex, 14% less than in 2023. Unlike some of its tech competitors, Apple doesn't run a cloud service that rents out computing capacity. The company's big AI bet so far has been around Apple Intelligence, its suite of software for iPhones and Macs that can summarize text and generate images. Apple's suite runs on its own chips, either on the user's device or on the company's servers. For training its models, Apple has published research saying that its initial models for Apple Intelligence used Google's proprietary Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, a chip that's more limited than a GPU but can handle some AI tasks. Apple contracts with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Siri voice assistant, which is powered by pricey Nvidia GPUs. That's a topic that could be of interest to analysts after the DeepSeek developments.

DeepSeek AI is making headlines because the Chinese startup has developed cutting-edge and cost-effective large-language models using fewer GPUs than systems costing billions from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. With the company's flagship R1 model performing on par with OpenAI's o1, this has spilled over to the financial markets, where NVIDIA's stock dipped to the point where it saw the biggest single-day drop in US history. Despite its market cap dropping by several hundreds of billions, NVIDIA recently released a statement praising DeepSeek as "an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling." DeepSeek's efforts are being widely praised because it didn't require billions of dollars of AI hardware to train. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman released a short statement earlier today on social media on DeepSeek R1, praising it as an "impressive model" while teasing "much better models" coming soon from the company. He also said that OpenAI will bring a few releases forward in response to DeepSeek's surprising and immediate success. While also teasing AGI. "DeepSeek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price," Sam Altman wrote on X. "We will obviously deliver much better models, and also, it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases." "But mostly, we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission," Sam Altman adds, hinting that OpenAI won't be scaling back its use of countless GPUs for its training anytime soon. "The world is going to want to use a lot of AI and really be quite amazed by the next-gen models coming. We look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond."

Title: Jim Cramer’s Broadcom (AVGO) Prediction Was Spot On

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC discussed the reasons behind the recent market declines after the ISM Services Index data. Cramer said many are still expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve soon but they are wrong. “This survey showed surprising strength, so much strength that it makes you think that the FED might not give us more rate cuts anytime soon. Right now, a ton of investors believe that the FED needs to push through a bunch of rate cuts in order to revive the economy. Lots of those bulls are counting on those cuts. That seems wrong today. They were rocked to the core because not only have they been wrong, but they’re starting to question the FED’s credibility. They know nothing,” Cramer said. Cramer said he was “mystified” by the Fed’s rate cuts amid strong economic data. “These traders are wondering why the heck the FED cut short rates by 50 basis points September then give another 25 in November another 25 in December what the heck did they see that made them so aggressive judging by the data. Nothing. The credibility issue, if you claim you’re data dependent, and the data is strong then why the heck are you cutting so aggressively.” Cramer at the time said the latest nonfarm payrolls report would be one of the most important indicators of the economy and it would set the “dialog” in the coming days. Sure it will. The latest jobs data showed unemployment fell and job additions crushed Wall Street expectations. Many now believe the Fed is set to put brakes on rate cuts. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 stocks Cramer recently talked about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 In early November, answering a question about a company, Jim Cramer said: “The semiconductor stocks are so hated that I have to urge you to buy a regular semiconductor right now because they are being put for sale like you wouldn’t believe. But go buy Broadcom, go buy Broadcom, AVGO, and you will like it more than Ultra. I’ll tell you, really.” Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Analyst Upside as of January 23, 2025: 43% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Some of Adobe Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) major products include Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, and Adobe GenStudio. In October 2024, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) launched the Firefly Video Model in beta, expanding its family of creative generative AI models, safe for commercial use. Similarly, in December 2024, the company announced a partnership with Box, Inc. to shape the way digital media is created and used. Similarly, in an exciting update, on January 22, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced innovations to its AI tools and a $5 million investment in its Adobe Film and TV Fund to support underprivileged creators and filmmakers. Speaking of its innovations, ADBE unveiled new features in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io to improve post-production and reduce the time spent on videos. Overall, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the company’s digital media segment grew its revenue by 12%. The company holds precedence in the creative industry because of its exemplary tools and features. In addition to that, investors are particularly interested to see how its investments in AI play out in 2025 and beyond. Polen Capital’s Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.” Overall, ADBE ranks 7th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Nvidia Stock Goes Down—And The Internet Cracks Up
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/callumbooth/2025/01/28/nvidia-stock-goes-down-and-the-internet-cracks-up/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T11:05:37Z

A Nvidia logo is seen on a smartphone with stock market percentages on the background. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The biggest market loss in history happened on Jan. 27, with with Nvidia stock plummeting 17% by the close of U.S. markets. This led to a record $589 billion loss in market capitalization. Stockbrokers and investors panicked, but how did the online world react? Well, it did what it does best: joked about the whole debacle. The Nvidia stock drop story is an interesting case study about the meta-ness and circularity of the internet; specifically about how social media can influence financial markets and then mock that very influence. To reach that conclusion, though, we have to understand precisely what’s happening with Nvidia stock, and why it’s dropping. Over the past week, the launch of a new artificial intelligence (AI) model called DeepSeek R1 sent shockwaves through the tech industry. Without getting bogged down in detail, this open-source AI is reported to deliver the same performance as models from other companies, such as OpenAI, but at a far lower cost. In other words, DeepSeek R1 needs less processing power to complete the same tasks. Nvidia makes the hardware (GPUs) that these big AI models need, so improved efficiency means that, potentially, companies need less of its gear. This is one of the key reasons why Nvidia stock nosedived. Following the launch of DeepSeek, Nvidia’s future seems less bright to some investors. There are a few different ways social media responded to Nvidia stock plummeting. One of the most common involve people making memes about the lowering price: Others repurposed popular meme formats to join in: While different accounts took a more surreal approach with their jokes: It isn’t just all pure japes and memes though. Some people online also tried to contextualize what’s happening with Nvidia stock: Or talk about the absurdity of Nvidia’s stock price in general: The common thread throughout all of these is a sense of humor, but why? What’s happening for the internet to act this way? While there are a variety of threads that can explain why social media has reacted the way it has to the Nvidia stock drop—including schadenfreude at the downfall of a company—one of the most interesting tends is the sense of meta-ness at play in the story. One reason that stories about DeepSeek have spread far and wide is down to social media. Because, as research published on Scientific Reports shows, extreme opinions receive more likes on platforms, this means that, on average, a post saying DeepSeek is going to destroy the AI industry will get more engagement than a more balanced one. More likes tends to equate to more views, meaning stories that predict a rocky future for Nvidia stock likely get more traction online than those which are more objective. While some believe this doesn’t have any real impact in the world, studies suggest otherwise. Social media has been shown to directly impact stock prices. In a paper from Nature, researchers “discovered significant short-term and long-term relationships between social media discussions and market behaviour.” While these platforms are far from the sole reason Nvidia stock and the like can rise and fall, they do have an impact. And this is where things get particularly interesting. People mocking Nvidia stock on social media are, in some sense, mocking the fact that social media had something to do with it. The internet is almost like a snake eating its own tail. Social media helped drive down Nvidia’s stock price and is also the place where people make fun of that happening. It’s a never-ending cycle. Ultimately, whether people know it consciously or not, there’s a sense of ridiculousness that something as seemingly silly as posting on social media can impact the fortunes of one of the most valuable companies in the entire world. It’s meta, it’s self-referential, but, most of all, it’s a sign of the strangeness of the modern world. So what comes next? It’s likely that, at some point, Nvidia stock will recover, but after that? The only certainty is whatever happens with AI, the economy and the world in general, social media is sure to joke about it. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Institutional investors in KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) see US$7.3b decrease in market cap last week, although long-term gains have benefitted them.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, KLA's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 88% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$7.3b last week. However, the 18% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of KLA. See our latest analysis for KLA Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. KLA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of KLA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in KLA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 4.5% of the stock. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of KLA Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$115m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over KLA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for KLA that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

Title: Tom Lee Calls Monday's Market Plunge a Great Buying Opportunity After AI, Crypto-Led Rout

Tom Lee, head of Fundstrat Research, discussed Monday's market sell-off as an "overreaction". On CNBC, Lee said that the double-digit drawdown in NVIDIA (NVDA) is the biggest opportunity since the covid outbreak and will prove to be a great buying moment. "Markets don't like uncertainty, to me, it's an overreaction, and this overreaction will be a great opportunity for investors," Lee said. Lee's call seems good so far. After Nasdaq sold off 3% and NVIDIA dropped 17%, ,Nasdaq futures are up 1% while NVDA is 5% higher in pre-market trading. Monday's sell-off in NVDA was the biggest single-day market cap loss in history, with NVIDIA losing $465 billion in market cap, according to Bloomberg Data. Bitcoin (BTC) fell as far as $97,500 on Monday and is already back above $103,000; but was as high as $105,000 before the news came out on the AI China's DeepSeek; this will be a level bulls will look to reclaim in the short-term. AI bitcoin miners also saw massive drawdowns, as much as 30%, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which is now slightly higher in pre-market. Lee also alludes to a healthy market structure in U.S. equities and notes that bitcoin has outperformed small caps and financials year to date. Wednesday turns to a Federal Reserve policy meeting which is largely expected for the federal funds rate to be paused at the 4:25-4:50 rate. Lee says there is some uncertainty going into the meeting as markets are currently too hawkish and believe the market is putting too much emphasis on a potential rate hike in 2025.

Title: Chinese Quant Whiz Built DeepSeek In The Shadow Of a Hedge Fund Rout

(Bloomberg) -- Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng’s quantitative hedge fund firm apologized profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China’s stock market. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding Budapest Mayor Aims to Block Orban’s Plans to Build ‘Mini Dubai’ It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country’s largest quant funds. As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek. DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global artificial intelligence supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm’s breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia Corp. and other peers. It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match — and even surpass — the best in the field. “Every country in the world could have that kind of a project going on, if they can acquire the talent and be able to work on it, of course. The rest of the industry is going to learn from this,” said Shuman Ghosemajumder, co-founder and CEO of Reken, a San Francisco-based AI startup. The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models — and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition. Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen. Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. “OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,” Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024. The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn’t necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a “lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,” he was quoted as saying. An Outlier Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China’s southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master’s degree in information and communication engineering there. High-Flyer was as much an outlier in China’s quant industry as DeepSeek is to the global AI industry. Liang and two of his former university classmates started dabbling in domestic stocks in 2008. Unlike the founders of most Chinese quant funds, none of them had overseas or institutional trading experience. The trio tried different strategies from discretionary trading to arbitrage, before settling on using a systematic approach to implement trading ideas in 2015, the year they set up High-Flyer. They initially built a model based on price-and-volume factors, before trying machine learning in 2016. The new tool allowed the firm to dig deeper to find new factors and identify “non-linear” connections between factors, its chief executive officer Simon Lu said in an interview in 2020. The founders integrated machine learning into High-Flyer products in 2018. AI allowed High-Flyer to achieve “a lot of innovations” and develop a multi-strategy, multi-cycle investment model to “pile up” returns from different sources of returns, according to a 2020 brochure for the firm. Its flagship product benchmarked against the CSI 500 Index integrated low-risk strategies like intra-day trading, allowing it to beat the gauge by a combined 120 percentage points in the previous three years, it showed. High-Flyer grew assets quickly as a result, reaching more than 90 billion yuan in 2021 before it stumbled later that year. In December 2021, after experiencing record drawdowns at some funds, High-Flyer said its artificial intelligence mistimed some trades and performed poorly during periods of large stock swings. “We feel deeply guilty,” it told investors. The firm also stopped accepting fresh inflows and said it would reduce its assets under management and adjust its strategies. Three months later, its marketing head warned that certain volatility-sensitive clients should redeem their money — a highly unusual move. Last year, High-Flyer said it would wind down products that had made two-way bets on the markets, and focus on “long-only” strategies in which it took only bullish positions on stocks. Its assets under management have dropped to around 60 billion yuan. Research Funding DeepSeek’s research was funded by High-Flyer’s R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and other graphics processing units. Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. “He’s a nerd but nerd in this context is not a negative,” said Zihan Wang, a Ph.D. student at Northwestern University who did a six-month internship at DeepSeek in 2024. Wang said Liang ran many experiments on his own, and DeepSeek operated much like a research lab. “It started small, but as they got real progress, they started to get excited,” he said. The startup began periodically releasing models, seemingly impervious to — even stirred up by — the US ban on exports of cutting-edge AI accelerator chips. DeepSeek released its R1 advanced AI reasoning model on Jan. 20, the same day Donald Trump was sworn in as America’s 47th president. Earlier that Monday, Liang attended a closed-door business symposium in Beijing that was hosted by Chinese Premier Li Qiang. There, experts in technology, science, education and other fields offered their opinions and suggestions for a draft government work report, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Video footage on YouTube shows Liang sitting across the table from Li and speaking, with the Chinese leader nodding attentively. Significantly, DeepSeek open sourced its R1, allowing researchers and developers to freely use, modify and commercialize the model. That sent a signal that it wants to collaborate and innovate with others in the global AI community. Liang stands out among Chinese entrepreneurs because of that non-commercial goal, his laser-focus on research and the realization of Artificial General Intelligence, said Thomas Qitong Cao, assistant professor of technology policy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Liang is assumed to own 51% of High-Flyer. That would give him a stake worth $71 million based on a comparative analysis, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. If DeepSeek reaches the same potential as OpenAI, valued at roughly $150 billion, the founder could potentially be in line for a massive windfall. Some have questioned whether Liang’s DeepSeek is as promising as it appears. Shortcomings include the startup’s infrastructure’s ability to handle global traffic waiting to try its service, or the app’s handling of sensitive subjects such as the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square and queries on Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Experts have also questioned the assumption that DeepSeek was building with 10,000 A100 Nvidia chips, with analysts like Dylan Patel speculating that DeepSeek needs at least 50,000 of Nvidia’s far-more powerful chips, the H100s. Meta Platforms Inc., for instance, operates the equivalent of 600,000 Nvidia H100s. Still, Liang is prompting a rethink and re-calibration in the global AI ecosystem. It’s made obvious that the “The AI race won’t be won by creating the most sophisticated model; it’ll be won by embedding AI into business systems to generate tangible economic value,” said Mike Capone, chief executive officer of Qlik, a data analytics and artificial intelligence platform. --With assistance from Biz Carson, Pui Gwen Yeung and Pei Yi Mak.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market Monday, initiating a massive selloff led by Nvidia, which roared back Tuesday, recovering almost half of its record-setting losses, before again struggling Wednesday. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $160 billion Wednesday morning. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The market reacted negatively to DeepSeek's open-source AI release through shares of Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and U.S. tech stocks, but Wedbush analysts urge investors to see the dip as a chance to buy. DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou, announced its R1 AI model development took two months to complete while spending less than $6 million. The model achieved explosive popularity and ascended to become Apple's App Store's number one position. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. DeepSeek's R1 model threatens American giants OpenAI and Meta (META, Financial), yet Wedbush analyst Dan Ives dismisses its impact on Nvidia and competitor performance. DeepSeek's remarkable achievements face multiple hurdles because of strict U.S. chip export regulations, according to Ives' assessment. DeepSeek's ability to contend against established U.S. tech infrastructure is in serious doubt, according to his analysis. Ives interprets the current decline in United States tech shares because he notices frequent market patterns that make these price levels attractive to investors. The extensive corporate investment by U.S. firms in AI across numerous applications, including robotics and autonomous mobility, makes it difficult for DeepSeek to create meaningful competition. The analyst confirmed Nvidia continues to reign as the dominant AI hardware market leader. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Short-term bitcoin (BTC) holders exited the market at a loss Monday as tumbling prices also saw derivative traders throw in the towel, leading to a significant decline in open futures bets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Short-term holders, defined by Glassnode as addresses with a history of holding coins for less than 155 days, sent over 21,000 BTC ($2.2 billion) to exchanges at a loss as the largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 4.7%, the most in two weeks, according to CoinDesk Indexes pricing. The transfer to exchanges, often a precursor to sales, was the second-biggest this month and may reflect that purchasers who'd bought when the price was near record highs around $108,000 toward the start of the year were spooked by the sudden slide back into the five digits. These addresses, owned by active traders, new entrants and weak hands, tend to be sensitive to price gyrations and often succumb when prices slide. BTC fell to under $98,000 as the weekend release of the Chinese startup DeepSeek challenged U.S. leadership in AI and technology. Other corners of the market also hinted at capitulation, often observed at local price bottoms. For instance, the perpetual funding rates for BTC flipped negative, a sign of stronger demand for bearish bets. That’s usually when bitcoin reaches a low such as on Jan. 13, when bitcoin dipped below $90,000 and Aug. 5, during the yen carry trade unwind. The de-risking also happened on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, which saw the biggest notional drop in open interest (OI) alongside a double-digit slide in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). Notional bitcoin OI fell a record $2.4 billion (17,000 in BTC terms), driving the basis lower, according to Glassnode data. U.S. listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a massive outflow of $457.6 million. A similar outflow occurred Jan. 13, according to Farside data.

Title: Solaxy Presale Reaches $15M as New ETFs to Cause a Bull Run?

Fund manager Tuttle Capital filed applications for ten altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Among them are Chainlink ($LINK), Cardano ($ADA), and even meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Official Trump ($TRUMP). These filings come on the back of recent changes in the SEC’s leadership, as pro-crypto Mark Uyeda replaced crypto critic Gary Gensler as the agency’s chair. Tuttle Capital already offers several leveraged $BTC and $ETH ETFs. Now, the firm seeks approval for ten 2x ETFs, including $XRP, $SOL, and $MELANIA. Essentially, these are ETFs that would provide twice the daily gains or losses of their underlying tokens. Speculations about $SOL and $XRP ETFs have been spreading for a while, but meme coin ETFs are an entirely new, experimental concept. Last week, REX Shares also filed for a $DOGE ETF – perhaps viewing it as a more predictable and sustainable investment than $TRUMP or $MELANIA. Bloomberg Intelligence suggests issuers are testing the waters to see what the new SEC administration would allow. The question is – where will regulators draw the line? If the SEC approves Tuttle Capital’s ETFs, they could be available on the market by April. However, utility-backed meme coins have higher odds of getting the green light. One such project is Solaxy ($SOLX), a Solana Layer-2 solution with a Pepe mascot. Solaxy aims to prevent network congestion, reduce fees, and speed up transfers by offloading part of transactions to its side chain. There are currently no Layer-2 networks for Solana, so Solaxy pioneers the niche. This unique utility helped Solaxy gain momentum and raise over $15.6M on presale. One $SOLX now costs $0.001618, which is the lowest possible entry point into the project. It’s true that exchange listings typically boost token value, and Solaxy already has them planned. But if (or when) $SOLX ETF rolls out, we might see a truly meteoric rise. Take $BTC, for example. The first spot $BTC ETF application was filed in 2013, but only in 2021 was the first $BTC ETF launched in Canada. Within one month after the news, $BTC rose from $33K to $57K and within two to $60K. When BlackRock filed for the first US $BTC ETF in June 2023, $BTC was trading at $27K. Since $BTC ETFs began trading on the US spot market in January 2024, it hit $100K. It appears that Solaxy launches just in time for a new wave of institutional adoption, which could bring its early supporters amplified returns. The effects of the new pro-crypto administration are already evident. While the SEC hasn’t yet approved Tuttle Capital’s applications, it hasn’t turned them down either, so the odds are high. The crypto market may be entering a new bull cycle where institutional investors finally judge projects like Solaxy for their technology rather than meme facade. However, we remind you that the crypto market is extremely volatile, and no gains are guaranteed. DYOR and keep a cool head at all times. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Buys Another $1,000,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin in a Week To Control 2.7% of BTC Supply

Time Published: 2025-01-28T10:15:47Z

New data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock piled up another $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) last week. Arkham says that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – now controls 2.7% of all Bitcoin supply with its latest 10-figure BTC purchase. At time of writing, BlackRock owns 572,616 BTC worth $58.43 billion. Other notable digital assets in BlackRock’s portfolio include $3.75 billion worth of top altcoin Ethereum (ETH) and $72.02 million worth of the stablecoin USDC. Amid the asset management firm’s buying spree last week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Bitcoin could soar to as high as $700,000 per BTC during the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland. According to Fink, Bitcoin could see drastically higher prices if sovereign wealth funds begin accumulating the flagship digital asset as a hedge against “local fears” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

AI is no longer just a buzzword in retail. It’s a tool retailers are increasingly deploying to transform their business operations. Major retailers are partnering with tech giants such as Google, Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia as they explore AI’s potential. At least at the moment, the technology’s biggest impact is being felt on the supply side, not the point-of-sale. Carrie Tharp, Google Cloud’s vice president of global solutions and industries, said this month that AI’s evolution, particularly its shift from text-based applications to multi-modal tools that process images and videos, can increasingly boost retailers’ bottom lines. “What this looks like for businesses is brand new experiences,” she said at the National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail’s Big Show in New York. AI-driven marketing will gather deeper insights into consumer behavior to enhance personalization, Tharp said. But the real value, she said, is in improving internal processes. Take Home Depot (HD). The home improvement giant has tested pilot projects to create hyper-personalized experiences for customers. While there are customer-facing benefits, the focus remains largely operational. AI is streamlining operations and optimizing Home Depot’s supply chain — which ultimately leads to better experiences for customers, whether or not they see it. Tharp emphasized the importance of equipping store associates and corporate teams with AI tools to drive efficiency. AI is enhancing speed and reducing human error by automating routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on more critical decisions. AI’s growing value to retailers was evident during discussions at this month’s NRF Big Show. Companies are eager to optimize their core operations — meaning that’s where they’re most willing to spend money on AI. Tharp highlighted how Google’s (GOOGL) AI products are being integrated into the retail journey behind-the-scenes. Google’s advancements in search and consumer metrics allow retailers to track up to 10 touch points, or the interactions a customer makes with an item or product before they make a purchase decision. With AI-powered systems, retailers can predict what products will be in demand before they go out of stock “This has important implications for supply chain optimization and demand forecasting, two areas where AI capabilities can be especially useful,” Tharp said. Quantum AI is expected to take retail to even greater heights — although Tharp stressed the importance of mastering basic AI use cases first. “The priority is not only to enhance customer experiences,” she said, “but also make back-end operations more nimble and responsive to changing market conditions.” Fast food chains and discount retailers are also catching on. Greg Fiddes, Google’s director of Chrome enterprise software partnerships, shared at NRF’s Big Show how Chrome OS, a cloud-based operating system, is being used to streamline in-store operations at pizza giant Domino’s — a chain that touted using AI to make pizzas “before people ordered them” last year. Chrome OS now essentially runs interactive kiosks and digital signage across Domino’s more than 6,700 U.S. locations. Fiddes also noted the security AI provides. The software has never experienced a ransomware attack such as the one seen by CrowdStrike last year. This is crucial during peak times such as Super Bowl Sunday , when Domino’s delivers up to two million pizzas. “If you don’t make, take or bake the pizzas, you support those who do,” Michael Crumley, Domino’s manager of store technology, said of TK. “The ability to remotely manage and support devices is a major benefit, especially for a large retail chain with multiple locations.” Other big food chains such as Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s are using some form of AI, all with the goal of feeding customers faster. Retail giant Costco also relies on Chrome OS to manage operations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) is using AI and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology to streamline operations. This is especially helpful in rural areas where connectivity can be challenging. The move could help Dollar Tree better handle operations as it considers a sale of its Family Dollar brand. Retailers are already using AI autopilot systems — in which AI handles routine tasks and humans intervene only in critical situations — said Andrew Sun, who heads Nvidia’s (NVDA) AI for retail division. “No one ever feels like you have enough time to do the very manual work, moving a box off a truck, making sure it’s unpacked, getting it onto the shelf at the right price, and serving the customer,” Sun said, noting that the shift could simplify a hard job in a high turnover industry. The AI chip maker is moving beyond gaming and entertainment to look at how AI can make more efficient use of labor and reduce human error – two key factors that can make or break a supply chain. The real win for the retail industry might not be in delivering more sophisticated customer experiences, but in building a stronger, more resilient infrastructure. For now, AI’s on the supply side, but as the tech matures, it will seep more substantially into every customer interaction and companies lagging behind in AI adoption may be in for a rude awakening. “While companies are making strides, the majority are still medium to slow followers in AI adoption,” said Jerry Sheldon, vice president at global research firm IHL Services. “This gap could lead to significant competitive advantages for early adopters and heavy investors.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple earnings are coming. Here's what to expect

Apple (AAPL-0.60%) is expected to release its fiscal first quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. The company’s shares were up by 3.25% at the market close on Monday, while it reclaimed its title as the most valuable public company in the world from chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-5.19%), which suffered from the global tech sell-off sparked by China’s DeepSeek. The iPhone maker is expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter — an increase of more than 3% from the previous year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.38%). Apple is also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion. Earlier this month, Jefferies (JEF+1.13%) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform,” citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” The company rolled out its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, in October, which “has yet to gain traction with consumers,” Jefferies analysts said. Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities. However, the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the older iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro both have three cameras. This potentially makes them more attractive options, especially if they have a lower price tag, Jefferies said. Shipments of the iPhone were also down by 4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, Jefferies noted, citing data from the International Data Corporation. The firm cut iPhone shipment growth expectations. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Streamlined $MIND AI Presale to 100x as DeepSeek Beats the Big Boys of AI

The launch of DeepSeek V3 has sent shockwaves through the US stock and crypto markets. Word that the AI model built by Chinese startup DeepSeek is superior to its American counterparts has made the US markets and AI industry see red. Not only is DeepSeek the most resource-efficient AI model the world has seen, but it outperforms the likes of ChatGPT 4o, Claude, and Llama. And that isn’t even the most scary part. DeepSeek offers superior results at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. While OpenAI has been raising $18B with the goal of plowing it into massive data centers and other infrastructure, DeepSeek has built a super-efficient model for a mere $5.5M. This single move has shattered the myth that AI is a capital-intensive domain reserved for the big players. Investors are worried that DeepSeek’s cost-effective model could disrupt the current AI landscape, leading to increased competitive pressure on established players. This has resulted in a negative sentiment towards tech stocks and cryptos, particularly those heavily invested in AI. As a case in point, AI leader Nvidia was the worst-hit company on NASDAQ yesterday. Its shares fell by 17%, the worst one-day fall to date. This wiped off $593B in the company’s market cap, the highest capitalization loss ever for a Wall Street company. AI crypto tokens also experienced the impact of the DeepSeek saga. The AI category on Coingecko is down 6% in the last 24 hours, with AI agent coins losing 11% and AI agent launchpads losing 24.6%. After a hit like this, it’s going to take some real self-reflection to get the AI agent market back on track. Moving ahead, it’s possible that only tokens with a notably streamlined and elegant approach will attract investment. Cue MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that monitors, participates in, and propels meme coin discussions and interactions on various social media platforms. Through listening, collaborating, and learning, it forms its own conclusions and delivers real-time actionable insights for $MIND token holders. The $MIND AI agent comes as the answer to the information overload in the crypto space, which makes it difficult for the average investor to identify the best assets to invest in. $MIND – a self-evolving AI agent, solves this through hive-mind analysis. $MIND is a streamlined AI token project that provides token holders with early access to insights, opportunities, and trends. The $MIND presale is currently live and has already raised $4.1M so far. You can buy the token from the official presale website for just $0.0032144 right now. However, the next price increase is set to take place in less than 2 days, meaning this may be the lowest price you’ll ever get $MIND for. Moreover, since it’s still early days for the presale, investors can choose to stake their holdings and earn a sizable reward of 537% APY. The developers have reserved 15% for staking rewards. 20% of the token supply has been kept aside for marketing, which is going into building a strong community of $MIND holders. The project already has around 14K followers on X and an active Telegram community. Another 10% of the supply is reserved for listing and 30% for long-term project development. All in all, this is sound tokenomics. The $MIND presale has attracted a lot of investors (both retail and whales), and if it proves AI agents can be lean, mean, and profitable machines, could turn out to be the next 100x meme coin. Interested? All you need to do to buy $MIND is head over to MIND of Pepe’s official presale website, connect your crypto wallet, and buy the number of tokens you want. Ensure you have enough funds for gas fees, though. If you need further assistance, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $MIND. However, since crypto markets are at a dicey junction, it’s important to do your own research before investing. This article should not be weighed as investment advice, and you should always consult your own financial advisor before jumping into the crypto market.

Title: DeepSeek breakthrough, Nvidia stock rout raise concerns over need for huge AI spending

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. DeepSeek, a little-known Chinese start-up whose affordable technology matches the likes of the most formidable American tech titans such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms, has raised investor concerns over the necessity of pouring billions of dollars into research and development. The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company released its open-source reasoning model, R1, earlier this month. The model's capabilities roughly match those of advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google while having significantly lower training costs. "The impressive performance/cost dynamics have raised investor concerns about the necessity of the billions of dollars of capital expenditures by large US tech companies and the billions more they are planning to spend on generative AI in the coming years," said Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst from Morningstar. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Large US tech companies may follow suit and replicate some of the AI training techniques that DeepSeek leveraged to drive the cost of R1 down, he said in a research note on Tuesday. When DeepSeek launched, it quickly became the most downloaded app in Apple's US AppStore. The better-than-expected performance of DeepSeek led to a sell-off of Nvidia and tech peers on Wall Street on Monday. Its shares plunged 17 per cent to US$118.58, erasing almost US$600 billion of market value. Nvidia's logo and a decreasing stock graph are seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025. Photo: Reuters alt=Nvidia's logo and a decreasing stock graph are seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025. Photo: Reuters> "This was bound to happen, and it could have come from anywhere," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at French investment bank Natixis. "It came from China, all the more so, in a way, to see a correction." Wei Sun, principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, said the Nvidia sell-off reflects shifting perceptions in AI development. "DeepSeek's success challenges the belief that larger models and more computing power drive better performance, posing a threat to Nvidia's GPU-driven growth strategy," Sun said. "It also questions the need for massive investments like the US$500 billion Stargate Project. By achieving cutting-edge results with fewer resources, DeepSeek highlights the potential of efficient innovation over sheer scale, marking a turning point in the AI race." While the correction may have been an initial reaction to the hype around DeepSeek, Garcia-Herrero said she does not believe it would be a permanent correction. "The US is going to double down on investment in AI," she said. "There will be more money in the US for the AI industry, if not more than before. Because [previously] it was kind of the understanding that China was falling behind, especially in Gen AI and now we see that was not the case." US President Donald Trump has called DeepSeek's strong showing a "wake-up call" and "positive" for America's tech sector. He also warned that he would slap tariffs on foreign-made semiconductors, including chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC, if they do not start producing them stateside. Despite DeepSeek not having access to leading AI accelerators, such as Nvidia's best Hopper and Blackwell products, its large-language model (LLM) is believed to be on par with some of the best models released by OpenAI and others. "DeepSeek raises concerns that future LLMs will be developed with fewer AI GPUs from Nvidia, lower capital expenditure from hyperscalers, and perhaps less of a need for a massive energy buildout in the US," said Brian Colello, strategist at Morningstar. Nvidia on Monday responded to the hype generated by the Chinese AI firm and said its advances show the usefulness of its chips for the Chinese market and that more of its chips would be needed in the future to meet demand for DeepSeek's services. DeepSeek claims to have trained its model on only 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs over a two-month period, which at US$2 per hour explains the US$5 million headline number announced. This is driving a reassessment of AI investment strategies, focusing attention on the sustainability of AI capital expenditures, the AI competitive landscape, and the monetisation of AI, according to Richard Clode, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. DeepSeek is charging significantly less than OpenAI to use its models - about 20-40 times lower- according to Janus Henderson. This adds to concern about AI monetisation, given the extraordinary amounts of capital outlay deployed in the West. Last year, OpenAI said it closed a long-awaited funding round at a valuation of US$157 billion, including the US$6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies, including Microsoft and Nvidia. Analysts say that DeepSeek shows a Chinese company can compete with the best-of-breed AI companies in the US, despite the current restrictions on Chinese access to advanced US semiconductor technology. "The breakthrough could be that DeepSeek can achieve a state-of-the-art model without state-of-the-art equipment," according to analysts at ING. According to ING, the market needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.

The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) fell 33.78% overnight. The Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) and T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) plunged 33.8% and 33.77% respectively. All three funds reported their largest loss in a single day, according to data from FactSet. Conversely, funds betting against Nvidia like the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) rose more than 33%. "This sell-off has been a difficult lesson for investors who have seen Nvidia as invincible and have taken aggressive bets on its growth without understanding the risks of single stock ETFs," said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The funds were designed to deliver twice the performance of Nvidia on a single-day basis. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which boasts the largest assets under management out of the three, saw AUM decline by $2.4 billion from its peak last November to $4.3 billion as of Monday, according to data provided by by Global X ETFS. The AUMs of T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) are currently hovering around $419 million and $497 million, respectively. "While these ETFs can magnify gains, they can also magnify losses and may not be appropriate for investors without a high risk tolerance," Islam told CNBC. Since their approval in 2022, single-stock ETFs have seen an explosion in popularity, with over 60 products available in the U.S. worth $18 billion in assets, data from Global X ETFs showed. Single-stock ETFs strive to deliver amplified returns compared to the underlying asset. "In other words, they're more volatile," said Morningstar. "It could be a matter of time before some of them implode depending on the intensity of market movements of individual stocks," said Marc Jocum, product and investment strategist at Global X ETFs. Nvidia lost almost $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in the U.S. The sell-off was triggered by fears of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek intensifying AI competition and calling into question America's dominance in the sector. Last week, DeepSeek launched R1, an open-source reasoning model that was claimed to have taken only two months and less than $6 million to build. It was reported that DeepSeek's reasoning model outperformed Open AI's latest o1 model in several third-party tests. Single-stock ETFs come with a huge risk, however, they can be useful trading tools when employed correctly, in particular for speculators, market watchers told CNBC. These ETFs are best suited for traders who want to take advantage of volatility to express a strong bullish or bearish view over a single day, said Islam. "While they're powerful tools for tactical day traders, they may not suit buy-and-hold long-term investors," warned Jocum. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 experts

Time Published: 2025-01-28T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Do you have $10,000 burning a hole in your pocket? If you're looking to invest it, you've come to the right place. Investing can be tricky. How much should you allocate to stocks and bonds? What if you need the money in five years? When should you come into the market if stocks are in the middle of a volatile period, like they seem to have entered on Monday? Ultimately, everyone has different goals and needs with their money, and deciding where to put it calls for individualized plans that account for timelines and how much potential losses one can stomach. If you're looking for ideas, we've got you covered. In recent weeks, we asked six experts where investors sitting on a chunk of money should consider putting their cash for the months and years ahead. Answers, which came before Monday's stock market sell-off, varied across asset classes and timelines and are listed below. Stock market valuations are high, leading some of Wall Street's biggest names to worry that the S&P 500 is a bubble ready to pop. While Ragan recognizes valuations are elevated, he still sees opportunities for investors to put cash to work. "We're still pretty comfortable adding funds to the market," Ragan told BI. "We still like the S&P 500 and large-cap US equities." Among large-cap companies, technology stocks have pushed the market higher, which is why Ragan believes it's important to maintain a dedicated allocation to tech. "On one hand, we're saying don't get too overweight there, but I think you still want to have exposure in that sector," Ragan said of tech. However, it's important to have diversified sector exposure, and Ragan sees opportunities in communication services, healthcare, and financials. Companies in these sectors tend to have low price-to-earnings-growth ratios, meaning they're undervalued relative to their earnings growth rate. These sectors will also benefit from increased deregulation under President Donald Trump, Ragan said. Dividend stocks are also trading at attractive valuations, he added. These stocks can benefit a portfolio by providing a steady income stream. With rising yields, Ragan also sees opportunities in fixed income, particularly in short-term bonds. Don't just stick with Treasurys, though. Ragan recommends adding corporate and municipal bonds to the mix. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these areas of the market include the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD) and the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWY). On the heels of two stellar years for the stock market, Dobler said he's inclined to be a bit more defensive and cautious in the year ahead — especially if an investor is looking at a short-term time horizon. Price-multiple expansion won't come as easy, and investors are going to be looking for real earnings results, he said. Broadly speaking, that boils down to taking a three-part approach: allocating to fixed-income amid robust yields, so-called real assets as inflation stays elevated, and defensive parts of the stock market amid stretched valuations. Within the fixed-income category, Dobler likes investment-grade credit, Treasury inflation-protected securities, and municipal bonds. US money-market funds and high-yield savings accounts are also attractive options, he said. As for real assets, he said real estate, commodities, and infrastructure plays would get a boost as inflation remains sticky. And for defensive stocks, he said quality companies — those with stable and consistent earnings track records — would benefit if growth stocks start to hit trouble like they did in 2022. "The economy is slowing, financial conditions are tightening, and so it'll reward more of a defensive- and quality-focused strategy," Dobler said. Some examples of exchange-traded funds offering exposure to Dobler's ideas include the GMO US Quality ETF (QLTY), the VanEck Real Assets ETF (RAAX), and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD). Quinzel believes that US exceptionalism will drive the stock market in 2025. Stocks have posted strong earnings, the US GDP is slated to grow at 2% to 3% this year, and secular tailwinds such as AI will provide a significant boost to the economy, he said. If you're looking to grow $10,000, "you certainly want to have diversified equities, and you certainly want to be focused on the US," Quinzel told BI. In this environment, investors shouldn't feel constrained by the 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, especially if you have a long time horizon, Quinzel said. It's perfectly OK to take advantage of the robust economy and allocate 80%, or even all, of your portfolio to equities, he said. For those who want to add more stability to their portfolios through fixed income, Quinzel recommends steering clear of high-yield bonds and going for Treasurys, corporate credit, and asset-backed securities. Quinzel also echoed Ragan's suggestion that investors branch out from the Magnificent Seven. He sees plenty of opportunities to play the Trump trade, such as financials and industrials. Both of these sectors will benefit from deregulation, M&A activity, onshoring, and defense spending, which Quinzel anticipates will increase under the new administration. Quinzel is also a fan of momentum and quality investing. "One great way to start investing is by simply utilizing funds that have those traits of momentum and quality because both of those can do really well in this kind of late cycle mode that we're in," he said. Funds that provide exposure to these market areas include the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ). For those up for a more hands-on project, buying a multifamily property could be a good option, said Brian Rudderow, a real-estate investor and the CEO of HBR Colorado. While that may sound like it's outside the realm of possibility with just $10,000, Rudderow pointed to a Fannie Mae program launched in late 2023 that allows mom-and-pop investors to buy multifamily properties with just a 5% down payment. That's $10,000 for a $200,000 property. That's still relatively cheap for a multifamily property, let alone for a single-family home, in many areas around the US. But they do exist. "If you can find a lower-income city or a cheaper side of town, then you can do it with $10,000," Rudderow said. The monthly mortgage payment on a property at this price point would be around $2,500, Rudderow said. So, if you charged around $1,500 per unit, you could generate a positive cash flow of $500 a month. The stock market performed strongly in 2024, and Milan believes investors should be optimistic about its continued growth. There are plenty of opportunities for investors to put their cash to work. Industrials, financials, and energy are popular sectors for investors looking to take advantage of the Trump trade, Milan said. He also sees individual opportunities within those broad sectors. Investors should keep an eye on energy in particular. "For the first time in a number of years, there's a significant amount of value and strength in the energy sector," Milan said. If Trump's first term is any indicator of what's to come, Milan is bullish that the president's policies will be extremely beneficial for energy companies. Milan is less focused on big oil companies and more interested in natural gas. "Natural gas pipelines are showing extraordinary strength from a momentum standpoint right now," he said. His top picks include Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) and Energy Transfer (ET). Within financials, Milan is bullish on large private equity firms such as Blackstone (BX), Apollo Global Management (APO), and KKR & Co (KKR). "I think we're at the beginning stages of the next evolution within those types of firms, especially with regards to private credit," Milan said. These firms have poured a significant amount of resources into the private credit business, and Milan believes the asset class will take off in the coming years. Looking into the next 12 months, Roberts said he's increasingly leaning into the AI trade with the $2 billion portfolio he manages as infrastructure investment continues to grow. "It's coming, and it's coming fast," Roberts said. Part of that trade means investing in software and chips companies, like Twilio (TWLO), Palantir (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD), he said. Another piece of that play is in the energy companies that will provide the power to run data centers, he said. Some of his holdings include American Electric Power (AEP), Duke Energy (DUK), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and GE Vernova (GEV). But Roberts isn't blanketly bullish on AI-related stocks. Investors will start to put more of an emphasis on fundamentals, he said, and parts of the growth factor may start to get washed out in the year ahead. This may come amid a move into safer, dividend-providing stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), he said. "I think the unobvious trade is a rotation potentially from high-beta growth," Roberts said. "Dividend value has been really ignored over the last couple of years, and it's very out of favor." Jump to

Title: [EU] Honor Your Elders with Celebration During Lunar Festival
URL: https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/eu-en/24174173-honor-your-elders-with-celebration-during-lunar-festival/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Every year, the druids of Moonglade celebrate their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts…and, of course, lighting fireworks. The celebration has begun in Moonglade, and your Lunar Festival Invitation is waiting. Join in the fun by dressing up in your Lunar Festival finery, launching fireworks, and paying homage to the Elders throughout Azeroth. When: 28 January–11 February Where: Moonglade, with camps in Ironforge, Stormwind, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Dragon Isles zones, Khaz Algar zones, and the Undercity Currency: Coin of Ancestry Khaz Algar is joining in Lunar New Year festivities as eight new Elders (two per zone) make their way to the island, bringing with them a new Achievement, "Elders of Khaz Algar," and a new reward for trading in Coins of Ancestry, the Lunar Launcher. "It's always a festival when you are on the Lunar Launcher." The Lunar Festival is a time of celebration for the peoples of Azeroth. At the beginning of each year, elders of generations past manifest around the world to impart their wisdom upon all who listen. Should you encounter these venerable spirits in your travels and take the time to heed their words, they may even pass along tokens of their gratitude—Coins of Ancestry, the lessons of a past age in physical form. Gather enough Coins of Ancestry and the Cenarion Circle will open their stores of celebratory garb, fireworks, trinkets, and recipes! The Cenarion Circle has good cause to celebrate, for the Lunar Festival marks the return of many Ancients that fell in battles past: Goldrinn, Malorne, Aviana, and Cenarius himself. But this celebration is darkened by the eternal torment of one of their own—Omen, a wolf Ancient blessed by the moon goddess Elune, has risen from the depths of Moonglade’s lake. Though Omen was once as noble and proud as any Ancient, he was driven mad by the Burning Legion’s tainted magics during the War of the Ancients. Omen’s immortality means that he is forever cursed to return in his maddened state at the advent of each new year—and this year, he has grown further in power. Heroes level 20 and above must make haste to ease this tormented Ancient’s suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year he will return with a clearer mind. The great wolf Omen was once a hero of this world. An embodiment of strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the War of the Ancients until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across Azeroth, leaving death and terror in his wake. Omen was finally defeated in Moonglade, and he now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. But each year, at the beginning of the festival, he stirs... The celebration begins with an introductory quest, The Lunar Festival. The Cenarion Circle has invited all denizens of Azeroth to take part in the celebration of the Lunar Festival. You can learn more about the event by meeting with the Lunar Festival Harbinger. It wouldn’t be a celebration without fireworks. You’ll be asked to buy some Lunar Fireworks and Cluster Fireworks to launch and complete the quest Lunar Fireworks. Once you’ve proven your pyrotechnic prowess, you’ll receive your Lunar Festival Invitation to travel to Moonglade and speak with Valadar Starsong in Nighthaven. With your invitation in hand, you’ll be able to travel quickly to Moonglade by standing within Greater Moonlight throughout the holiday. The Lunar Festival features 18 achievements and one meta-achievement. It's a good time to travel Azeroth, see the sights, and pay your respects to the various Elders. Visiting an Elder will reward reputation with select capital cities, a Coin of Ancestry, some experience and gold, and a Lucky Red Envelope. *Speak with Myrael Lunarbloom in Moonglade to take the quest Lunar Preservation. You'll be tasked with visiting various moonwells around Azeroth to charge her staff. Upon completion of the quest, you'll earn 25 Coins of Ancestry which you can use to purchase one of four floral crowns (only wearable during Lunar Festival) from Valadar Starsong. Once you've purchased a crown, a new quest will become available, allowing you to earn a new version of the crown. This new crown is then added to your transmog appearances once the quest is complete allowing you to wear this crown year-round. Once all of the crowns are purchased, the associated quests become available to all characters on your account. A WoW Classic version of the Lunar Festival is also available for those seeking to honor their Elders throughout Azeroth. Look for the Lunar Festival Emissary in any capital city to kick off the celebration. When: 28 January–18 February Where: Any capital city. Fashionable Lunar Festival Emissaries are eager to help direct you to Lunar Festival Harbingers found in each capital city. Complete the Lunar Festival World Quests to earn the "To Honor One's Elders" meta-achievement as part of the "What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been" achievement. Learn more about the Lunar Festival in Wowhead's holiday guide and WoW Classic holiday guide.

Title: The bicycle industry's dirty secret

Time Published: 2025-01-28T08:29:01Z
Full Content:
Punitive labour conditions tied to cycling’s big-name brands Cycling may be green but Taiwan, the global centre of bicycle manufacturing, has built an industry on migrant labour and dodgy employment practices. We all know that cycling is healthy and virtuous; millions of Europeans burn calories instead of petrol when they hit the road on their daily trips to school and work. Globally, the bicycle market is big business, valued at $66bn in 2024. But for the workers who make our bikes in Taiwanese factories, conditions are often dirty, dangerous and demeaning. For years, debt bondage, passport retention, abusive living conditions, withheld wages, threats and intimidation have been common practice – all indicators of forced labour according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). And for years, many of the world’s biggest brands – including Bianchi, Canyon, Centurion, Giant, Merida, Pinarello, REI, Scott, Specialized and Trek – have had bikes or components made in Taiwan. Taiwan is the biggest exporter of bikes to Europe – around 40% of all bicycles imported into Europe with the Netherlands, Germany and the UK as major destinations. And many more bikes sold in Europe contain Taiwan-made components though they may be marketed under a local brand with assembly in Europe. Taiwan’s bicycle industry is clustered around Taichung, in the centre of the island, with the world’s biggest manufacturer, Giant, to its north and the second biggest, Merida, to the south. In between, there are hundreds of factories employing thousands of migrants from poorer neighbouring countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, who make components (frames, brakes, chains, gears, lights, saddles, tyres etc). The world’s largest manufacturer of bike tyres, Maxxis, has factories here too. Bikes and parts are exported worldwide from Taichung’s factories. Specialized and Centurion buy from Merida; Giant supplies Trek, Scott, and until recently REI; Bianchi, Canyon and Pinarello source from Fritz Jou among others; Cannondale and Cervélo from Kenstone Metal.

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said he would fast-track product releases and “deliver much better models” after advances by Chinese start-up DeepSeek undermined Silicon Valley’s lead in a global artificial intelligence arms race. DeepSeek’s generative AI chatbot, a direct rival to ChatGPT, is able to perform some tasks at the same level as recently released models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, despite claims it cost a fraction of the money and time to develop. The release of DeepSeek’s R1 model last week and its rise to the top of Apple’s App Store has triggered a tech stock sell-off. Asian tech shares fell on Tuesday in the wake of a Wall Street rout overnight. The Nasdaq fell 3 per cent and US chipmaker Nvidia, which produces the chips used to train large AI models, slumped 17 per cent, losing $600 billion (€570 billion) in market capitalisation. On Monday evening, Altman wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model was “impressive, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”. He added: “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” Altman, who last week announced that investors including SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion to build a network of data centres to power its AI models, added that computing resources were “more important now than ever before”. Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Oracle have earmarked $310 billion in 2025 for capital expenditure, which includes AI infrastructure, according to data compiled by Visible Alpha. Such estimates have been based on the premise that huge amounts of computing power will be needed to advance AI capabilities. But DeepSeek’s ability to compete on a fraction of the budget of OpenAI — which was recently valued at $157 billion — and rivals Anthropic, Google and Meta, has raised questions about the vast sums being poured into training systems. “The winners won’t be the ones burning the most cash,” said Aidan Gomez, founder of Toronto-based Cohere, which builds large language models for enterprises. Instead, he said, they would be those “finding efficient solutions”. The advances by DeepSeek have also exposed risks for venture capitalists who put almost $100 billion into US AI start-ups last year. “There’s now an open weight model floating around the internet which you can use to bootstrap any other sufficiently powerful base model into being an AI reasoner,” said Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, in a blog on Monday. “AI capabilities worldwide just took a one-way ratchet forward,” he added. “Kudos to DeepSeek for being so bold as to bring such a change into the world!” DeepSeek’s success has complicated the argument that massive cash piles create an unassailable advantage, which has helped leading Silicon Valley labs raise tens of billions of dollars over the past year. “If you’re Anthropic or OpenAI, attempting to be at the forefront, and someone can serve what you can at a tenth of the cost, that’s problematic,” said Mike Volpi, who led Index Ventures’ investment into Cohere. The sudden release of DeepSeek’s latest model surprised some at Meta. “The main frustration is, ‘Why didn’t we come up with this first?’ when we have thousands of the brightest minds working on this,” said one Meta employee. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg — who last week said he expected to allocate up to $65 billion in capital spending to expand AI teams and build a new data centre — has advocated for open source, positioning Meta at its forefront in the US. “We want the US to set the global AI standard, not China,” the company said in response to DeepSeek. Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said “running AI assistant services for billions” would still require large levels of computing power. Rival company insiders and investors have expressed scepticism about the low costs cited by DeepSeek in developing its models. In December, the company said its V3 model, which its app’s chatbot runs on, cost just $5.6mn to train. However, it added that this figure was only for the final training run, not the complete cycle, and excluded “the costs associated with prior research and...experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data”. DeepSeek has attributed its success — despite using inferior chips to its US competitors — to methods that allow the AI model to selectively focus on specific parts of input data as a way of reducing the costs of running the model. For its latest R1 model, it used a reinforcement learning technique, a relatively new approach to AI in which models teach themselves how to improve without human supervision. The company also used open-source models, including Alibaba’s Qwen and Meta’s Llama, to fine tune its R1 reasoning model. The technical advances and investor interest in DeepSeek’s progress could light a fire under AI companies. “In general, we expect the bias to be on improved capability, sprinting faster towards artificial general intelligence, more than reduced spending,” said research firm Rosenblatt on Monday. Researchers and investors, including Marc Andreessen, have drawn parallels between the race between the US and China on artificial general intelligence and its competition with the Soviet Union during the cold war, both in space exploration and nuclear weapons development. Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said the race to AGI was “worse”. “Even the CEOs who are engaging in the race have stated that whoever wins has a significant probability of causing human extinction in the process, because we have no idea how to control systems more intelligent than ourselves,” he said. “In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff.” - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025Sign up for the Business Today newsletter and get the latest business news and commentary in your inbox every weekday morning Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trillion-dollar disruptor: China's DeepSeek upends AI world overnight
URL: https://newatlas.com/ai-humanoids/deepseek-ai/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T07:17:00Z
Full Content:
The US AI giants got a wake-up call this week, when fledgling Chinese firm DeepSeek wiped a record-breaking trillion dollars off the value of heavyweights like Nvidia and OpenAI. The technology's gatekeepers are rattled – and they have good reason to be, as DeepSeek's model R1 shows how the costly existing roadmap is no longer the only way forward. This game-changing event is on the back of the company's latest AI model – DeepSeek-R1 – being released for use on smartphones across the globe, following desktop launch on January 10. DeepSeek has been on our radar for a few weeks, after its chatbot V3 dropped on December 26 and was reported to have performed as well as the leading US GPTs (generative pre-trained transformers) – something that few news outlets covered at the time (including us). With the AI frontrunners – all US companies – developing new features at breakneck speed, it was hard to imagine that this unheard-of large language model (LLM), even one that looked impressive on paper, and was fundamentally different in many ways, could rock the boat. But that all changed overnight on January 27, 2025 – as China woke up on the day before Lunar New Year's Eve, DeepSeek had become the #1 app in the AI/GPT world and decimated the stock price of the who's who of the industry: As well as Nvidia and OpenAi, scalps included Meta, Google's parent company Alphabet, Nvidia partners Oracle, plus many other energy and data center firms. Elon Musk dodged this bullet – only because X is no longer listed on the market. While the market downturn is no doubt a temporary one, DeepSeek has permanently altered the path of the AI timeline. Until now, the US has been so far ahead in the field that all we really expected to see were poor imitations of the 'gold standard' models. And this is why DeepSeek is so interesting, because it's forged its own path, setting up China as a new player in what some are now calling a digital arms race. What makes it so different are a number of things: It's been trained on older, cheaper chips and cut out a few of the costly steps that has, until now, been the standard route for chatbots. Because of this, its development cost a reported US$5.6 million to rent the hardware required for training the model, compared with an estimated $60 million for Llama 3.1 405B, which also used 11 times the computing resources. GPT-4 cost more than $100 million. Microsoft has also said it plans to spend $80 billion on AI development in 2025. R1 is also open source, rather than closely guarded proprietary, which in turn helps DeepSeek navigate regional restrictions. Overall, this has triggered a kind of existential crisis for the US-dominated industry – because what if a model could be produced for a fraction of the cost, and trained more efficiently, and be just as good, if not better? "There are a few things to know about this one," said Casey Newton, one of the hosts of the Hard Fork podcast on January 10. "One is that it's really big; it has more than 680 billion parameters, which makes it significantly bigger than the largest model in Meta's Llama series, which I would say up to this point has been the gold standard for open models. That one has 405 billion parameters. "But the really, really important thing about DeepSeek is that it was trained at a cost of US$5.5 million," he continued. "And so what that means is you now have an LLM that is about as good as the state-of-the-art [AIs] that was trained for a tiny fraction of what something like Llama or ChatGPT was trained for." To understand why DeepSeek is so significant, you have to look at where it came from. Its developer, quantitive – or quant – trader Liang Wenfung bought up thousands of Nvidia chips back in 2021 to work on a 'side project' to assist with his day job at the helm of one of the Chinese market's largest hedge-fund companies, High-Flyer. The 40-year-old financier used these chips to build algorithms and mathematical models to help predict market trends and steer investments, with DeepSeek only established in 2023. “When we first met him, he was this very nerdy guy with a terrible hairstyle talking about building a 10,000-chip cluster to train his own models," one of Liang’s business partners told the Financial Times. "We didn’t take him seriously. He couldn’t articulate his vision other than saying: ‘I want to build this, and it will be a game changer.’ We thought this was only possible from giants like ByteDance and Alibaba.” Less than two years on, the maker of those chips – Nvidia – would see $593 billion wiped from its market value overnight thanks to Wenfung. It's now the biggest daily loss in US market history. (Incidentally, export of advanced Nvidia chips has now been restricted – yet DeepSeek-V3 was trained on cheaper, older Nvidia H800 hardware.) What makes DeepSeek's R1 model such a game-changer is its unorthodox training (and, in turn, the money saved in the process). This fantastic explainer covers a recent research paper released by the company, which essentially details how DeepSeek bypassed the traditional supervised fine-tuning stage of LLM development and instead focused on the AI's "self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process." “We demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start," the DeepSeek researchers wrote in the January paper. "Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data." While this is unlikely to rock the world of LLM users, who are most likely casually interacting with the likes of Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude, it stands as a defining moment in the development of this technology. Which brings us to another aspect of its business model that sets it apart – and has the industry rattled: Access. As Nature's Elizabeth Gibney wrote about on January 23. DeepSeek-R1 is released as "open weight," which means it can be used as a tool for researchers to study and build on. In comparison, existing market-leading models are what researchers deem a "black box," a closed-off system controlled instead by the developers. It paves the way for scientists to harness an existing model for their own uses, rather than build from the ground up. "DeepSeek hasn’t released the full cost of training R1, but it is charging people using its interface around one-30th of what [Open AI's] o1 costs to run," Gibney noted. "The firm has also created mini ‘distilled’ versions of R1 to allow researchers with limited computing power to play with the model." However, as DeepSeek triggered the market crash on January 27, it was met with cyberattackers attempting to crash its servers. "Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service," the company posted on its status page. "Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support." As of writing, DeepSeek-R1 can still be downloaded and the site accessed, but new registrations are restricted to China residents with a local phone number. Meanwhile, a somewhat inevitable backlash is now under way, with countless news outlets including Forbes noting that DeepSeek-R1 is hampered by censorship, stonewalling questions that would evoke criticism of China. Silicon Valley startup Perplexity AI – which currently has its sights on a US merger deal with TikTok's parent company ByteDance – was briefly hosting an "uncensored" search engine powered by DeepSeek-R1, but this too has been taken offline. Regardless of how this plays out in the coming days and weeks, one thing is certain: DeepSeek, in a few short weeks, has singlehandedly shifted the course of AI development. “The emergence of DeepSeek is a significant moment in the AI revolution," said Professor Geoff Webb, from the Department of Data Science & AI at Monash University in Australia. "Until now it has seemed that billion-dollar investments and access to the latest generation of specialized Nvidia processors were prerequisites for developing state-of-the-art systems. This effectively limited control to a small number of leading US-based tech corporations. He adds that if DeepSeek's claims are all true, "it means that the US tech sector no longer has exclusive control of the AI technologies, opening them to wider competition and reducing the prices they can charge for access to and use of their systems." Webb then makes an important point that few people are talking about: The monopolization of AI by a handful of powerful players in the US – further consolidated by government-legislated export restrictions on crucial Nvidia hardware – essentially denies the rest of the world a stake in the most significant technological advancement since the internet. “Looking beyond the implications for the stock market, current AI technologies are US-centric and embody US values and culture," he added. "This new development has the potential to create more diversity through the development of new AI systems. “It also has the potential to make AI more accessible for researchers around the world both for developing new technologies and for applying them in diverse areas including healthcare.”

Feedback The job market for MBA graduates has reached a critical juncture, sparking conversations across social media and beyond. A post by CA Nitin Kaushik on X, using the handle @Finance_Bareek, captured the sentiment perfectly: “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling.” Kaushik’s post resonates with a growing number of MBA aspirants and professionals grappling with the changing realities of the job market. The issue isn’t confined to India; even graduates from elite institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton are feeling the squeeze. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees: ₹25,00,000 ROI: Uncertain Research before enrolling. 🎓💡#stockmarketcrash #niftycrash #financetips #investingbehaviour The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 MBA graduates were jobless three months after graduation. This number has more than doubled since 2022 when it stood at 10%. Other top-tier schools like Stanford and Wharton have seen similar dips, with unemployment rates hovering around 20%. The issue isn’t just limited to the US. According to the International Labor Organisation’s Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024, 13% of the global youth labour force was unemployed in 2023—a figure representing nearly 65 million people. Why are MBAs struggling? Despite boasting median starting salaries exceeding $175,000, MBA graduates are finding it harder to land jobs due to shifting hiring practices. Consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG, alongside tech giants such as Google and Amazon, have drastically reduced MBA hires amid widespread layoffs and economic slowdowns. Post-pandemic structural changes have also left companies preferring smaller, highly skilled teams. The rise of AI and automation further compounds the issue, making generalist MBA degrees less appealing compared to targeted certifications and boot camps. Kristen Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development at Harvard Business School, put it bluntly: “Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator.” Instead, companies are now focusing on technical and specialized skills. How MBA Education Needs to Evolve To address these challenges, institutions are pivoting toward innovative solutions. Harvard is testing an AI tool to match graduates with jobs and suggest courses to bridge skill gaps. Some graduates have found success by lowering their expectations and opting for less conventional roles, according to Forbes. One thing is clear—degrees alone won’t cut it anymore. The future belongs to professionals who continuously upskill to meet the ever-changing demands of the workforce. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: How Communism Is Outcompeting Capitalism

I asked DeepSeek for a rec on Chinese art and it suggested Along the River During the Qingming Festival. This is a 1736 version by Chen Mei, Sun Hu. Jin Kun, Dai Hong, and Cheng Zhidao. Set to Jasmine Flower. Isn't it ironic? Don't ya think? A hundred EV companies have bloomed under communism, while capitalism subsidizes one blowhard making four vehicles and one paperweight. A startup has trained an AI for $5.5 million under communism, while capitalist AI requires $500 billion in government support. Everything capitalists told you about capitalism was just some bullshit to sell you more capitalism. Communism is actually far more innovative than capitalism. They do more with less, and for better purpose. The great technical power of communism was actually known from the jump. Russia and China industrialized within one generation. No nations ever developed faster or more, an economic miracle pointedly ignored by most western economists because communism bad, STFU. The productive capacity of communism was discredited because the whole thing seemed to fall with the end of the Soviet Union, but that wasn't all. As Xi Jinping said in 2018, Luckily for the world, China was decoupling its model from the Soviet model before the Soviets fell and evolved something quite different (and more robust). As Xue Muqiao said at a World Bank conference in 1982 (all of this via How China Escaped Shock Therapy, Isabella M. Weber, read it, it's excellent), The chief Chinese insight was that the problem required Chinese insight. Chinese communism was branded socialism with Chinese characteristics and with this highly experimental and adaptive economic system, Deng Xiaoping took China to market (without selling off the whole hog). Uncle Deng predicted the trajectory quite presciently in 1987 (in People's Daily): If anything, Uncle Deng was being conservative. We're only a quarter through the new century and China already has higher life expectancy and living standards than capitalist America. The only thing America leads on is GDP, which measures its corruption, debt, healthfraud, and constant self-stimulation as positives (which they are not). In real economic terms like PPP, China already tops America, and it doesn't prioritize such blunt (dick) measures itself, preferring to look for ‘high quality’ growth than just making abstract numbers go up. As you can see, Chinese socialism is pragmatic more than programmatic. As Deng said in a 1962 speech (which pissed Mao off), China, of course, had to lay a Maoist foundation to industrialize in the first place, but what to do with that industrial base was the problem in the 1990s. Many post-communist countries threw themselves on the tender mercies of capitalism (feeding socialism to the market) and saw the steepest declines in quality of life outside of wartime. China had a different idea which was markets within socialism. Why not? As Uncle Deng said in 1984, Indeed, people have had markets under every type of economic system, The Market™ is not something unique to capitalism, that's just marketing. As Jiang Zemin described socialism with Chinese characteristics in 1992, This is all the historical background that leads to the situation we see now, where Chinese socialism clearly outcompetes western capitalism, as Uncle Deng foresaw. So we're at the point where the modern General Secretary can look back and take a bit of a victory lap. China's success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just look. Take cars, for example, the most obvious vehicle for conveying national power. The Tesla was an innovation when it started, but now they're just releasing four models and some toy-trucks that brick if you wash them. It's honestly dystopian if you want to buy a pure EV from a pure EV company in America. You can buy an S, X, or Y, or barely usable Cybertruck. Meanwhile in China, BYD alone sells over 40 models, and there are hundreds of what they call NEV companies, engaged in ruthless competition. China, the communist country, preserves the rational spirit of capitalism while America, the capitalist country, subsidizes one clown car. WTF is going on? It's almost as if the propaganda were bullshit and communism actually works. The core difference between communism and capitalism is not what (there are markets under communism and state-intervention under capitalism) but for whom. Cui bono? The names communism and capitalism tell you all you need to know. Under communism the community is most important whereas under capitalism it's capital. The difference between communism and capitalism is not that hard to understand, etymology is enough. Democracy™ and Human Rights© are just marketing taglines capitalism uses to obscure the obvious, that it's rule by capital above all. The problem is that capital is not actually very good at allocating capital. As Biggie said, one should never get high on one's own supply, which American capitalism has been doing since the massive deregulation of the 1980s, which is now uniparty policy (Congress is just an insider trading club now). Stock buybacks, bullshit valuations, pump and dumps so big the government bails you out. The core question, as always is for whom? Communism allocates resources for some common purpose (socialism for the social purpose) or Islam for God (who is surely the best planner); many economic systems are possible depending on ‘for whom’. Capitalism is marketed as some all-purpose solution for general good, but it's not, it's just for increasing capital, as it says on the tin. Capitalism is not a system for governance so much as a system for dismantling governance for its own metabolic needs. In short, a cancer. Communism (or any -ism that isn't centered around money) is capable of allocating capital for a different purpose beyond just reproducing capital. Like reproducing humans and (theoretically) reproducing nature and not killing us all. There are many different directions possible if you direct your economy towards something rather than just ‘growing your economy’. That is circular logic which divides by zero at some point. You cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet. Communist industrialization, of course, leads to the heat death of life on earth as much as capitalist industrialization, but there is at least the concept of a shared community which might include all living beings, rather than share capital above all things (I'm musing purely theoretically here). If communist liberation movements (there has never been a Capitalist Liberation Front) had not been brutally suppressed across the world last century, we might have had a fighting chance to stop climate collapse and resource exhaustion by the 1970s, when it was possible. There is at least the theoretical concept of a brake within communism, whereas under capitalism it's all accelerator. This is the core reason communism makes better cars and artificial incarnations today. China produces cheap, functional EVs and not luxury virtue signalling devices. China produces cheap, efficient AI and not luxury investment vehicles. Communism has a reason behind production while capitalism is just irrational growth for growth's sake (ie, cancer). None of this will save the world (it's too late) but we can at least say ‘I knew it’ to machines that don't care while we're tooling along the highway (to hell). Now take AI, another vehicle for conveying national power (which also destroys the natural world). Conversational AI was last place where western capitalism could be said to work. AI was like the quarterback of the tech industry, the last place a white man could lead. But now that lead has been obliterated by DeepSeek. At the same time the US government was announcing a $500 billion oligarchy investment in OpenAI, DeepSeek released a comparable model that had been trained on $5.5 million. Under communism a private entrepreneur came up with DeepSeek out of pocket, while under capitalism the President had to stand next to Sam Altman, holding his hand. What's going on here? The problem again is that capital is not very good at allocating capital. It will just give the money to itself. This is another digression, but at a very high level, Jamie Merchant describes how, “Traditionally, some form of planned economy is taken to be the alternative to market institutions, but there is not much planning happening here. Rather, this is something new: the abolition of the market without planning.” What Merchant means by the ‘abolition of the market’ is important. America effectively arrived on central planning without planning. A cartel of banks just moves interest rates around, and the government gives them free money to do it. It's all centrally controlled, but without a brainwave among them. As Merchant continues, What Merchant is describing is the fact that America in 2008 bailed out the big banks without taking equity stakes (ie nationalizing them). It did the same thing to the big car companies. The market said these companies were dead but the US government just said no and kept them going. The ‘creative destruction’ of the market was abolished, ie the market was abolished without planning. The US government was just reacting to crises, but ended up creating a conundrum that they can't get out of. Their whole economy is a giant Ponzi scheme and there is no reverse Ponzi. In this oligarchic system, the only purpose is make line go up, to keep the high going as long as possible. In that sense, having a product that works well and cheaply is actually a terrible comedown. It lowers profits (which are increasingly irrelevant) and worst of all lowers spending. As Merchant continues, “The asset management firms Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street Advisors are the largest single shareholders in 9 out of 10 companies on the S&P 500, on average owning more than 20 percent of the shares of every company on the index, so it is naturally in their interest to discourage any competition that could lower profits.” In this capitalist context, what is the purpose of a $5.5 million AI system? What is its value to those for whom the opening bell tolls? Why would any capitalist want such a thing when we've got this $500 billion hustle going on? Offering cheaper, more efficient anything to bankers is like offering them a hand towel in the nightclub bathroom. That's not what they're in there for. At work or play, they're trying to make that line go up as fast and furiously as possible. As Matthew McConaughey says in Wolf Of Wall Street: AI was the golden goose that VR was supposed to be, it made NVIDIA's line go up and the ‘magnificent seven’ crowded into the bathroom stall to get high AF. The more GPUs (and energy and water) these products consumed the better. AI was a magical product with frankly mythical benefits that had people lining up to throw money at it. That was the value of AI in the capitalist system, not AI itself. Again, remember that capitalism perceives no human need but greed. It doesn't care what the product does, how much energy and water it burns, as long as it makes line go up, be it in the nose or news. But now in China they're facing a ‘competitor’ (everyone besides America is happy to work together) that upends their main hustle with a side project. DeepSeek was a side-project of some financial quants (algorithmic traders) with a dream and some spare GPU capacity. Conversational AI is a side-side-project in China which has a real economy building real things, and where AI is primarily used for boring business cases, not idle chatting. And so DeepSeek is released open-weight (effectively open-source) because they don't give a shit. As DeepSeek's CEO said, OpenAI is just a branding term, but DeepSeek is actually doing it. Nobody's trying (or able) to become some rentier oligarch in China, they already collectively own the means of production through the Communist Party. People can certainly get rich, but China's target is ‘moderate prosperity’ and ‘high-quality growth,’ not fuck-off money and growth at all costs. This leads to very different products. It's actually a completely different culture. As Alanis Morissette said, isn't it ironic, don't you think? Capitalism was supposed to be this great engine of ingenuity, but it's congealed into monopolization, corruption, massive waste, and pump and dumps. Communism was tarred as the death of individual initiative, but they've got hedge fund guys doing game-changing AI as side projects. Note that I don't mean conversational AI itself is game-changing, I mean that DeepSeek exposes the shell game American AI companies (and chip-makers) were playing. I haven't even gotten into how China outcompeted America on social media and basically every domain they care about, and the domains they don't care about, like, health, housing, education, and actual human needs. If you read even thinly into the history of these economic systems, it's not that hard to explain. Communism has a purpose beyond profit and the economy can be directed for some human (or ideally natural) purpose. Capitalism has no purpose beyond profit, and just degenerates into fraud. These systems are not the same. Capitalism is worse.

Title: Analysis:US tech stock tumble highlights risk of market reliance on megacaps

Business Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., December 10, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo NEW YORK : Turbulence in some of the biggest tech names is reminding investors of one of the major risks to the U.S. stock market's record-setting rally: Reliance on a handful of mammoth companies to power those gains. Investors are scrambling to understand the fallout for the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme that has been a critical driver for stocks over the past two years after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model rattled markets. Optimism over AI has helped propel shares of chipmaker Nvidia and others of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps, which combined contributed more than half of the S&P 500's 25 per cent total return in 2024. Because of those gains, the Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the weight of the benchmark S&P 500 and about 45 per cent of the Nasdaq 100 - meaning when they falter they have outsized impact on the closely followed market barometers. "You run the risk when you have concentration that you have selloffs like this," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. "It's certainly going to raise questions in terms of how investors are positioning portfolios." The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Monday after news of the DeepSeek AI model - cutting the index's year-to-date gain nearly by half - while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 sank 3 per cent. While it is uncertain "how big a threat DeepSeek itself will be to the AI theme," said Phillip Wool, chief research officer and lead portfolio manager at Rayliant Global Advisors, "it's crystal-clear that there are a bunch of correlated and crowded trades at risk when the tide of sentiment turns." Shares of Nvidia, the AI poster child whose stunning stock-price rise had propelled it to become the largest company by market value, tumbled 17 per cent on Monday. Seth Hickle, managing partner at Mindset Wealth Management, said he moved to position more defensively with Nvidia options amid the volatility following the DeepSeek news. Nvidia "is really widely held," Hickle said. "So this really affects all Americans who have a retirement portfolio or a passive equity investment strategy." Just last week President Donald Trump's announcement of private sector investment in AI infrastructure gave a lift to tech stocks and the broader market. Analysts at Capital Economics said that if it became clear that AI models could indeed be trained effectively with less high-end computing power than had previously been assumed, "there would clearly be a risk of a further correction in the U.S. stock market." "That’s because this would potentially undermine the dominant positions of some firms that have powered the rally," the Capital Economics analysts said in a note. INFLECTION POINT? Investing in broad market funds that follow the S&P 500 has been a winning bet for the past two years, with the benchmark index posting back-to-back annual gains of over 20 per cent. Many actively managed funds have been underweight the major tech stocks, which was a headwind for the funds' performance. But the increasing megacap stock concentration in the benchmarks "means that we cannot all be very passively invested as we have been over the last decade," said Shams Afzal, managing director and portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel. Some corners of tech were benefiting on Monday as investors assessed the DeepSeek implications, with shares of cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks and software company ServiceNow both up about 1 per cent. The DeepSeek news "could lead to some relative leadership shift, which could be other parts of tech, as opposed to just Nvidia," said Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Horizon's Carlson and others wondered if Monday's AI developments could be an "inflection point" that prompts a change in market leadership or a rotation into other corners of the U.S. market that have not fared as well in recent years. To be sure, many market participants said the stock selloff could be an overreaction as investors "shoot first and ask questions later" as they sort out the DeepSeek developments. Josh Pantony, co-founder and CEO of Boosted.ai, a firm that advises asset managers on how to deploy AI, said he is adding AI-related stocks to his personal portfolio “right, left and center” in the wake of the selloff. The market will be further tested by a slew of quarterly results this week, including from Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Tesla - four of the Magnificent Seven. David Wagner, head of equities and portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, said the megacap companies exhibit operating leverage, which can continue to drive operating margin expansion. "No matter how you slice it, the U.S. market is dependent on these stocks, but that's not always a bad thing," Wagner said.

(Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Even if you don't pay much attention to the stock market, chances are you've heard about Nvidia and its share price today. The company broke the record for the biggest one-day loss in value for a company on the US stock market. Nvidia's share price dropped by 17 per cent. This equated to a huge $US593 billion ($948 billion) loss in value — that's nearly $1 trillion in Australian currency. Here's what you need to know about the company everyone's taking about. Nvidia is a technology company that makes chips, systems and software that power things like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and graphics. It was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993. At the time, the aim was to "bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets". In 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256, the world's first dedicated PC graphics processing unit (GPU). Nvidia, which goes by the a four-letter code NVDA on the stock market, became the world's most valuable company in June last year. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing. Nvidia suffered a blow in September, when share prices dropped by 9.5 per cent — at the time, it was the deepest ever single-day decline in market value for a US company. That was until Monday, when Nvidia broke its own record. Nvidia invented the graphics processing unit, or GPU. (Reuters: Robert Galbraith) As of the close of trade on the US stock market on January 27, it was $US118.42. Compare that to just a few weeks ago on January 6, when it was $US149.43 — its highest ever closing price. When you look at the share price across three months, you'll see it's a pretty significant dip: You can see the price taking a dive at the far right side of the graph. (Supplied: Nvidia) Because of the success of an AI chatbot called DeepSeek that creators claim only used cheaper versions of Nvidia chips. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 and touted its chatbot as being just as good as ChatGPT — but free. DeepSeek's AI assistant — a direct competitor to ChatGPT — has become the number one downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. Last week, a research paper was published about DeepSeek's new model called R1 that said it had advanced "reasoning" skills. The kicker was that this model was supposedly created using an earlier, less advanced versions of Nvidia chips. While this claim has been disputed, it still made people wonder how much of a threat this would pose to Nvidia. That's because the paper claimed DeepSeek only spent $US6 million to make it, which is really, really cheap compared to what other AI companies spend. For context, analysts estimate that big US companies will spend $US250 billion this year on AI infrastructure. So this lead people to question if Nvidia would keep making as much money as it had been. This set the wheels in motion for panic among investors, but it wasn't until DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple's app store on Monday that things really took off. Investors started selling their shares and, by the time the US stock market closed, close to $US600 billion had been wiped off the company's market capitalisation or "market cap" — which is the total value of a public company's stock currently held by all its shareholders. At closing, the price of one Nvidia share was $US24.20, or 17 per cent, lower. DeepSeek's success spooked investors. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic) Obviously losing nearly $US600 billion isn't ideal for any company. But it's worth noting that the stock price for the company is still pretty high. Have a look at this chart, showing the growth of Nvidia's share prices across the past year: The stock price is about double what it was this time last year. (Supplied: Nvidia) You'll see that, even with Monday's losses, it's still worth more than it was last January. On January 29 last year, it was only worth $US62.47 — a little more than half of what it's worth today. And now look at its growth since 2013: Nvidia's stock prices skyrocketed from 2023 — and it is still significantly higher than it was even when you take Monday's losses into account. (Supplied: Nvidia) Nvidia was worth just $US14.32 at the start of 2023, so it's still up by more than 700 per cent in less than two years. It has added more than $US100 to its share price in that time. ABC North America correspondent Carrington Clarke suggests we could be in for a waiting game to see how this pans out for Nvidia. "Often we see in markets when new information is being divested, the immediate concern is perhaps panic," he says. "The concern [is] that lofty expectations about future profits were not based on firm ground. "We [will] wait to see how this is processed. "Nvidia has a history of seeing major sell-offs and then rising again." Take, for example, the September drop — share prices got down to $US102.83 at its lowest point on September 6. A month later, the price had gone up to $US124.92.

Title: Asia shares are mixed after a US tech selloff as a Chinese rival joins the global AI frenzy

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 27, 2025 at 10:50 PM Updated: January 28, 2025 at 5:31 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Rebounding tech stocks drove U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to claw back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% after sliding 3.1 % the day before. Recommended Videos The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% the day before, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost a quarter of its value, 25.7%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. All told, the S&P 500 rose 55.42 points to 6,067.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136.77 to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 391.75 to 19,733.59. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.53%, where it was late Monday. It’s been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn’t as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji’s stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Without public input, LA mayor Karen Bass decides to hire ‘outside consultant’ to rebuild the Palisades

Without public input, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass went and appointed a “Chief Recovery Officer” to oversee the post-fire rebuilding process—Steve Soboroff has been largely absent, but no doubt collecting a nice little salary. Now, again without public input, Bass intends to hire an “outside consultant” to rebuild the Palisades. Here’s the story, from an article at the Los Angeles Times: The city of Los Angeles is planning to hire an outside consultant to handle a significant rebuilding contract for areas devastated by this month’s Palisades fire, Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. The firm will represent the city’s interests in the wildfire recovery process, including performing damage assessments, monitoring air and water quality, interacting with various federal agencies and ensuring that the city gets as much federal reimbursement as possible, according to chief recovery officer Steve Soboroff. My prediction? Larry Fink and BlackRock. Why? Well, Ukraine. In December of 2022, I wrote a blog on a story that had been kept relatively quiet: Volodomyr Zelensky had taken “pro bono” advice from Fink to establish a “patronage program” in Ukraine, which would give foreign investors (both public and private) the chance to “adopt” areas of Ukraine that had suffered destruction during the war with Russia, and rebuild them to essentially “own” them—Zelensky was selling out what originally belonged to the people to the highest governmental and commercial bidders. Here’s what Zelensky said at the time: Even now, we create a special patronage system. The system will enable leading countries and companies to take patronage over the reconstruction of Ukrainian regions, cities, industries, and enterprises. It smelled like money laundering to me—which is coincidentally, one of the things Ukraine is best known for—and reminds me of the Clinton Foundation’s (nonexistent) “work” in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, which saw who knows how much money flood into the Clinton Foundation (Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions? Billions?), a “special patron” if you will, and essentially none to the people of Haiti. Now, details about Bass’s plan “remain scant” (shocker!), but I write this so we remember to keep an eye on it and know exactly what to look out for. Image generated by AI.

Asian shares are trading mixed after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed in thin Lunar New Year trading on Tuesday after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,959.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, inching down 0.1% to 8,399.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1% to 20,225.11. Markets in South Korea, Shanghai markets and other parts of the region were closed for holidays. Among technology companies in Japan, SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, plunging 6%. Hitachi Ltd. lost 7%, but Fujitsu and Sony Corp. recovered. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 5.5%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 1% after a marathon news conference overnight by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5% to 6,012.28, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% to 19,341.83 for its worst loss in more than a month. The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 44,713.58, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes. The shock to financial markets came from China, where an AI company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat was particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. It's unclear, however, how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that’s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia’s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. Markets are also awaiting earnings reports later this week from Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 36 cents to $73.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 42 cents to $77.50 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 155.71 Japanese yen from 154.51 yen. The euro cost $1.0441, down from $1.0493. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

NEW YORK (AP) — Rebounding tech stocks are driving U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 was 1% higher in late trading and clawing back nearly two-thirds of its earlier drop.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. We’re all a little poorer after Nvidia’s 17% dive on Tuesday (the stock had stabilised in early Wednesday NZT trading). The Nasdaq-listed chipmaker’s stock took a battering on fears that China’s low-cost DeepSeek AI heralds a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) that takes less computer grunt to train; essentially, fewer of Nvidia’s expensive chips. The promise is ChatGPT-level results (as long as you don’t ask it about Tiananmen Square) on a Temu budget. Software makers incorporate DeepSeek into their own apps at no cost. A ton of people have also tried DeepSeek for themselves over the past few days, pushing it to number one on Apple and Google’s app stores. It looks and feels a lot like ChatGPT, if you use that on your phone. You can also access DeepSeek via the web. “A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models’ workings as proprietary, DeepSeek’s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on,” says the Financial Times’ Lex. ”On the outside” is a reference to DeepSeek’s “open-source” model. Essentially that means software developers can access it for free and then tweak it to their own ends at low cost. The rise of the apparently much more computing-efficient DeepSeek could also lead to questions over “StarGate” – a AI infrastructure initiative co-announced by OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank in the Oval Office last week as Donald Trump looked on. The new President’s administration won’t chip in any funds toward the US$100 billion ($176b) to US$500b project, but has made loosely defined promises to clear red tape. Nvidia was coming off an epic bull run that had seen it become the single biggest equity holding in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s $81.6b portfolio. Many growth KiwiSaver funds have also been heavy on the stock. The AI feeding frenzy saw Nvidia’s stock gain 171% last year and kept powering upwards into early January, consolidating its position as the world’s most valuable company. But today’s rout wiped US$590b ($1.03 trillion) from Nvidia’s market value – the biggest one-day hit in Wall Street history, at least in non-inflation-adjusted dollar terms. Nvidia’s market cap fell to US$2.9t, pushing it into third place behind Apple and Microsoft. In its most recent portfolio disclosure (June 2024), the NZ Super Fund said it owned 7,856,082 Nvidia shares – which would have been worth around $2.09b on Friday and $355 million less today. The question now is whether DeepSeek has triggered the start of a months-long correction in the price of AI-related stocks and tech stocks in general – or whether the deep freakout over DeepSeek will dissipate overnight (which it seems has been the case from early Wednesday trading). The Wall Street Journal and others have noted that, so far, there’s little hard evidence of DeepSeek’s vaunted ability to be trained at ultra-low cost, using fewer chips and the geek set is arguing over whether it’s truly open source. And many are dubious that DeepSeek took just US$5.5m to develop as its makers claim, even if sanctions mean it was likely trained on cheaper, lower-grade Nvidia chips. But against that, many have seen AI stocks as being in a bubble (Nvidia is doing extremely well – its net profit increased 16% over the past quarter and 109% year-on-year to US$19.31b in the three months to October 27, 2024 – but arguably not US$3t worth of well in a world where AI faces potential energy constraints). Investors can’t spread their bets by buying into DeepSeek; it’s owned by a Chinese hedge fund called High Flyer. The NZ Super Fund – and Big Tech-heavy KiwiSaver growth funds – will be keeping a wary eye on the other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, where the news was mixed today. Google parent Alphabet was down 4.0%. Microsoft – the major backer of ChatGPT maker OpenA – was down 2.1%. Tesla was down 2.3%. (While CEO Elon Musk has talked up the potential of AI to drive growth at the EV maker – particularly with coming robo-taxis – its recent fall away has been more tied to Trump’s executive order calling for an end to EV subsidies, or at least discussion on that point). Shares in Amazon – which has a major stake in AI firm Anthropic, maker of the Claude generative AI – were flat. Claude could take a hit from DeepSeek, but the generative AI forms a relatively small part of the tech giant’s business. Apple actually climbed 3.3%. Some analysts saw DeepSeek’s emergence as a validation of Apple’s decision to develop its own chips in-house to power its Apple Intelligence. Meta shares were also in the green. The owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and the developer of the open-source Llama large language model was up 1.9%. Some have seen the company overspending on AI development. Its CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Friday his firm would spend as much as US$60b to US$65b on AI this year as it builds a massive new data centre and develops a new version of Llama. Analysts said DeepSeek illustrated that AI could be developed on a more cost-effective basis. In its most recent portfolio disclosure, the NZ Super Fund had 2,216,984 shares in Microsoft worth $1.63b; 4,512,851 shares in Apple worth $1.56b; 3,280,616 shares in Alphabet worth $984m; 2,491,984 shares in Amazon worth $790m; 640,325 shares in Meta, worth $529m; and 687084 shares in Tesla worth $223m.

Title: Nvidia calls China’s DeepSeek R1 model ‘an excellent AI advancement’: Breakthrough creates more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 5:44:32 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia called DeepSeek’s R1 model “an excellent AI advancement,” despite the Chinese startup’s emergence causing the chip maker’s stock price to plunge 17% on Monday. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” The comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - PMAY (Urban) - has made steady progress since it was announced in mid-2015. Data by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs indicates 118.64 lakh homes have been sanctioned as of 20th January 2025. Nearly 90.22 lakh units have been completed, and nearly 112.50 lakh have been ‘grounded’. In terms of the financials, nearly INR 200,000 Cr of central assistance has already been committed. Despite fairly good progress, PMAY must be made accessible to more people, and awareness about it also needs a big shot in the arm. New adaptable, sustainable and low-cost construction technologies can be used to rapidly develop large mass housing projects. The government should also try to eliminate bottlenecks in property records. An important aspect of PMAY is interest subsidy on home loans, and direct subsidy for individual house construction or enhancement. However, to qualify for these subsidies, properties need title documents - a big hurdle, since India’s land records system is far from sophisticated enough right now to address the task holistically and at scale. Any announcements that Union Budget 2025-26 will make in context with affordable housing will doubtlessly involve PMAY. Creative solutions and strong political will can bring this vitally important programme back to centre stage, which is where it belongs. Nationally, rising prices have led to a gradual tapering down of luxury housing, and this may trigger an inflection point where the cycle can once again turn positive for the affordable segment. Any substantial announcement for the affordable housing segment in the upcoming Union Budget can strengthen the trend and give affordable housing a seriously needed leg-up. The Government is expected to walk a thin line on maintaining the fiscal deficit targets and stimulating the slowing economy with increased infrastructure investments, incentives for job creation and increasing disposable income with the middle class segment. Veloce Fintech, a part of the Lemon Group, had launched its SEBI-registered Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), the Veloce Opportunities Fund.

Using a sector-agnostic approach, it supports enterprises in diverse fields such as manufacturing, technology, real estate, healthcare, and services. The fund targets a return of 18+%.

Read more We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now. From hereon, it would be very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer and other global developments, but unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. On the upside, the bearish gap of 23000-23050 is likely to resist any pullbacks ahead of the event, while the formidable obstacle is present around 23350, coinciding with the 20 DEMA. As we look ahead to the week, a plethora of events is set to unfold, each holding the potential to shift market dynamics significantly. Given this landscape of potential developments, it’s essential to remain agile and responsive. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalize on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead. It could possibly be hasty to build in rate cut expectations in the February review as the broader growth inflation mix does not unambiguously call for the same. Having said that, this remains a close call and would clearly involve a subjective call with respect to the timing. Given that liquidity actions have a far direct and sustained impact, which has clearly been done, there is clearly merit in pushing back rate cuts possibly until there is more clarity on the external front as well as evolution of domestic growth inflation mix as well as liquidity conditions over the coming quarters. The April review possibly remains a better bet for the same. In the near term, the union budget should set the tone both for any potential fiscal actions to address consumption demand in the economy and to revive private sector investments.

ENERGY International crude oil prices tumbled on Monday amid concern that weakness in China’s economy will keep its energy demand depressed.

NYMEX WTI March range for the day is between $70.65 to $76.20, while the MCX February crude futures could trade within the range of 6,110 to 6,560.

NYMEX Gas March range for the day is between $3.080 to $3.420, while the MCX February NG futures could trade within the range of 268 to 294. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 320 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 260 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. BASE METALS LME and domestic MCX copper tumbled on Monday as market sentiment was dampened by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields extended losses and capped downside on Monday’s session. On the data front, it was overall positive for the Dollar and weighed on gold and silver. Other metals ended weaker on LME and MCX on Monday’s trade. From an intraday perspective, international copper has started mixed this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading as there is broader risk-off sentiment across base metals. The Dollar Index and bond yields gained this Tuesday morning ahead of Fed. Although, the beginning of the Chinese New Year holiday today will keep volumes low. Intraday, the range for LME copper is between $8,940 to $9,320, while that for MCX February copper is between 814 to 846.

A recovery in the Dollar Index and Treasury Yields this Tuesday morning could also weigh on the Rupee. Although, a drop in the crude oil prices and possibly a small recovery on the domestic equity markets could cap losses for the Rupee. In the overseas markets, the U.S. Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields eased on Monday. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields has started with gains this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the Fed meeting outcome this week. Key triggers today will be Durable goods orders. The Euro ended marginally higher on Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia amid forecasts of a rate cut from the ECB this week. The Pound/Sterling gained against the Dollar this Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia, tracking a recovery of the greenback. The Japanese Yen appreciated against the Dollar on Monday on BoJ rate hike revisions, although the Yen started weaker further this Tuesday morning as the dollar rebounded following fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. US benchmarks showed a mix of performances, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registering losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remained positive. The decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was mainly due to the significant drop in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, after the introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI assistant that’s much cheaper than its US counterparts, affecting the AI landscape dynamics. Over in Asia, the Nikkei fell as the US tech stock turmoil spread to Japan, and the strengthening yen further dampened market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index stayed nearly flat after starting the day strong. Domestically, markets are expected to open on a positive note, but global sentiments might influence the benchmarks as the day goes on. The IT sector is predicted to remain under pressure due to the developments around DeepSeek and the general weakness in global tech sentiment. The benchmark index started the trading week with continued selling pressure from the prior session, opening 152 points lower and breaching the critical support level around 22976. This set a bearish tone for the day, culminating in a close within the lower quartile of the trading range—marking a panic day as it finished 263 points down from the previous close. This situation has resulted in significantly oversold market conditions, suggesting that the near-term incentive for additional short positions is relatively low, which is a positive development. The area around 22800 now serves as a vital support level, and maintaining a position above it will be essential to garner bullish strength. Yesterday’s trading session saw bearish sentiment dominate Dalal Street, with Nifty closing well below the 23,000 mark. Pessimism persists due to global headwinds, including uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and significant outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 74,096 crore in January. Wall Street also reacted negatively to reports of Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model, posing a challenge to major U.S. tech giants. Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1st. Stocks in focus include Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Zinc, Hyundai Motors, Cipla, TVS Motors, and Coal India, which reported a 17% decline in Q3 net profit to Rs. 8,505.57 crore. Sell Balkrishna Industries (CMP 2565) in the 2590-2610 zone with a stop at 2727 for targets of 2489/2419. Also, bearish positions are recommended for Jindal Steel & Power, Divis Lab, and Balkrishna Industries on any early intraday strength. From a technical perspective, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is forming lower tops on daily charts, which is negative. Technically, the levels of 23,000 and 23,050 would serve as key resistance areas, while 22800 and 22,750 could act as important support zones. If it falls below 22,750, selling pressure may intensify that could send market to 22600 levels. The strategy should be to reduce weak long positions around 23000-23050 levels, however, during the week if it falls to 22600 then we should look for buying select stocks with a medium to long-term view. Regarding Bank Nifty, as long as it remains below 49000, weak sentiment will likely persist. On the downside, it could decline to the 47,500-47,200 range. However, if it rises above 49,000, there could be a rebound to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or up to 49,500. “The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally. The Indian market appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 trillion is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit. After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend.” 360 ONE’s operating revenue grew 38% YoY and was 7% higher than our estimates, driven by 14% beat in transactional income. Additionally, strong beat in other income resulted in 17% beat in PAT at Rs 270 crore (+42% YoY). 360 ONE’s Board has proposed the acquisition of one of India’s leading brokerage and corporate advisory houses – B&K Securities. The proposed acquisition of B&K will add a new research capability across all platforms of 360 ONE and also provide entry into the IB segment. Since the cost structure of B&K is aligned with 360 ONE, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. We reiterate our BUY rating with a one-year target price of Rs 1,350 Investing in AI may be nothing like as expensive as previously thought. This should accelerate the advancement of the technology. But at the same time it also means that chief financial officers will start to ask questions about the enormous amounts being spent on computing power in the AI arms race. GREED & fear has been concerned that the stock market would at some point this year question all this spending in the continuing absence of clear proof of monetisation. This was, first and foremost, a potential threat to the share prices of the hyperscalers who have been spending the money. But the DeepSeek news will now cause pressure on the AI hardware supply chain on concerns that the likes of Meta will do a U-turn and slash capex spending. The other issue raised by the DeepSeek news is that, while it is clearer than ever that the age of AI is coming, it is also increasingly equally clear that the long fashionable concepts of “moats”, as applied by fund managers to individual companies in the investment world, looks ever more precarious, if not redundant, in the AI world given the monumental scope for disruption. This is highly relevant given the massive market capitalisations represented by Big Tech at a time when these companies have in practice been converging on the same AI area to compete with each other. It seems unlikely in the extreme to GREED & fear that all the current dominant incumbents will prevail in the new world order which emerges. :Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up as trend in GIFT Nifty suggest a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed. Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in U.S. chipmakers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46%, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07%, to 19,341.83. Spot gold is likely to slip towards $2720 level on strong dollar and rise in US treasury yields. Further, investors will remain cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve monetary policy where central bank is likely to keep its policy unchanged, while all eyes will be on comments to get clarity on future rate path. Additionally, market will try to decode how US President Donald Trump’s policies will impact Fed’s views on growth and inflation. Moreover, expectation of improved economic data from US will hurt prices HDFC Securities has a ‘reduce’ on Indian Oil Corporation with a target price of Rs 124, on margin pressure due to increasing petchem supplies/capacity, lower refining margins, and moderation in auto fuel marketing margins. The oil refiner’s Q3 earnings were affected by weak performance from petchem segment, lower refining margins, inventory loss and absorption of under-recovery on LPG. HDFC Sec said gross refining margin came in lower than estimates at $2.9/bbl, while gross debt rose 24% on year to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. DCB Bank over the last 4-5 quarters consistently grew its loan book and deposits at ~20% on a YoY basis. During the quarter, the Bank reported a strong loan book growth of 23%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis, with the mortgage/AIB segment contributing 45%/24% of the loan book, demonstrating a growth of 6%/3% on a QoQ and 21% each on a YoY basis. Co-lending has played a significant role in the current quarter, contributing to the surge in loan growth from 18-19% to 23% on a YoY basis. NII grew by 15%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis. NIM was stable on a QoQ basis at ~3.3%. During the quarter, the Bank’s core fee income increased by 49%/2% on a YoY/QoQ basis and costto-income ratio witnessed an improvement of 191/156 bps on a YoY/QoQ basis which led to a PPOP growth of 28%/6% on a YoY/QoQ basis. The Bank is showcasing continuous decline of slippages while the stress on MFI portfolio remained challenging, resulting in higher provisions by 64%/47% on a YoY/QoQ basis. Going forward, management aims to improve NIM, reduce cost-to-income ratio, and achieve an ROA of >1% in FY26. Lower e-auction price as well as minimal volume growth dented revenue, while EBITDA fell 13% YoY to Rs 10400 crore and EBITDA per ton fell to Rs 535 down by Rs 89/ton. Nuvama said it was trimming the coal miner’s FY25 and FY26 EBITDA by 3% and 5% respectively to factor i the lower volume. The stock was more of a dividend play, it said, adding, “We do not see much downside, but prefer to wait for volume growth to re-enter the stock.” Bank Nifty witnessed some outperformance led by index pivotal compared to the broader markets sell off across sectors and stocks to decline by 0.6% for the day. The 100-week average would be at 47,100 levels which is at support while on the higher side resistance would be at 49,200 levels. RSI is trending below the average line, and other key technical indicators are oversold form current levels so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 50,000 strikes while the downside the highest put OI has moved lower to 47,500 for the monthly expiry NIFTY-50 has closed at 7-month lows and now the support would move lower to the monthly pivot of 22,600 from current levels. We expect some sharp volatility in the second half on back of the monthly expiry in the Sensex and Bankex as well as roll over movement in individual sectors and stocks. RSI is oversold on hourly charts and expect some rebound from the lower range to test the average line from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 23,200 strikes while the downside the highest put is at 22,500 for the monthly expiry. Coal India’s 3QFY25 witnessed a decent improvement following the drag seen in 2QFY25 (which was affected by extended monsoon). The e-auction volumes also remained elevated with some increase in e-auction premiums, which supported profitability. - For FY26/FY27, we maintain our estimates and expect volumes to improve, which would boost earnings performance. The e-auction premium is expected to remain stable ahead. - The company’s focus on increasing coal-washer capacity will improve its market share in domestic coking/non-coking coal. Further, management is focusing on coalmine expansions, which would be funded via internal accruals, or COAL might borrow to undertake certain strategic diversification projects, such as RE facilities and coal gasification, et al. - At CMP, the stock is trading at 3.3x FY27E EV/EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR480 (premised on 4.5x on FY27 EV/EBITDA). - COAL remains our top pick in the metals and mining sector Wall Street tumbled on Monday on threat to US tech companies from DeepSeek, an AI competitor in China. Big Tech stocks took the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 17%, dragging the Nasdaq composite down 3% ACC’s third quarter was characterised by strong volume growth but weak unitary EBITDA, said Nomura, pointing out the duty refund masked a disappointing quarter. Adjusting for this, the EBITDA of Rs 144/ton was down 4 per cent sequentially, making ACC the only major cement producer to report a quarterly decline. Cement volumes grew 20% YoY to 10.7 million ton, above estimates. “We expect higher share of MSA (master supply agreement) volumes. This could also include some portion of Penna (unlisted) or Sanghi volumes,” said the brokerage firm. It said it maintained its ‘reduce’ recommendation and target price of Rs 1920 based on 10x one-year forward EV/EBITDA The short-term outlook is bullish for the Bank of India. The stock began the week on a positive note, surging 6 per cent on Monday. A complex inverted head and shoulder pattern is visible on the daily chart. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹101. Below this, the broad ₹100-₹97 region is the next strong support.

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - PMAY (Urban) - has made steady progress since it was announced in mid-2015. Data by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs indicates 118.64 lakh homes have been sanctioned as of 20th January 2025. Nearly 90.22 lakh units have been completed, and nearly 112.50 lakh have been ‘grounded’. In terms of the financials, nearly INR 200,000 Cr of central assistance has already been committed. Despite fairly good progress, PMAY must be made accessible to more people, and awareness about it also needs a big shot in the arm. New adaptable, sustainable and low-cost construction technologies can be used to rapidly develop large mass housing projects. The government should also try to eliminate bottlenecks in property records. An important aspect of PMAY is interest subsidy on home loans, and direct subsidy for individual house construction or enhancement. However, to qualify for these subsidies, properties need title documents - a big hurdle, since India’s land records system is far from sophisticated enough right now to address the task holistically and at scale. Any announcements that Union Budget 2025-26 will make in context with affordable housing will doubtlessly involve PMAY. Creative solutions and strong political will can bring this vitally important programme back to centre stage, which is where it belongs. Nationally, rising prices have led to a gradual tapering down of luxury housing, and this may trigger an inflection point where the cycle can once again turn positive for the affordable segment. Any substantial announcement for the affordable housing segment in the upcoming Union Budget can strengthen the trend and give affordable housing a seriously needed leg-up. The Government is expected to walk a thin line on maintaining the fiscal deficit targets and stimulating the slowing economy with increased infrastructure investments, incentives for job creation and increasing disposable income with the middle class segment.

Read more We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now. From hereon, it would be very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer and other global developments, but unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. On the upside, the bearish gap of 23000-23050 is likely to resist any pullbacks ahead of the event, while the formidable obstacle is present around 23350, coinciding with the 20 DEMA. As we look ahead to the week, a plethora of events is set to unfold, each holding the potential to shift market dynamics significantly. Given this landscape of potential developments, it’s essential to remain agile and responsive. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalize on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead. It could possibly be hasty to build in rate cut expectations in the February review as the broader growth inflation mix does not unambiguously call for the same. Having said that, this remains a close call and would clearly involve a subjective call with respect to the timing. Given that liquidity actions have a far direct and sustained impact, which has clearly been done, there is clearly merit in pushing back rate cuts possibly until there is more clarity on the external front as well as evolution of domestic growth inflation mix as well as liquidity conditions over the coming quarters. The April review possibly remains a better bet for the same. In the near term, the union budget should set the tone both for any potential fiscal actions to address consumption demand in the economy and to revive private sector investments.

ENERGY International crude oil prices tumbled on Monday amid concern that weakness in China’s economy will keep its energy demand depressed. Also, Monday’s stock rout sparked a risk-off sentiment in asset markets. Losses in crude were contained as the dollar index fell to a 5-week low.

NYMEX WTI March range for the day is between $70.65 to $76.20, while the MCX February crude futures could trade within the range of 6,110 to 6,560.

NYMEX Gas prices have started flat this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading. NYMEX Gas March range for the day is between $3.080 to $3.420, while the MCX February NG futures could trade within the range of 268 to 294. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 320 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 260 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. BASE METALS LME and domestic MCX copper tumbled on Monday as market sentiment was dampened by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields extended losses and capped downside on Monday’s session. On the data front, it was overall positive for the Dollar and weighed on gold and silver. Other metals ended weaker on LME and MCX on Monday’s trade. From an intraday perspective, international copper has started mixed this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading as there is broader risk-off sentiment across base metals. The Dollar Index and bond yields gained this Tuesday morning ahead of Fed. Although, the beginning of the Chinese New Year holiday today will keep volumes low. Intraday, the range for LME copper is between $8,940 to $9,320, while that for MCX February copper is between 814 to 846. On the MCX Copper options side, highest Call OI is at 840 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 840 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry.

A recovery in the Dollar Index and Treasury Yields this Tuesday morning could also weigh on the Rupee. Although, a drop in the crude oil prices and possibly a small recovery on the domestic equity markets could cap losses for the Rupee. In the overseas markets, the U.S. Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields eased on Monday. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields has started with gains this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the Fed meeting outcome this week. Key triggers today will be Durable goods orders. The Euro ended marginally higher on Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia amid forecasts of a rate cut from the ECB this week. The Pound/Sterling gained against the Dollar this Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia, tracking a recovery of the greenback. The Japanese Yen appreciated against the Dollar on Monday on BoJ rate hike revisions, although the Yen started weaker further this Tuesday morning as the dollar rebounded following fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. US benchmarks showed a mix of performances, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registering losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remained positive. The decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was mainly due to the significant drop in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, after the introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI assistant that’s much cheaper than its US counterparts, affecting the AI landscape dynamics. Over in Asia, the Nikkei fell as the US tech stock turmoil spread to Japan, and the strengthening yen further dampened market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index stayed nearly flat after starting the day strong. Domestically, markets are expected to open on a positive note, but global sentiments might influence the benchmarks as the day goes on. The IT sector is predicted to remain under pressure due to the developments around DeepSeek and the general weakness in global tech sentiment. The benchmark index started the trading week with continued selling pressure from the prior session, opening 152 points lower and breaching the critical support level around 22976. This set a bearish tone for the day, culminating in a close within the lower quartile of the trading range—marking a panic day as it finished 263 points down from the previous close. This situation has resulted in significantly oversold market conditions, suggesting that the near-term incentive for additional short positions is relatively low, which is a positive development. The area around 22800 now serves as a vital support level, and maintaining a position above it will be essential to garner bullish strength. Yesterday’s trading session saw bearish sentiment dominate Dalal Street, with Nifty closing well below the 23,000 mark. Pessimism persists due to global headwinds, including uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and significant outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 74,096 crore in January. Wall Street also reacted negatively to reports of Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model, posing a challenge to major U.S. tech giants. Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1st. Stocks in focus include Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Zinc, Hyundai Motors, Cipla, TVS Motors, and Coal India, which reported a 17% decline in Q3 net profit to Rs. 8,505.57 crore. Sell Balkrishna Industries (CMP 2565) in the 2590-2610 zone with a stop at 2727 for targets of 2489/2419. Also, bearish positions are recommended for Jindal Steel & Power, Divis Lab, and Balkrishna Industries on any early intraday strength. From a technical perspective, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is forming lower tops on daily charts, which is negative. Technically, the levels of 23,000 and 23,050 would serve as key resistance areas, while 22800 and 22,750 could act as important support zones. If it falls below 22,750, selling pressure may intensify that could send market to 22600 levels. The strategy should be to reduce weak long positions around 23000-23050 levels, however, during the week if it falls to 22600 then we should look for buying select stocks with a medium to long-term view. Regarding Bank Nifty, as long as it remains below 49000, weak sentiment will likely persist. On the downside, it could decline to the 47,500-47,200 range. However, if it rises above 49,000, there could be a rebound to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or up to 49,500. “The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally. The Indian market appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 trillion is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit. After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend.” 360 ONE’s operating revenue grew 38% YoY and was 7% higher than our estimates, driven by 14% beat in transactional income. Additionally, strong beat in other income resulted in 17% beat in PAT at Rs 270 crore (+42% YoY). 360 ONE’s Board has proposed the acquisition of one of India’s leading brokerage and corporate advisory houses – B&K Securities. The proposed acquisition of B&K will add a new research capability across all platforms of 360 ONE and also provide entry into the IB segment. Since the cost structure of B&K is aligned with 360 ONE, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. We reiterate our BUY rating with a one-year target price of Rs 1,350 Investing in AI may be nothing like as expensive as previously thought. This should accelerate the advancement of the technology. But at the same time it also means that chief financial officers will start to ask questions about the enormous amounts being spent on computing power in the AI arms race. GREED & fear has been concerned that the stock market would at some point this year question all this spending in the continuing absence of clear proof of monetisation. This was, first and foremost, a potential threat to the share prices of the hyperscalers who have been spending the money. But the DeepSeek news will now cause pressure on the AI hardware supply chain on concerns that the likes of Meta will do a U-turn and slash capex spending. The other issue raised by the DeepSeek news is that, while it is clearer than ever that the age of AI is coming, it is also increasingly equally clear that the long fashionable concepts of “moats”, as applied by fund managers to individual companies in the investment world, looks ever more precarious, if not redundant, in the AI world given the monumental scope for disruption. This is highly relevant given the massive market capitalisations represented by Big Tech at a time when these companies have in practice been converging on the same AI area to compete with each other. It seems unlikely in the extreme to GREED & fear that all the current dominant incumbents will prevail in the new world order which emerges. :Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up as trend in GIFT Nifty suggest a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed. Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in U.S. chipmakers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46%, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07%, to 19,341.83. Spot gold is likely to slip towards $2720 level on strong dollar and rise in US treasury yields. Further, investors will remain cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve monetary policy where central bank is likely to keep its policy unchanged, while all eyes will be on comments to get clarity on future rate path. Additionally, market will try to decode how US President Donald Trump’s policies will impact Fed’s views on growth and inflation. Moreover, expectation of improved economic data from US will hurt prices HDFC Securities has a ‘reduce’ on Indian Oil Corporation with a target price of Rs 124, on margin pressure due to increasing petchem supplies/capacity, lower refining margins, and moderation in auto fuel marketing margins. The oil refiner’s Q3 earnings were affected by weak performance from petchem segment, lower refining margins, inventory loss and absorption of under-recovery on LPG. HDFC Sec said gross refining margin came in lower than estimates at $2.9/bbl, while gross debt rose 24% on year to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. DCB Bank over the last 4-5 quarters consistently grew its loan book and deposits at ~20% on a YoY basis. During the quarter, the Bank reported a strong loan book growth of 23%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis, with the mortgage/AIB segment contributing 45%/24% of the loan book, demonstrating a growth of 6%/3% on a QoQ and 21% each on a YoY basis. Co-lending has played a significant role in the current quarter, contributing to the surge in loan growth from 18-19% to 23% on a YoY basis. NII grew by 15%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis. NIM was stable on a QoQ basis at ~3.3%. During the quarter, the Bank’s core fee income increased by 49%/2% on a YoY/QoQ basis and costto-income ratio witnessed an improvement of 191/156 bps on a YoY/QoQ basis which led to a PPOP growth of 28%/6% on a YoY/QoQ basis. The Bank is showcasing continuous decline of slippages while the stress on MFI portfolio remained challenging, resulting in higher provisions by 64%/47% on a YoY/QoQ basis. Going forward, management aims to improve NIM, reduce cost-to-income ratio, and achieve an ROA of >1% in FY26. Lower e-auction price as well as minimal volume growth dented revenue, while EBITDA fell 13% YoY to Rs 10400 crore and EBITDA per ton fell to Rs 535 down by Rs 89/ton. Nuvama said it was trimming the coal miner’s FY25 and FY26 EBITDA by 3% and 5% respectively to factor i the lower volume. The stock was more of a dividend play, it said, adding, “We do not see much downside, but prefer to wait for volume growth to re-enter the stock.” Bank Nifty witnessed some outperformance led by index pivotal compared to the broader markets sell off across sectors and stocks to decline by 0.6% for the day. The 100-week average would be at 47,100 levels which is at support while on the higher side resistance would be at 49,200 levels. RSI is trending below the average line, and other key technical indicators are oversold form current levels so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 50,000 strikes while the downside the highest put OI has moved lower to 47,500 for the monthly expiry NIFTY-50 has closed at 7-month lows and now the support would move lower to the monthly pivot of 22,600 from current levels. We expect some sharp volatility in the second half on back of the monthly expiry in the Sensex and Bankex as well as roll over movement in individual sectors and stocks. RSI is oversold on hourly charts and expect some rebound from the lower range to test the average line from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 23,200 strikes while the downside the highest put is at 22,500 for the monthly expiry. Coal India’s 3QFY25 witnessed a decent improvement following the drag seen in 2QFY25 (which was affected by extended monsoon). The e-auction volumes also remained elevated with some increase in e-auction premiums, which supported profitability. - For FY26/FY27, we maintain our estimates and expect volumes to improve, which would boost earnings performance. The e-auction premium is expected to remain stable ahead. - The company’s focus on increasing coal-washer capacity will improve its market share in domestic coking/non-coking coal. Further, management is focusing on coalmine expansions, which would be funded via internal accruals, or COAL might borrow to undertake certain strategic diversification projects, such as RE facilities and coal gasification, et al. - At CMP, the stock is trading at 3.3x FY27E EV/EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR480 (premised on 4.5x on FY27 EV/EBITDA). - COAL remains our top pick in the metals and mining sector Wall Street tumbled on Monday on threat to US tech companies from DeepSeek, an AI competitor in China. Big Tech stocks took the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 17%, dragging the Nasdaq composite down 3% ACC’s third quarter was characterised by strong volume growth but weak unitary EBITDA, said Nomura, pointing out the duty refund masked a disappointing quarter. Adjusting for this, the EBITDA of Rs 144/ton was down 4 per cent sequentially, making ACC the only major cement producer to report a quarterly decline. Cement volumes grew 20% YoY to 10.7 million ton, above estimates. “We expect higher share of MSA (master supply agreement) volumes. This could also include some portion of Penna (unlisted) or Sanghi volumes,” said the brokerage firm. It said it maintained its ‘reduce’ recommendation and target price of Rs 1920 based on 10x one-year forward EV/EBITDA The short-term outlook is bullish for the Bank of India.

Title: What is China’s DeepSeek and why is it freaking out the AI world?

Full Content:
Bengaluru - DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up that is just over a year old, has stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley after demonstrating breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) models that offer comparable performance to the worldâs best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeekâs emergence may offer a counterpoint to the belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. Global technology stocks tumbled as hype around DeepSeekâs innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and hardware suppliers. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Mr Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January.Â The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAIâs ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its new AI model, R1, offers performance on a par with OpenAIâs latest and has granted licence for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Â Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeekâs models appears to be only a fraction of what is required for OpenAI or Meta Platformsâ best products. The modelâs much-better efficiency puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. That amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China, which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. DeepSeek says R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks: MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors to China, in a bid to stall the countryâs advances in AI, the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it is unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company has showed enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymieing the countryâs progress. The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. It gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January became known as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it âAIâs Sputnik momentâ. OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said on X: âDeepSeekâs R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what theyâre able to deliver for the price.â The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and Britain, according to market tracker App Figures. Born in Guangdong in 1985, Mr Liang received bachelorâs and mastersâ degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek in 2023 with 10 million yuan (S$1.9 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fund-raising, he told Chinese media outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem.Â âMore investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,â Mr Liang said. Chinaâs technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu to Tencent Holdings, have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside chief executive Kai-Fu Leeâs 01.AI start-up, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach â which is designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetisation strategies. Because DeepSeekâs models are more affordable, it has played a role in helping to drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that has seen successive waves of price cuts over the past 1Â½ years. DeepSeekâs success may push OpenAI and US providers to lower pricing to maintain their established lead. It calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft â each of which has committed to capital expenditure of US$65 billion (S$87.7 billion) or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure â if more efficient models can also compete with a much smaller outlay.Â That roiled global stock markets as investors sold off companies like Nvidia and ASML Holding that have benefited from booming demand for AI services. Shares in Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek, climbed. Developers around the world are already experimenting with DeepSeekâs software to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models â while potentially touching off additional concern about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeekâs advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed.Â Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeekâs cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. It also briefly experienced a major outage on Jan 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot.Â BLOOMBERG JoinÂ ST's Telegram channelÂ and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Title: Nvidia sheds $792 billion of market value in DeepSeek rout, biggest one-day loss in US history

NEW YORK - Nvidiaâs share plunge, fuelled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the worldâs largest company.Â Nvidiaâs shares tumbled 17 per cent on Jan 27, erasing US$589 billion (S$792 billion) from the companyâs market capitalisation. That eclipsed the previous record â a 9 per cent drop in September that wiped out about US$279 billion in value â and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Jan 27âs slump, Nvidia sell-offs have caused eight of the top 10 biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Jan 27 and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3 per cent. The semiconductor maker led a broader sell-off in technology stocks after DeepSeekâs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing AI. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price.Â The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of ChatGPTâs OpenAI and Facebookâs Meta Platforms. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Appleâs App Store rankings. Â âConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,â Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because it designs semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that are not showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Jan 24 to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as US$65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group and Oracle announcing a US$100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centres and AI infrastructure projects around the United States. In a bid to stall Chinaâs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement on Jan 27 that DeepSeekâs model is an âexcellent AI advancementâ and indicated that the Chinese company did not violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, ârequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networkingâ.

Title: NVIDIA May Be Cooked

By Adam Sharp Posted January 27, 2025 On Friday evening, we covered DeepSeek R1, the Chinese AI breakthrough rattling NVIDIA and broader markets. I wrote the following: The implications are massive. In the long run, this could threaten not just American AI software companies, but also NVIDIA. If cutting-edge models can be trained with 5% of the previous hardware requirements, what does that mean for GPU sales going forward? When I wrote that Friday morning, I considered buying some puts on NVDA. But I didn’t pull the trigger. I thought we had more time. Of course, today I woke up to NVIDIA crashing in pre-market trading. It was down up to 13% before markets opened, and as I write this at around 11:00 am, NVDA shares are now down 15%. In full disclosure, I did buy a few NVDA puts just after markets opened today (even though they were about 3x more expensive than Friday). I have a short position here, so please take what I say about NVIDIA with a pinch of salt. I am now biased. I bought the NVDA puts as a hedge because of how incredibly important NVIDIA has become to the U.S. economy. NVIDIA’s market cap, still around $3 trillion as I write this, is about 10% of 2024 U.S. GDP. So NVDA’s current valuation equates it to roughly 10% of the value of all American goods and services produced over 12 months. That is borderline ludicrous. The company’s remarkable run has essentially carried markets higher over the past few years. Wall Street currently expects NVIDIA earnings to more than double from $1.30/share in 2024 to $2.95/share in 2025. By 2028, analysts expect the company to produce $6.15 in earnings per share. If Wall Street’s 2028 prediction comes true, at current prices NVIDIA would be trading at 20x earnings (a P/E of 20) in 3 years. That’s IF they can grow earnings by 4.7x over the next 36 months. So the pricing is getting ridiculous. The old adage “priced for perfection” fits this stock well. Yes, NVIDIA is a great company with a special founder/CEO. But it appears they may finally hit a peak for this cycle. And when these types of bubbles unravel, they tend to do so quickly. Hot stocks take the stairs up, and the elevator down. If this whole thing about China’s AI breakthrough proves to be overblown, I’ll be thrilled my puts expire worthless. The risk to markets is that significant. If the threat proves to be real, at least I’ll have some downside protection. Earlier this month, our own Jim Rickards warned about how fragile this market is in Positioned For a Historic Crash. Here’s an excerpt: “We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or another unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. Prepare now. Don’t be the last one to know.” The market may have found Jim’s “unexpected event”: China’s AI breakthroughs (see Friday’s article if you need a primer). Currently the S&P 500 is only down about 2% from its all-time highs. So if you do want to get prepared for a potential crash, there’s still time. But with NVIDIA down 15% as I write this, we could easily see a full-blown market panic develop. I sincerely hope it doesn’t happen, but I believe it’s time to prepare for a significant correction. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, cash is increasingly attractive. Disclosure: Author owns NVIDIA put options.

Title: What Silicon Valley Leaders Are Saying About China’s A.I. Miracle DeepSeek

The sudden arrival of breakthrough A.I. models from DeepSeek, a Chinese A.I. startup, has drawn ire, envy and admiration from Silicon Valley’s elite. Demonstrating capabilities that rival A.I. leaders like OpenAI, Meta (META) and Anthropic, DeepSeek’s models were developed with a fraction of the costs of their U.S. counterparts—a feat that has caught much of the tech industry by surprise.

You can opt out anytime. DeepSeek’s V3 model, released in December and followed by a new reasoning model earlier this month, was created with only 2,000 of Nvidia (NVDA)’s pricey graphics processing units (GPUs), according to the Hangzhou-based startup, which grew out of the hedge fund High-Flyer just last year. The company’s self-claimed ability to create advanced A.I. models on the cheap spooked investors betting on American A.I. giants. Nvidia shares tumbled 17 percent today (Jan. 27). Stocks of AMD, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) also fell. As some tech leaders question whether DeepSeek has more A.I. chips than it’s letting on, others advocate for tougher GPU export controls to prevent China from gaining an edge in the new technology. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s breakthrough a modern-day “Sputnik moment.” Microsoft’s Satya Nadella praised the company’s efficiency, and Meta’s chief A.I. scientist Yann LeCun lauded its decision to open source. One thing’s for sure: DeepSeek’s developments have got Silicon Valley talking. Here’s a look at what prominent tech figures are saying about the startup’s surprising success: Marc Andreessen, general partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, described DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model, released on Jan. 20, as A.I.’s “Sputnik moment” in a post on X yesterday (Jan. 26), referencing how the unexpected success of the Soviet Union’s 1957 satellite launch spurred the U.S. to step up its space efforts. DeepSeek-R1 “is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” added Andreessen, who praised the company’s decision to open source the model as “a profound gift to the world.” DeepSeek’s performance isn’t necessarily telling of China’s A.I. capabilities surpassing those of the U.S., according to Yann LeCun, but instead highlights the power of open source. “The correct reading is: ‘Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones,'” the computer scientist said in a recent post on Meta’s Threads. LeCun additionally called the A.I. stock selloff in reaction to DeepSeek “woefully unjustified,” noting that much of the money tech companies spend on A.I. isn’t necessarily used to train models but to run them. For some tech leaders, DeepSeek’s breakthrough is a sign that the U.S. should continue cracking down on chip export controls. Dario Amodei recently told CNBC that he believes Chinese A.I. companies have more GPUs than expected, as many were able to procure vast amounts of the hardware before such restrictions were implemented. In the case of DeepSeek, “it’s been reported, at least, that they have a cluster of 50,000,” said Amodei. According to the Anthropic CEO, export controls must focus on preventing chip stockpiles from growing into the millions. “I think if the United States can’t lead in this technology, we’re going to be in a very bad place geopolitically,” Amodei told CNBC. To Marc Benioff, DeepSeek’s newfound popularity proves that data, not compute or models, will make the difference for tech companies going forward. “The real treasure of A.I. isn’t the [user interface] or the model—they’ve become commodities,” said Benioff in a post on X yesterday, where he noted that DeepSeek’s success was achieved without vast funds or Nvidia chips. “The true value lies in data and metadata, the oxygen fueling A.I.’s potential.” While speaking with CNBC in Davos earlier this month, Satya Nadella lauded the Chinese startup’s progress. “I think we should take the development out of China very, very seriously,” said Nadella, who described the DeepSeek models as “super impressive.” The CEO followed up on his comments today with an X post seemingly linking DeepSeek to “Jevons paradox,” an economic theory that posits heightened efficiency leads to resource consumption instead of reduction. “As A.I. gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of,” he said.

Title: Deepseek Announcement Sinks The American Tech Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/01/27/deepseek-announcement-sinks-the-american-tech-market/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T21:36:51Z

Horizontal color image of a data center from a drone point of view. Amid a free-ranging route of U.S. tech stocks, investors are wondering how the new announcement from Chinese firm DeepSeek, of a new efficient reasoning model to be reckoned with, is going to affect the industry long-term. It’s not just investors, either – the big question for many people looking at the global race for AI is whether DeepSeek’s result really will deliver a great reasoning model for a lot lower cost than its American competitors. In the past few cycles, the world saw double-digit losses for Nvidia, and other negative action, like Palantir dipping 6%, that’s making the bulls nervous. We’ve even seen other kinds of U.S. stocks like nuclear stocks tanking on the premise that America might be spending less on dominating AI and data center markets in the future. "DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less," said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, as reported by Aimee Picchi at CBS News. "This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years." But it’s worth thinking a little more long-term about this, since we’re likely to have a pretty big global market for AI in the years to come. People are referring to the DeepSeek announcement as America’s “Sputnik moment” for the AI age, when U.S. parties had a right to be spooked. However, others are asking whether the proof is in the pudding, and whether DeepSeek really does have an advanced edge over the American systems. A team of writers at Bloomberg reported: “(Some) investors, like Fares Hendi at French asset manager Prevoir AM, say they’re holding onto their Nvidia shares and waiting for more information about DeepSeek’s technological promise.” “If they really need less chips to make their model run, then yes the threat is real, it would weigh on growth and valuation,” Hendi said, as reported in Bloomberg. “But at the moment, we’re going to take the time to really look into it.” Then, too, some who were quoted suggested the news might be good for AI, in the long-term and from a big-picture perspective: “It would seem to me that if you still believe that AI is going to be big, this news out of China should only make you feel better… and perhaps present you with some buying opportunities,” said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert. “To be clear, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be bumps or risks (as price seeking continues). But it should be clear that there are some stocks that will be down this morning for the wrong reasons.” Financial pros weighed in on the phenomenon, too. “It’s safe to say that anything US-AI related was very crowded and anything tech-related in China was very under owned,” explains Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. “So you are going to see a bit of a unwind of those two different crowded sides. It’ll be interesting to see if the options market picks some winners and losers.” Over the past few years, we’ve seen OpenAI and Anthropic and others continue to develop advanced reasoning systems in a way that suggested America was going to be king of the AI world for the duration. But people close to the industry knew that China had its own research teams and systems that were likely to give other nations a run for their money. Time will tell how much fire power DeepSeek has and whether it will continue to depress the American technology sector in the stock market. Another argument emerges that China and the U.S. can both reign supreme in their own hemispheres, in terms of AI systems. Some of the above quotes hint at that, too. Of course, there’s always going to be one particular model that’s better than any others, but there’s also room for customization and specialization in these systems. It’s one thing to concede that stocks like Nvidia, which had wildly spiraled up based on U.S. dominance predictions, is going to keep its high valuation, but it’s another thing to wonder whether China will have an outside influence on American AI systems. Like anything related to the lightning-speed transformation of LLMs in business, the U.S./China divide is going to take some time to figure out. When the dust clears, what will we see? One Community.

Title: Nvidia is doing damage control after DeepSeek's AI advance routed the stock

Nvidia (NVDA-5.19%) addressed its tumbling stock on Monday by saying Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek will need more of its chips for new models. The chipmaker’s shares were down by more than 17% toward the end of the trading day on Monday after being down most of the day amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with Quartz. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking.” According to the Hangzhou-based startup, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks — for a fraction of the cost and energy. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta (META-0.22%), and Google (GOOGL-0.08%) spending billions of dollars on its advanced chips. In December, DeepSeek released its V3 model, which it said used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Aside from prompting concerns about high AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success also calls into question U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering China. The Chinese firm trained and developed DeepSeek-V3 with Nvidia’s H800 chips, according to a technical report, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by OpenAI, Meta, and other U.S. competitors. Nvidia is allowed to sell the less-powerful version of its H100 chips to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions.

(Bloomberg) -- As levered-up US investors sustained eye-popping losses in tech stocks and related ETFs on Monday, they could take some comfort from the fact that another batch of speculative traders across the Atlantic had it even worse.

That eclipsed even twice-levered US single-stock funds like GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (ticker NVDL), which was on course to drop a record 36% as of Monday afternoon. All types of leveraged products were caught in the global market rout caused by DeepSeek, which over the weekend rose to the top of Apple’s app store charts. Analysts said the model represents a serious competitor to products from American firms like OpenAI that are costlier to run. In Europe, investors have access to more highly-levered products, including some that offer five times the daily return of their underlying holdings. American traders, meanwhile, are limited to double-levered ETFs on single companies, though some triple-levered products exist. The drop in the Leverage Shares 3x product underscores how “concentration can cut both ways,” said Athanasios Psarofagis at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s been a good run, but sometimes you’ll be subject to these idiosyncratic days.” Exchange-traded products such as the ones tied to Nvidia use derivatives to amplify returns or provide inverse performance and have notoriously been caught up in previous market meltdowns. Still, retail investors have flocked to them, drawn in by the desire to chase big returns. Monday’s wipe-out might not dissuade such investors from trading them, Psarofagis added. “Investors are well aware of the risks.” And for investors who get the direction right, they can pay off. The Nvidia fund’s bearish equivalent, which delivers three-times the inverse of the stock’s performance, was up 58%. That product, though, is much smaller, having started the day with less than $6 million in assets. --With assistance from Denitsa Tsekova, Bailey Lipschultz and Sam Potter.

A Dutch pension fund is considering cutting ties with BlackRock because of the manager’s departure from the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative. PME Pensioenfonds, a pension fund for the metals and technology industry which has more than 620,000 participants, said it was reconsidering the future of its 5 billion euros invested with the manager, according to a memo seen by CIO. The pension fund is among the largest in the Netherlands, with more than 280 billion euros ($294.17 billion) in assets under management. The fund’s investments with BlackRock include money market funds and several index portfolios. PME reportedly controls the composition of, and proxy voting policy of, the investments. The pension fund has said it seeks partners that abide by net-zero plans, and stated concern in the memo with what it called BlackRock’s diminishing ambitions and efforts to support sustainable investing. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  BlackRock departed the initiative, which has sought a transition to net-zero emission portfolios by 2050 and counted 325 signatories who collectively managed $57.5 trillion in assets, earlier this month. The initiative had seen numerous members leave over the past year, including Northern Trust this month. Similar initiatives, such as the Climate Action 100+, which BlackRock also left, and the Net Zero Banking Alliance have seen scores of departures; by the middle of January, all major U.S. banks had withdrawn from the later. BlackRock’s departure from NZAM was significant; the firm has $11.5 billion in assets under management. NZAM suspended its activities shortly after BlackRock’s departure. Despite a pullback from environmental, social, and governance and net-zero initiatives by U.S.-based investors, European ones appear to be continuing their commitments to these values. BlackRock, in the U.S., has been a target of political opponents of ESG and net-zero investing over the manager’s membership in initiatives like the NZAM.

Title: Super Micro Computer Stock: Where Is It Heading In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/super-micro-computer-smci-stock-2025-forecast/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T20:18:49Z

Super Micro Computer's low price may be a buying opportunity if you can accept the risks. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock was a roller-coaster ride in 2024. The circumstances contributing to SMCI's rise and fall have angered some shareholders and polarized analysts, prompting ratings from sell to strong buy. So, what's next for Super Micro in 2025? Let's review the relevant factors to decide. Super Micro Computer makes and sells high-powered server and storage solutions. Like Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro has delivered consensus-beating performance on strong demand for its AI-capable hardware—including servers and liquid cooling systems. Energy-efficient liquid cooling systems are increasingly becoming must-haves for high-powered data centers. One of Super Micro's competitive advantages is its ability to deploy custom server solutions quickly. The company also has important AI computing partnerships with Nvidia and Fujitsu. In August 2024, short seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging accounting manipulation at Super Micro. This is the company's second reported accounting issue in recent history. In 2020, the SEC fined Super Micro and its former CFO for prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses. Super Micro's leadership team has denied the 2024 claims of accounting manipulation. However, the company has not filed financial statements with the SEC since reporting its March 31 quarterly results in May 2024. Failure to file on time is grounds for delisting by the Nasdaq. The company requested a filing extension to avoid delisting. Nasdaq has given Super Micro until Feb. 25 to report on the June and September quarters of 2024. The following financial review of Super Micro considers third and fourth-quarter earnings releases and a preliminary first-quarter report released in November 2024. This data may be unreliable if the Hindenburg allegations are partially or wholly true. Here is a look at SMCI by the numbers per the fiscal-year 2024 earnings release: According to the available financial statements, SMCI doubled annual revenue and grew diluted EPS by 60% in fiscal year 2024. CEO Charles Liang attributed the increases to "record demand of new AI infrastructures." Preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 show continued sales growth and a lower gross margin. Estimated results included first-quarter 2025 sales of $5.9 billion to $6 billion and gross margin of 13.3%. Sales and gross margin in the prior-year quarter were $2.12 billion and 16.7%, respectively. Through the calendar year 2023, Super Micro had minimal long-term debt. In 2024, the company sold $1.725 billion in convertible notes to institutional investors. The notes carry 0% interest and are due in 2029. They can be redeemed early under certain conditions. The senior notes raised SMCI's debt-to-equity ratio from nearly zero to a reasonable 0.40. Super Micro has said it will use the proceeds to fund working capital and growth. With low debt and strong demand for its AI-capable server systems, Super Micro appears healthy financially. The company's extreme growth starting in 2022 did pressure cash flow and margins. But after the 2024 convertible notes issuance, Super Micro should have more than $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet. SMCI gained almost 8% in 2024, but it was a wild ride. After starting the year at about $28 per share, the stock eclipsed $115 in March. At that point, SMCI was one of the best growth stocks of the year. Then, the stock fell into the $50s after the company announced a sizable gross margin decline. The release of the Hindenburg Research report pushed the stock down further. SMCI stock was trading for $18 in late October, before climbing back to the $30s by year-end. Note that SMCI completed a 10-for-1 stock split in September 2024. The stock values shared are adjusted for that split. The fallout from the reports about alleged accounting irregularities will shape SMCI's near-term prospects. Other factors to watch include the demand for AI servers and innovation from competitors. Short sellers are in the business of convincing the public that certain stocks are worthless. Recognizing that short sellers benefit from stock price declines, many investors respond to short-seller claims with healthy skepticism. In the case of Super Micro, the Hindenburg Research report did prompt a sell-off as investors weighed corroborating evidence of misconduct. As noted, this isn't the first time SMCI has been accused of departing from accepted accounting practices. The prior accounting investigation prompted a temporary delisting by the Nasdaq and hefty fines from the SEC. There was no admission or denial of guilt by Super Micro at that time. The Hindenburg report alleges the company rehired executives who were fired in the wake of the first SEC investigation. The report also says the SMCI restarted unlawful revenue recognition practices months after settling with the SEC. Super Micro has denied the Hindenburg claims, calling them “false or inaccurate.” More concerning was the October 2024 resignation of SMCI's accounting firm Ernst & Young. The company's extended delay in publishing financial statements also sends a problematic message. How SMCI moves through this crisis is uncertain. In December, the CEO Liang expressed confidence that the stock would not be delisted. But Super Micro may have lost the trust of the investing public and that will take time to earn back—no matter how strong the business is. Research firm Gartner predicts data center systems spending will grow from $318 billion in 2024 to $367 billion in 2025. That equates to a 15.5% increase. The growth should benefit SMCI as a preferred provider of AI-capable server systems, storage and cooling systems. SMCI's accounting troubles present an opportunity for competitors. Super Micro is a market share leader in AI servers, a subset of the broader computer hardware segment. Large and small hardware providers would benefit from stealing the AI crown as Super Micro works to repair its reputation. Super Micro Computer competitors include Dell Technologies (DELL), HP (HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pure Storage (PSTG), Seagate Technology (STX), Logitech International (LOGI) and PAR Technology (PAR). For more AI investing ideas, see this best AI stocks for 2025. Analysts' average price target for SMCI is $62.03, which is 85% higher than the stock's current value of about $33. Two analysts have downgraded the stock since October. After those downgrades, the average rating is hold. The income statement outlook for SMCI remains promising. Analysts expect 70% revenue growth and 48% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. The percentages equate to revenue of $25 billion and EPS of $2.97. Analysts expect continued, slower growth in fiscal year 2026—an estimated increase of 20% to 25% for revenue and EPS. Strong business performance can inspire investors to overlook other problems. If Super Micro can meet its February filing deadline and avoid delisting, investors will likely refocus on the company's profit potential. Unfortunately, that potential could be less impressive than previously thought. With correct accounting treatment, SMCI may have slower revenue growth and higher margins. Legal fees and settlements may also have an impact. The company has a Justice Department investigation to manage, plus a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders in October. SMCI stock will probably be volatile throughout 2025. If the company can commit to lawful financial reporting without losing its competitive edge, 2026 will be a better year. Bottom Line Super Micro Computer was an AI success story less than a year ago. Today, the company is under a cloud, with a low stock price to prove it. The low price may be a buying opportunity if you can accept the risks. After all, the company has ample cash on the balance sheet and steep demand for its products. But the risks, including the possibility of SMCI getting delisted, are considerable. For less risky investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. SMCI generates revenue by selling AI-capable computer hardware in the U.S. and internationally. Super Micro Computer has a reputation for innovation. The company is known for its ability to deploy custom, energy-efficient solutions quickly. A major risk of investing in SMCI is that the company gets delisted from the Nasdaq and must be traded over the counter (OTC). OTC stocks are less liquid and, often, considered less valuable than exchange-trade stocks.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Alternative Meat Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stands against the other alternative meat stocks. The alternative meat industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by environmental concerns, health consciousness, and technological advancements. As of 2025, the market continues to expand, with notable developments in both plant-based and cultivated meat sectors. According to a report by research firm Mordor Intelligence, at the end of 2024, the global meat substitutes market was valued at around $10.36 billion, with projections to reach over $18 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11.76% during the forecast period. Similarly, Business Research Company, another market intelligence firm, estimates that the market size for cultivated meat is expected to grow from $9.31 billion in 2024 to close to $11 billion in 2025, at an annual growth rate of 18%. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Several factors are contributing to the burgeoning alternative meat industry. The most important of these is environmental sustainability. Alternative meats, particularly plant-based options, are recognized for their lower environmental impact compared to traditional meat. A study by the Food Foundation, quoted by prominent British newspaper The Guardian, found that plant-based meat alternatives result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and require less water. Another factor contributing to alternative meat popularity is health considerations. The same study noted that plant-based alternatives often contain fewer calories, less saturated fat, and more fiber than conventional meat products. However, it also highlighted that some alternatives may have higher salt content and lack certain nutrients like iron and vitamin B12. Innovations in food technology have led to the development of lab-grown meats, offering solutions to ethical and environmental issues associated with traditional meat production. The cultivated meat industry is projected to be valued at $25 billion globally by 2030. Despite the positive trajectory, the alternative meat industry faces several challenges. These include production costs, consumer acceptance, and nutritional fortification, among others. With increasing investments, technological innovations, and a growing consumer base seeking sustainable and healthy food options, the industry is set to play a significant role in the future of food production. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected food stocks that offer alternative meat products. Companies that mainly produce beef are also included in the list for comparison purposes. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A farmer in a field, bringing in the harvest of live fed cattle for the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) operates as a food company worldwide. Tyson Foods has expanded into the alternative meat market over the past few years, offering various plant-based and blended products. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. As per the report for the fourth quarter of 2024, the sales were $13,565 million, increasing 1.6% from the prior year, and the GAAP operating income was $525 million, increasing $988 million from the prior year. This demonstrates the company's efficient core business operations, driven by better cost management and improved pricing, leading to higher profitability. Moreover, the company has introduced the Jimmy Dean Plant-Based Breakfast Sausage Patty, which aims to deliver the signature taste of the traditional Jimmy Dean sausage in a plant-based format. This would appeal to consumers seeking healthier meat alternatives. Lastly, the company has also launched the Raised & Rooted brand, which includes various plant-based products such as burger patties, bratwurst, Italian sausages, and ground meat alternatives. Overall TSN ranks 4th on our list of the best alternative meat stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of TSN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than TSN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

January 27, 2025 14:49 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Defense stocks were in focus after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, and could present an intriguing opportunity for investors looking to extend Wall Street's tailwinds into February. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) are among the best names to own next month. AXON and NOC averaged impressive February gains of 8% and 4.1% over the past 10 years, respectively, both finishing higher nine times out of 10. From AXON's current perch, a move of similar magnitude would place it above $650 for the first time since December, while NOC could conquer $520 for the first time since November. AXON was last seen down 1.2% to trade at $603.16 at last check, but boasts a massive 139.5% year-over-year lead. The equity has been struggling with overhead pressure at its 40-day moving average since pulling back from its Dec. 6. record peak of $698.67. NOC sports a much more modest 13.9% lead for the last 12 months, but was last seen 0.7% higher to trade at $500.62. The shares are now looking to snap a three-day losing streak and are consolidating above their 60-day trendline. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Stocks Get Crushed, Crypto Traders Liquidated for $983,889,444 As ChatGPT Rival DeepSeek Spooks Markets

A new Chinese advancement in artificial intelligence, DeepSeek, has left US markets feeling unsettled, triggering corrections in equities and crypto assets. DeepSeek, a startup based in Hangzhou, China, released its open-source large language model (LLM) app for free on Monday morning after reportedly spending only $5.58 million to develop and train it – a small fraction of the cost of ChatGPT, which hasn’t been publicly acknowledged by OpenAI but was estimated to be at least over $100 million. OpenAI is valued at $157 billion and recently pledged to raise $500 billion for AI infrastructure in the United States, but some say such numbers may be called into question given DeepSeek’s apparent cost-efficiency. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told BBC, “This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn’t necessarily been forefront, so it’s taken the market a little bit by surprise… So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that’s going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they’ve already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.” US tech billionaire and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, said that the release of DeepSeek R1 was China’s “Sputnik Moment,” referring to the Soviet Union beating the Americans to space with the first artificial Earth satellite. At time of writing, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) – a member of the “Magnificent 7” – plummeted on Monday and is now down 22% from its January high after losing over $400 billion from its market cap. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices are also down 1.75% and 3.19% respectively on the day. Bitcoin and digital assets followed a similar path. According to crypto data aggregator Coinglass, there have been over $975 million in liquidations in just 24 hours, mostly traders attempting to long Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins with leverage. BTC is trading at $99,789 at time of writing, and virtually all other digital assets are in the red on the day.

Title: Stock selloff gets ugly as AI jitters jolt trading: Markets wrap

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000.“What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.”Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern – for today, anyway – that the new president’s policies will stoke inflation.The severity of the selloff in U.S. assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names.“The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20.The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98.“I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.”At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks.“We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.”Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical.“Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said.The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.“Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households.However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.”“We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.”To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon.“If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted.In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32.All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies.Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years.“This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.”“We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.Metrics like capex-to-sales ratios and free cash flows suggest that, for now, megacap tech firms are not overextended, they said. Overinvestment should be assessed in aggregate, in our view, given AI’s potential to unlock new revenue streams across the economy, they concluded.What exactly is DeepSeek?DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the U.S. after its release in early January.The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Corporate Highlights:—UBS Group AG has begun a wave of job cuts in its home market Switzerland, with hundreds of employees receiving notice in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.—AT&T Inc. posted fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections, including better-than expected increases in mobile-phone customers and fiber-based internet subscribers, driven by seasonal promotions and bundled product offerings.—Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group has nominated nine candidates for United States Steel Corp.’s board and is pushing for the company to abandon a takeover by Nippon Steel Corp.—SoFi Technologies Inc. published a forecast for profit that missed analysts’ estimates.—MicroStrategy Inc. bought $1.1 billion of Bitcoin, after announcing plans for the early redemption of convertible notes and approving an increase to amount of authorized common shares.Key events this week:—U.S. consumer confidence, durable goods, Tuesday—Fed rate decision followed by news conference by Chair Jerome Powell, Wednesday—Canada rate decision, Wednesday—Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, ASML earnings, Wednesday—Eurozone ECB rate decision, consumer confidence, unemployment, GDP, Thursday—U.S. GDP, jobless claims, Thursday—Apple, Deutsche Bank, Thursday—ECB rate decision followed by news conference by President Christine Lagarde, Thursday—U.S. personal income & spending, PCE inflation, employment cost index, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:Stocks—The S&P 500 fell 1.9% as of 2:51 p.m. New York time—The Nasdaq 100 fell 3.7%—The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%—The MSCI World Index fell 1.5%—Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index fell 3.7%—Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index fell 10%—The Russell 2000 Index fell 1.4%Currencies—The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%—The euro was little changed at $1.0492—The British pound was little changed at $1.2487—The Japanese yen rose 1% to 154.47 per dollarCryptocurrencies—Bitcoin fell 4.9% to $99,401.98—Ether fell 6.7% to $3,075.6Bonds—The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%—Germany’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 2.53%—Britain’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 4.59%Commodities—West Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.2% to $73.04 a barrel—Spot gold fell 1.2% to $2,738.57 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.(With assistance from Margaryta Kirakosian, Allegra Catelli and Catherine Bosley.)©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names. “The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98. “I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.” At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks. “We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.” Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical. “Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said. The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households. However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.” “We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.” To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon. “If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted. In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32. All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years. “This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.” “We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid.

Title: AI-themed ETFs plunge in wake of DeepSeek news

Business Deepseek logo is seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration :Prices of exchange-traded funds with outsize exposure to Nvidia plunged on Monday in reaction to news that a Chinese startup has launched a powerful new artificial intelligence model. Technology market insiders like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen have labeled the emergence of year-old DeepSeek's model a "Sputnik moment" for U.S. AI companies, most of whose share prices slid on news that downloads of DeepSeek already have overtaken those of U.S. rival ChatGPT on Apple's online app store. While Nvidia's share price traded about 17.3 per cent lower by midafternoon on Monday, prices of exchange-traded funds that offer leveraged exposure to the chipmaker plunged still further. The four ETFs that offer daily returns of double the gain in Nvidia were hit with the biggest decline, with the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF nosediving 34.5 per cent. Its leveraged inverse counterpart, which offers investors a gain of double any losses in Nvidia's stock, soared nearly 34 per cent. "These movements were to be expected, given what we saw happen with Nvidia," said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares. "We won't begin to get a sense of how much we're seeing in outflows or inflows until after the market is closed, though." Other leveraged ETFs with large Nvidia exposure made equally dramatic moves. The ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF, which targets a return double that of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index and has more than 40 per cent of its assets in Nvidia, tumbled 24.43 per cent by midday on Monday. Those ETF providers could not immediately be reached for comment. "Volatility is what the gamblers in single-stock ETFs are looking for," said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar. "Those that have a bad experience now might shy away in future, but I’m sure they’ll be replaced by others." The leveraged ETFs, which carry relatively high fees of close to 1 per cent compared with about 0.4 per cent for a typical actively managed ETF, are the domain of retail traders and speculators, Armour added. But other ETFs were caught up in the selling, including many owned by institutions and retail investors with a longer investment time horizon. For instance, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund traded down 5.25 per cent by midafternoon on Monday. Nvidia is the fund's second-largest holding, at nearly 15 per cent of the portfolio. The VistaShares Artificial Intelligence Supercycle ETF lost about 10 per cent by midafternoon. It has a smaller exposure to Nvidia - only 3 per cent - but owns a wide variety of other AI stocks. "Innovation and competition emerging in something as early-stage and dynamic as AI is not that surprising," said Adam Patti, co-founder and CEO of VistaShares. "The market will have to sort itself out over the months and years, as to what works and what will prevail." The rapid growth of AI enthusiasm sent assets in the VistaShares ETF - launched only seven weeks ago - to more than $3 million by Friday, the firm said. The 2x GraniteShares Nvidia ETF - the largest of the leveraged funds - had $5.3 billion in assets as of Friday, according to data from VettaFi, accounting for about half of GraniteShares' total assets. "This has been a little painful, but interesting," said Evan Feagans, who manages the $74 million TCW Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has an 8.5 per cent weighting in Nvidia. "It has been a 'shoot first, ask questions later' kind of response to the DeepSeek news, but I think moves like this create opportunities. I'd expect to hear some of the biggest investors in AI reiterate their AI capital spending outlooks after they report earnings numbers." The selloff follows a week in which investors "aggressively" unloaded holdings in leveraged technology ETFs, said research firm EPFR in its weekly analysis. The firm said these ETFs recorded the second-largest weekly outflow on record, of $1.8 billion, with investors selling $400 million in leveraged Nvidia exposure alone. Data for any outflows from these and other AI-themed ETFs on Monday is not available until Tuesday.

Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.

Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.

AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: The Alarming National Security Implications of DeepSeek and China’s A.I. Breakthrough

Wall Street started the week in a cold sweat thanks to DeepSeek, an obscure Chinese A.I. lab that just dropped a bombshell: a lightning-fast, budget-friendly large language model that’s shaking Silicon Valley to its core. The Hangzhou-based firm claims to have developed it over just two months at a cost under $6 million, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock dropped by more than 15 percent early Monday (Jan. 27). If this newcomer, established in mid-2023, can produce a reliable A.I. model that’s cheaper and faster than existing apps, that’s a stunning blow to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta (META). DeepSeek’s new A.I. app is already available online, including at Apple’s app store, and it’s moving fast. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The timing of this couldn’t be worse for American business, given President Donald Trump’s audacious announcement last week of a new $500 billion initiative termed Stargate AI, involving OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBF) and Oracle, which Trump promised would ensure “the future of technology” for America, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. Has that promising vision already evaporated? It’s too soon to say, but it’s now evident that America and China are in a tight race to harness the power of A.I. for the world. Comparisons to the U.S.-Soviet Cold War “space race” are impossible to miss, and many are comparing DeepSeek’s innovation to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, which shocked Americans with the realization that Moscow reached space before we did. Like Sputnik, DeepSeek’s claimed progress has alarming national security implications. While Wall Street is worried about valuations, the Pentagon is fretting over Chinese advances in A.I. that may give the People’s Liberation Army an edge in warfare. Given how top U.S. military leaders assess that our increasingly open conflict with Beijing may devolve into severe fighting during Trump’s second term, this is no idle threat. The Pentagon’s interest in A.I. and its military implications is hardly new. Five years ago, the Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was expanded to support warfighting plans, not just experiment with new technology. Last year, Craig Martell, the Pentagon’s top A.I. official, pronounced that new technology was revolutionizing how DoD does business. As Martell explained: “Imagine a world where combatant commanders can see everything they need to see to make strategic decisions … Imagine a world where those combatant commanders aren’t getting that information via PowerPoint or via emails from across the [organization] — the turnaround time for situational awareness shrinks from a day or two to ten minutes.” While the vaunted “fog of war” can never be fully lifted, A.I. promises to cut through the haze faster and with a precision never seen in the history of warfare. A.I. will reduce the information burden on military staff with speed and accuracy, enabling a tighter “decision loop” for U.S. generals and admirals. If DeepSeek’s innovation is all it’s being sold as, Beijing may have gained a decisive advantage that will enable the PLA to out-think and outmaneuver the U.S. military in any confrontation in the Western Pacific, most likely over Taiwan. The U.S. Intelligence Community is just as concerned about China’s A.I. progress. In recent years, America’s spy agencies have spent prodigious sums on determining how to harness A.I. to boost the speed and accuracy of intelligence assessments. A.I. can tamp down the “information firehose” that hampers the speedy analysis of complex intelligence problems, employing technology to make human assessments faster and more precise. Last summer, Lakshmi Raman, the Central Intelligence Agency’s top A.I. official, illuminated how this works. “Imagine all of the news stories that come in every minute of every day from around the world. That is also the data that we are neck deep in, and that we’ve got to leverage A.I. in order to help us to triage,” she explained, adding that A.I. was boosting CIA’s clandestine intelligence collection, not just analysis. The National Security Agency, too, has embraced A.I. with gusto, recognizing its game-changing potential for sifting through vast amounts of collected intelligence data to find the puzzle pieces of national security value. NSA is also protecting America from foreign A.I. programs, and the agency recently established the Artificial Intelligence Security Center. As NSA’s Director General Timothy Haugh stated, “When an enterprise runs A.I. systems, it opens up to new attack surfaces in the AI development lifecycle and A.I. abilities in model inference services. We need to secure and protect these systems from threats and buy down risks today.” That threat from foreign A.I. just got a boost with DeepSeek’s claimed progress. The good news here is that nobody’s certain of how real China’s A.I. progress actually is. Communists lie frequently. The Soviet success with Sputnik, boosted by Moscow’s putting Yuri Gagarin in space in 1961, a month before America did the same, proved illusory. The Soviet space program was hampered by quality and safety problems, and despite early Kremlin propaganda feats, America won the space race with the 1969 Moon landing. The bad news is that the clock’s ticking. John R.

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.10%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.62%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA-4.88%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+3.68%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.43%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.04%), Micron (MU+0.19%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.88%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.22%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.60%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA-5.19%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+3.24%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.19%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.07%), Micron (MU+0.06%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-1.05%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. In February 2024, Equinix partnered with NVIDIA to launch a private cloud service, enabling organizations to manage NVIDIA DGX supercomputing infrastructure for developing custom generative AI models. In November 2024, Equinix announced the construction of a sixth International Business Exchange data center in Singapore, named SG6. With an initial investment of $260 million, SG6 will operate on renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive AI workloads. These AI-focused developments have positively impacted the financial performance of the firm. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced increased demand for data center services, driven by an artificial intelligence land grab among tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This surge in demand allowed Equinix to raise rents, with prices for hyperscale tech tenants increasing by 19% during this period. Overall EQIX ranks 26th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Private Credit’s Big Squeeze: How the Arms Race for Scale Is Reshaping the Market
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/private-credit-consolidation-market-impact/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:17:48Z
Full Content:
Private credit is in the midst of an arms race as mega-managers scramble to dominate this booming segment of the asset management industry. BlackRock (BLK)’s announced acquisition of HPS Investment Partners in December—its second manager acquisition of the year—highlights an accelerating consolidation trend that promises both opportunities for the largest funds and potential challenges for the market. In addition, Goldman Sachs (GS)’ recent creation of its Capital Solutions Group, a business unit focused on private credit advisory and investing, and JPMorgan Chase’s partnerships with several private credit firms underscore Wall Street’s largest banks’ determination to capitalize on the growth of private credit. Could this rush of capital to industry giants leave middle-market lenders—and the vital swath of American businesses they serve—starved for capital at a time when traditional bank lending remains constrained? Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. The advantages of economies of scale in asset management are compelling and well-documented. Asset manager revenue is directly tied to the amount of assets under management (AUM). As firms increase AUM, their fixed costs for technology, research and infrastructure can be spread across a larger base, effectively reducing the per-dollar cost of managing client funds. Large asset managers can also negotiate better terms with service providers and counterparties, enabling these firms to develop more sophisticated investment capabilities and risk management systems, which, in theory, can lead to better returns. In addition to scaling AUM, BlackRock’s acquisition of Preqin, a leading private market data vendor, last year highlights its intent to not only grow managed assets but also differentiate its platform by building infrastructure and capabilities that it can vertically integrate into its core investing functions. The benefits of scale, however, may have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. As funds grow in size, deploying capital effectively becomes more challenging—fewer deals are large enough for these firms to allocate capital efficiently. This dynamic creates a consolidation paradox: as private credit managers achieve greater scale, they necessarily focus on mega deals, creating potential market inefficiencies that could undermine the industry’s original purpose. The unprecedented inflow of capital to private credit has spurred the industry’s growth, but with a majority of capital flowing to the largest managers, it’s dramatically widening the gap between the large funds and smaller players. For smaller funds, this shift has been stark. Preqin data shows the 10 largest private credit funds claimed 51 percent of capital raised through the third quarter of 2023, compared to 35 percent for all of 2022. For funds outside of the top 50, the share of capital raised plummeted from 22 percent to 9 percent over the same period. As the largest private credit managers scale, it threatens to create a void in middle-market lending. While a $50 million direct lending deal might fit with a $1 billion AUM fund, it’s inefficient for a fund with several hundred billion dollars in AUM to deploy resources to small deals that would account for a de minimis percent of overall returns. With fewer funds willing to deploy capital to middle-market deals, what happens to these businesses that find themselves with less access to capital? With nearly 200,000 such companies accounting for over one-third of U.S. GDP and employing 48 million people, the potential credit vacuum for these borrowers represents more than just a market inefficiency; it’s a structural challenge that could stifle economic growth and innovation. This consolidation pattern mirrors developments in private equity, where mid-sized firms increasingly find themselves in an existential crisis. As Goldman Sachs’ Mike Brandmeyer recently observed, many PE firms “stuck in the middle” face a stark choice between making significant investments to scale up or selling to larger platforms that already have the necessary infrastructure. With institutional investors showing a clear preference for either the largest or newest managers, this “barbelling” effect is forcing consolidation across alternative assets. This pattern reveals a stark irony in the industry’s evolution. The private credit industry was primarily borne out as a response to post-financial crisis regulations that made it costly for banks to serve smaller, riskier borrowers. Yet, as private credit managers consolidate and scale, they appear to follow a similar path to the banks they initially sought to replace, prioritizing larger, more profitable clients at the expense of smaller businesses. For small and mid-sized managers, the changing landscape demands strategic adaptation. Some are finding success through sector specialization or by building stronger regional relationships. Others are exploring partnerships or technological solutions as alternatives to traditional scale advantages. The non-sponsored deal market, or direct lending, where competition tends to be less intense, offers another avenue for differentiation. Specifically, according to the IMF, about 70 percent of private credit deals go to sponsor-backed companies, leaving a significant opportunity for managers to capitalize on direct lending transactions. While requiring more intensive origination efforts, these direct-to-company relationships can offer attractive economics and deeper borrower relationships compared to sponsor-backed deals, as lenders aren’t competing with multiple sponsors’ existing lending relationships. While private credit operating outside the traditional banking system limits the systemic risk imposed on the overall financial system, their interconnectedness and substantial market share naturally raise questions about market stability and contagion risk during periods of stress. For example, stress at any single major private credit player could have outsized effects on market stability and credit availability to both large and mid-sized businesses The future of private credit will be defined by those who can balance scale with efficiency. Mega-managers must find ways to serve smaller borrowers without sacrificing efficiency, while mid-sized players need to lean into specialization and innovation to stay relevant. Ultimately, the winners will be those who can adapt without losing sight of the industry’s original mission—filling the credit gaps that banks left behind. Banks are increasingly partnering with private credit funds to provide their commercial clients with alternative financing options when traditional bank loans aren’t feasible—a sign of how the market is adapting to serve borrower needs. The private credit market’s continued evolution will test whether these innovations can effectively balance the advantages of scale with the necessity of serving a diverse borrower base.

Title: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is rattling markets. Here's what to know
URL: https://qz.com/china-ai-startup-deepseek-r1-v3-openai-reasoning-model-1851748222
Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:15:00Z
Full Content:
A Chinese artificial intelligence startup is rattling Silicon Valley and Wall Street after it demonstrated AI models on par with OpenAI’s — for a fraction of the cost and energy. At just over a year old, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released results for its latest open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week. The models showed a comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks. In December, DeepSeek released a different model that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia H800 chips, which have reduced capabilities compared to chips used by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips from Nvidia (NVDA-4.88%). The release of DeepSeek-R1 has sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Here’s what to know about DeepSeek and its AI models. The Chinese AI startup was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of Chinese quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer Capital Management. DeepSeek was reportedly formed out of High-Flyer’s AI research unit to focus on developing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which is when AI reaches human-level intelligence. DeepSeek develops open-source models, which means developers have access to and can work on its software. DeepSeek introduced its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, last week. DeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained by large-scale reinforcement learning and without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek said. The model “demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities,” but has challenges with “poor readability” and mixing language, according to the startup. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, has surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-0.62%) App Store downloads, while the DeepSeek site is experiencing outages from an influx of new users. The startup announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, prompting a temporary limit on registrations. The chatbot was powered by DeepSeek-V3, which DeepSeek said performed comparably with Meta’s (META-0.10%) Llama 3.1 and OpenAI’s 4o at its release in December. Unlike ChatGPT and its other chatbot competitors, DeepSeek explains its “reasoning” before responding to inquiries. However, the Chinese-developed chatbot does not directly answer prompts about politically sensitive topics such as President Xi Jinping or Taiwan. According to DeepSeek, R1 performed comparably with OpenAI’s and Meta’s models on leading benchmarks such as the AIME 2024, which tests mathematics, and the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) which evaluates general knowledge. On the community-driven Chatbot Arena leaderboard, DeepSeek-R1 comes in under Google’s (GOOGL-0.06%) Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model and ChatGPT-4o. DeepSeek-V3, meanwhile, fell just below OpenAI’s o1-preview and full o1 models. Meta, which also develops open-source models, is reportedly concerned that the next version of its flagship Llama will fall behind DeepSeek’s models. Specialized groups of researchers at Meta are looking into DeepSeek’s models for ways to improve the next Llama model, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Nvidia’s business, which relies on major AI firms such as OpenAI, Meta, and Google spending billions of dollars on its GPUs. In a technical report for its V3 model, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta, for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. Last week, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the tech giant is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025. He added that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year, and that the company plans to “build an AI engineer” that can contribute more code to its research and development efforts. Meanwhile, OpenAI, SoftBank (SFTBY-0.96%), and Oracle (ORCL-1.33%) recently announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan with the Trump administration called Stargate. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Aside from prompting questions about AI chip spending, DeepSeek’s success challenges U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country. According to its technical report, DeepSeek used Nvidia’s H800 chips for its V3 model, which are a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100s that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. Before leaving office earlier this month, the Biden administration introduced even more measures focused on keeping AI chips out of China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from advanced semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development. Under the rules, foundries and packaging companies that want to export certain chips are subject to a broader license requirement unless certain conditions are met. The U.S. also published new guidelines aimed at curbing AI chip sales from U.S. firms, including Nvidia, to specific countries and companies. The new export controls include three tiers of chip restrictions, which give friendly nations full access to U.S.-made chips but add new limitations to others.

What's happened and is happening in and around Los Angeles is a disaster of staggering proportions. You have tens of thousands of folks who are displaced, many who no longer have a home, and it's not like there are homes to spare in that part of the country. So what these fire victims are facing is not only finding shelter, but figuring out where they're going to eventually live. And that's getting more and more complex because insurance companies are pulling out of a lot of these climate change crisis zones, right? Caitlin Constantine: Right. We've seen Florida, California, and Louisiana all have challenges with keeping insurers for a variety of reasons, but underpinning all of this is the fact that climate-related disasters are becoming more common, more extreme, and more costly. So let's take California. Over the past few years, California has actually seen several major insurers like Allstate, State Farm, and Farmers either stop writing new home insurance policies or decline to renew other policies. In fact, in July, State Farm dropped about 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades alone. Insurers say that the cost of paying for wildfire losses has been greater than what they were able to collect in premiums, so they chose to reduce how much they were covering in the state instead of continuing to take those losses. Sean Pyles: And just last month, California's insurance commissioner released new rules that were supposed to bolster the insurance market in the state. Where might that play out in this recovery effort? Caitlin Constantine: So these new regulations require insurers to write more home insurance policies in areas with high risk of wildfire. In exchange, those insurers can make changes in how they set their rates, and that's likely going to result in higher premiums. To put it simply, more California homeowners will likely have access to home insurance, but they're going to have to pay more for it. The regulations may be starting to work as intended, as some insurers have recently announced that they would resume business in the state. But that said, we don't know how the wildfires are going to impact this. Now, it's also worth noting that there's a one-year moratorium on dropping home insurance policies in the areas affected by the LA wildfires. The California Insurance Commissioner also called on insurance companies to rescind non-renewals that were issued in the 90 days before the wildfires and to also cancel pending non-renewals. These moves should help homeowners maintain coverage when they begin to rebuild after the fires. Sara Rathner: But this isn't a new story, is it? We've seen this happening all over the country. You already mentioned Florida, California, Louisiana. We also saw storms in Western North Carolina this summer and all these places that have gone through enormous tragedy. These extreme weather events end up jacking up insurance prices. Caitlin Constantine: Sadly, it's becoming more and more common. We've been seeing home insurance costs increase around the country as extreme weather becomes more destructive and happens more frequently. And it's not just the usual suspects like Florida, Louisiana, and California. Last month, the Senate Budget Committee released a report on climate change and insurance that indicated parts of Southern New England, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and the Carolinas may not be far behind. That report also warns that if these trends continue, we're going to start to see this impact property values. Sean Pyles: Caitlin, I know you have some personal experience with this issue. You live in Asheville, North Carolina, where Hurricane Helene brought so much destruction last fall. What have you seen in insurance rates in the wake of natural disasters that hit where you live? Caitlin Constantine: Well, it's a little soon for us to know how much our premiums will go up, but we do know that last week North Carolina's Insurance Commissioner approved an average rate of increase of about 15% across the state that will take effect by the middle of next year. So it's safe to say that many of us are going to pay more for home insurance. I will say that one thing we do know for sure posed a huge problem for us: a lack of flood insurance. So standard home insurance doesn't cover flood damage. You have to have flood insurance specifically for that. In an analysis done by a local nonprofit news group, Asheville Watchdog, they found that less than 1% of the buildings in Buncombe County, which is where Asheville is located, were covered by flood insurance. So that means that a significant number of people who lost homes and businesses when the French Broad River flooded will not have nearly enough money to rebuild. And Asheville's not alone in this regard. A new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that people who live near inland rivers and streams are more likely to go without flood insurance than people who live near the coast. And unfortunately, the report also found that people who live near rivers tend to have fewer resources to recover than do people who live near coasts. Sara Rathner: I think it's sometimes easy for people to think, "Well, I don't live in an area that's threatened by these kinds of events, so this insurance discussion isn't relevant to me." But it actually is. Can you tell us about how the insurance losses from disasters that might even be far from where you live end up being paid for by all of us? Caitlin Constantine: Well, it's important to remember that the point of insurance is to spread the cost of recovering and rebuilding over a wider group of people instead of expecting individuals to shoulder those costs entirely on their own. And so it follows that when more of us file bigger claims more frequently, the pool of money we're being paid out from has to increase as well, and that's when premiums go up. I think it's an indicator of the scope of this problem that the cost of paying for weather-related damage has become so high that the increase is being felt even in places that don't see a lot of extreme weather. Sara Rathner: Can you give us a sense of how much more everyone is paying because of these rolling crises? Caitlin Constantine: Well, we've been seeing home insurance rates increase almost across the board for a few years now. Partly that's been due to inflation, but partly it's due to the aforementioned increase in severe weather. In 2023, premiums increased by more than 11%, according to S&P Global. And then in 2024, our average rate for home insurance in the U.S. was $160 a month or a little over $1,900 a year, and that was calculated before the most recent disasters in L.A., Florida, and North Carolina. So we're getting ready to do our analysis for the upcoming year, and we fully expect to see rates go up once again. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about what all of this means for the cost of housing in this country. How do insurance costs play into the rising price you have to pay for a house or even to rent? Caitlin Constantine: Well, in recent years, insurance premiums have become so costly for so many people that they now are paying more for insurance and taxes than for the mortgage itself. And this is yet another factor that's making homeownership unaffordable for so many people, especially first-time buyers. It's not just that the house itself has become so much more expensive, but it's also much more expensive to insure it. And if you have a mortgage, you can't go without insurance. Plus, it's no longer a predictable expense, as so many of us have seen big increases in our home insurance year over year. So even if you can swing the expense one year, who knows if you're going to be able to manage it three or four years down the road? And renters, this is going to impact you as well. Your landlord is going to end up paying more to insure that property, and those costs will be passed down to you. Sean Pyles: Let's get to some practical advice for folks who are facing, or very well could face in the future, some soaring insurance bills for their homes. Caitlin, can you give us three or four top things people can do right now to try to lower those bills? Caitlin Constantine: So first of all, if you get hit with a big insurance bill, you definitely should shop around for a new policy. We recommend getting quotes from at least three insurers. You can start on our site. If you do a search for NerdWallet home insurance quotes, you'll get a page and you can get started by entering your zip code on the page that comes up. When you are getting quotes, it's really important to make sure that the quotes have comparable levels of coverage so that you are measuring apples to apples. If insurance is scarce in your area, which it very well could be, your best bet is going to be working with an independent insurance agent. They will know about all of the good insurers who sell in your area, not just the ones with the big ad budgets or the goofy mascots. And another money-saving tactic is raising your deductible. We've found that if you raise your deductible from $1,000 to $2,500, you can save on average nearly 13% on your premium. But if you do this, it's super important to make sure you can cover that expense. And really, it's important that you make sure you read your policy carefully. You might have a separate deductible for hail or wind damage. In fact, your policy is going to have all kinds of details about possible exclusions or limitations, so it's really critical to read it and make sure you understand it. One thing we don't recommend doing to save money is reducing how much coverage you have. It may be tempting to save money by lowering your coverage limits, but if disaster strikes, you're going to be very glad you're not underinsured. Sean Pyles: Caitlin Constantine, thank you so much for helping us out today. Caitlin Constantine: Thanks so much for having me. Sara Rathner: In a moment, we'll turn to this episode's money question segment, where we help you dig into whether high-yield savings accounts live up to the hype or if other types of savings accounts might be better for you. Sean Pyles: But before we get into that, we're going to ask you, nerdy listener, to pause — literally perhaps — to think about where you need some guidance with your money. Sara Rathner: Maybe you're wondering about how to compare different insurance companies, or you're trying to break yourself out of a bad financial habit but just can't seem to do it. Whatever your money question, we Nerds are here to help. Leave us a voicemail or text us on the Nerd hotline at 901-730-6373. That's 901-730-NERD. Or email us at [email protected]. Sean Pyles: And a reminder that one of our goals on Smart Money this year is to talk with more of you live on the podcast to help you with your money questions. If you want to hang out with Sara and me for a bit and get some nerdy wisdom, let us know. One more time, leave us a voicemail or text us on the Nerd hotline at 901-730-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D. And you can always email us at [email protected]. Sara Rathner: All right, let's get to this episode's money question segment. That's up next. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: We're back and answering your money questions to help you make smarter financial decisions. This episode's question comes from Aaron, who sent us an email. Here it is: "Hi, NerdWallet team. I wanted to reach out and share some thoughts on the topic I know you cover often, high-yield savings accounts. As someone who invests across platforms primarily with Vanguard, I have noticed that their Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, while requiring a $3,000 minimum, consistently offers a higher annual return than most high-yield savings accounts. This raises a question in my mind. Aside from the convenience of short-term liquidity for bill payments or direct deposits, is there much advantage to high-yield savings accounts? The money market fund has no cap on purchases, is FDIC insured, and currently offers a 4.78% yield, which seems to outshine high-yield savings accounts for similar security." Sara Rathner: Aaron continues: "Thinking a bit deeper, it seems that financial institutions heavily market high-yield savings accounts, yet these often come in half a percent to 1% lower than similar money market funds. From what I see, this setup is quite profitable for banks. They enjoy liquidity from deposits while offering a quote-unquote high yield that still nets them a solid margin with minimal risk. High-yield savings accounts essentially allow institutions to secure a consistent return without needing to invest actively — a profit margin they might not achieve with conventional investment accounts. Given your expertise in high-yield savings, I'd love to hear your perspective. Do you agree with this assessment, and if so, why are high-yield accounts marketed as a beneficial product for the average saver?" To help us answer Aaron's question on this episode of the podcast, we are joined by Margarette Burnette. Margarette is a savings expert who has been writing about bank accounts for more than a decade. Her work has been featured in the Associated Press, USA Today, and other major media. Margarette, welcome to Smart Money. Margarette Burnette: Thank you for having me. I'm glad to be here. Sean Pyles: Hey Margarette. So let's start with the basics. What is the difference between a high-yield savings account and a money market account? Let's start with the money market account. What is it and where and how do you get one? Margarette Burnette: This is a great question, Sean, and I'm happy to answer it. But there is a point I'd like to clear up first in the terminology, because money market means different things depending on the context. So a money market mutual fund, like the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, is an investment product. It's offered by a brokerage, not a bank. As a mutual fund, it pools investors' money into low-risk, short-term securities. So think government securities such as Treasury bills. This fund is not FDIC-insured. That's the key difference. A money market deposit account, on the other hand, is a bank product. It is a savings account that can sometimes come with check-writing features, but importantly, it is FDIC-insured. This means your money is protected by the federal government, and you can open one at a bank. Sean Pyles: And a high-yield savings account — this might seem obvious, especially because we do talk about them a lot on this show — but let's define those as well. Margarette Burnette: A high-yield savings account is also a bank product. It's simply a savings account that pays above-average rates. For example, the national average rate for savings accounts is currently less than half a percentage point, but you can find high-yield savings accounts that offer more than 4% annually. Also, like the money market deposit account, high-yield savings accounts are FDIC-insured, so your money is safe. Sara Rathner: Let's talk about this question of returns or interest that you would earn on money that you deposit in both of these types of accounts: money market deposit accounts — which is really just a type of savings account — and high-yield savings accounts, which of course are another type of savings account. Again, the listener was conflating money market deposit accounts with money market mutual funds. That’s a type of investment account. It's very different. So where do returns come from in a money market deposit account? Margarette Burnette: With money market deposit accounts, returns are based on interest rates set by the bank. They are generally tied to something called the federal funds rate, and rates can change at any time. That said, when you make your deposit, you typically know the rate you can expect, at least as of the day you make that deposit. Sara Rathner: And what about high-yield savings accounts — or really any savings accounts? Margarette Burnette: High-yield savings accounts work the same way as money market deposit accounts. Interest rates are set by banks and can change based on their market environment. Again, these are both different from money market mutual funds. Their returns are based on the performance of the securities the funds invest in, like Treasury bills, and these returns are called a yield. It's worth noting that future returns in a mutual fund are not guaranteed. Sean Pyles: So let's look at Aaron's example here. What would they want to think about when looking at these options for placing their money? Margarette Burnette: Here are a few things to think about. First, fees and minimum balances. You can find high-yield savings accounts that don't charge monthly fees and don't have minimum balance requirements. Money market mutual funds may charge an expense ratio, which is essentially a fee for the fund, and they may also have minimum balance requirements, as Aaron noted above. Next is your returns, of course. The higher your yield or the more interest you earn in the savings account, the faster your balance can grow. And finally, you'll want to think about access to your money. With savings accounts, if you have an ATM card, you may be able to go to an ATM machine and withdraw money instantly, or you could set up an automatic transfer that can be sent to a linked account within a day or so. Money market deposit accounts — those savings accounts — work similarly, with some giving you the ability to write a few checks each month. Sean Pyles: And now what about money market mutual funds? If someone does decide to put their money into one of these investment accounts, is getting your money from one of those accounts as easy as getting it from a money market deposit account or a high-yield savings account? Margarette Burnette: Some money market mutual funds do let you write checks as well, but there may be a minimum withdrawal requirement. Otherwise, to access your money, you may need to sell shares, and that could take a day or two to settle. I'll note that the savings accounts and money market deposit accounts with the highest rates do tend to be online accounts. So going to a local bank branch to withdraw money usually isn't an option, so you'll want to take that into account when making a decision about which one to open. Sean Pyles: Fortunately, our job here at NerdWallet is to make decisions like this easier. So I do want to mention that we have articles on the best high-yield savings accounts and the best money market deposit accounts on NerdWallet's website. You can check the NerdWallet rating, the APY, and any relevant bonus offers for each account, along with some of that other information we just talked about, like minimum balances and fees. And if you want, you can also look up money market mutual funds as well. We'll put links to those articles in today's show notes. Sara Rathner: Aaron also talks about what they think is behind the differences in the rates being offered. They think it's about profitability. Could you talk us through why a bank would be marketing or offering one versus the other? Margarette Burnette: Here's an important distinction. Banks market deposit products like checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market deposit accounts — they're FDIC insured for customers. Investment companies, on the other hand, market money market mutual funds. To be fair, these mutual funds are considered low-risk investments, but they don't come with insurance or guaranteed returns. Also, I should point out that some banks have investment arms, so it's possible to see both types of products under a similar brand. But the bank side would not market a mutual fund, and the investment side would not market a deposit product. Sean Pyles: And let's talk a bit about the role of FDIC insurance here. Can you lay that out for us, Margarette? Margarette Burnette: FDIC insurance is a safety net that guarantees your bank deposits up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. So even if the bank goes under, your money is protected. Now, there are regulations for mutual funds, but funds don't have that FDIC guarantee. Sean Pyles: And again, to get back to Aaron's question, it seems like they're making this apples-to-oranges comparison. They say they can get a return of 4.78% on their investment account, while savings accounts may offer a yield of closer to around 4% as of this recording. I want to quickly state that each account would serve a different purpose. It's generally not a great idea to have your savings in an investment account in case you do need to draw on that money in an emergency. Margarette Burnette: In general, I'd suggest folks poke around with a savings calculator to see how much you could earn with a rate of 4.5%, for example, compared with a rate of, say, 5% or 4%. Depending on how much money you have in your account, an account with a slightly higher rate may not net you that much more. Sean Pyles: So the lesson here is to do a bit of research to find those higher returns for yourself. They could go in either direction with these options. Margarette Burnette: Absolutely. This is especially true when you consider any fees that could be taken out of your returns with the money market mutual fund, for example. Sara Rathner: Do you have any other final advice for our listeners as they chase higher returns in an environment where interest rates are coming down, but sometimes they're faced with products that sound like they're the same thing but are actually completely different things? Margarette Burnette: That's very true. A couple of different issues here, and my answer to both is to shop around. It's not a given that money market mutual funds — which, again, are investment accounts — always offer better results than the best high-yield savings accounts. You'll want to check out up-to-date lists of the top high-yield savings accounts and money market deposit accounts because you may find some that offer better rates compared to the yields on money market mutual funds. In addition, if you know you won't need the money right away, you can consider looking at a certificate of deposit. If rates fall, then locking in today's CD rates could ultimately give you a better yield than all of the previous options. The key is you generally won't be able to make a withdrawal with CDs until the term is over. So, say for a one-year CD, you'd agree not to make a withdrawal for one year. Overall, depending on your goals, a CD, a high-yield savings account, money market deposit account, or money market mutual fund could be the right choice. Sean Pyles: Margarette, thank you so much for coming on and clarifying all these different accounts and who they might be best for. Margarette Burnette: Thank you.

Title: Bitcoin's DeepSeek-Triggered Selloff Is a Buy the Dip Opportunity, Analysts Say

Crypto assets saw a panicky decline overnight alongside a Nvidia-led tech stock plunge on DeepSeek's more efficient artificial intelligence model. With bitcoin (BTC) at one point sliding from a Sunday high of $105,000 to below $98,000 before bouncing back to its current level just below $100,000, some analysts warned this could be the start of an even deeper pullback. Among those taking the other side of that trade is Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered Bank. "Buy the dip," he said in a Monday morning report. Kendrick one week ago warned of a potential 10%-20% correction thanks to markets having priced in overzealous expectations of Trump's crypto executive order and strategic reserve. The overnight selloff, he argued, likely took care of much of this. While there might be some more pain ahead this week with U.S. big tech companies reporting earnings this week and the Federal Reserve's January meeting results Wednesday, Kendrick took note of the rapid decline in U.S. Treasury yields — the 10-year note yield now nearing 4.5% — as signaling much of the downward move is done. Despite there not being much near-term price boost from the Trump administration's digital asset actions, the benefits should ripple through the sector over the next weeks and months through boosted institutional asset flows. LondonCryptoClub analysts hit a similar note, seeing the crypto selloff as a knee-jerk reaction to a headline event. "The Deepseek FUD [fear, uncertainty, doubt] is a classic shoot first, ask questions later," LondonCryptoClub analysts said. "Flushes like these amidst a still constructive fundamental macro story that typically mark local lows in a bull trend." "Be careful today as a broad derisking can be very mechanical and indiscriminate," they added. "But this is very much a BTFD [buy the **** dip] market still." Bitcoin at press time was trading down more than 4% over the past 24 hours at $99,800. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was lower by 3%, led by 15% decline for Nvidia (NVDA).

Title: The Nvidia rout sends CEO Jensen Huang's net worth plummeting $18 billion

Time Published: 2025-01-27T16:45:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA-4.88%) CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth plunged $18 billion Monday as the chipmaker’s stock continues to free fall. Huang was worth $106.3 billion as of Monday morning, down nearly 15%, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Huang has an approximately 3% stake in Nvidia. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 16% to around $120 apiece just before mid-day. The rout caused the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization to fall by more than $465 billion to $2.97 trillion — the biggest single-day decline in market value for a company, beating its own previous record set last September. That drop puts it below Apple (AAPL-0.62%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.67%) as the third-most valuable company in the world. Just last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Global technology stocks suffered a widespread sell-off Monday that sent all three major U.S. indices tumbling, after investors grew concerned over a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML+3.68%), Broadcom (AVGO-1.43%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.04%), Micron (MU+0.19%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM-0.88%). The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 600 points, or roughly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, were also down more than 70 points, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.10%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” However, they noted that the DeepSeek threat isn’t yet cause for concern, as U.S. companies remain ahead of the curve to achieving the next frontier of AI development: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

Title: The Scoop: As Trump admin flexes muscle, Target retreats from DEI

Target is the latest national brand to announce plans to roll back long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a memo to employees, Target announced plans to end its three-year DEI goals and stop reporting to external groups focused on diversity, such as the Human Rights Campaign. The memo noted that Target will no longer support an internal program aimed at carrying more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. These changes won’t lead to any layoffs, CNBC reported. But it’s already impacting the ways Target is interacting with the community. “Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,” Kiera Fernandez, chief community impact and equity officer at Target, wrote in the memo. “And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future – all in service of driving Target’s growth and winning together.” Target is certainly not alone in its decision-making. Companies such as Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meta and McDonald’s have also scaled back or stopped their DEI commitments amid growing political and societal pressures. Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump ended the government’s DEI programs and placed federal officials in charge of those initiatives on leave. But not all companies are following this trend. For example, Costco recently voted overwhelmingly to continue supporting its DEI programs, with over 98% of shareholders rejecting a proposal to review its DEI risks. Why it matters: This is a moment of sea change as monumental as what we saw when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and organizations across the country adopted DEI measures as a way of addressing historical inequities in business. To be clear, these changes have been evolving for some time, with a variety of companies slowly scaling back DEI efforts. Then came the Supreme Court decision rolling back affirmative action, which gave some legal cover for halting these programs. Then came societal pressure from activists including Robbie Starbuck. Then, with the election of Donald Trump, the pressures moved from cultural to governmental, with the feds threatening to investigate companies engaging in DEI in ways it deems “illegal.” This is a delicate moment that requires careful balancing. This is not an issue any one department or communicator can tackle. Legal, HR, internal and external communications must all collaborate to determine what is legal, what is just and how those items should be communicated. Target and Costco are one example of companies handling this very differently. Target, which had already been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ protests, retreated from DEI. Costco stood in its principles. Behind each decision, surely, were many agonized conversations, disagreements and lawyers. Your role as a communicator is to be the voice of your audiences. To show the data on their needs and how that may impact the business. This will be a difficult moment regardless of what your organization decides to do. Listen. Advocate in the best interests of the organization and your audiences. That sometimes is the more important role than any official statement.

Title: Trump Can Win Again—Advancing Carbon Capture For 2025

WA Parish plant infrastructure at Fort Bend County. NGR Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration ... [+] Corporation built the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project. The project is a commercial-scale carbon capture system that captures carbon dioxide in the processed flue gas from an existing unit at the WA Parish power plant. Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016, in Houston. ( Marie D. De Jesus / Houston Chronicle ) (Photo by Marie D. De Jesus/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) The first Trump administration had a better record in carbon capture by allowing states to approve permits for carbon dioxide injection wells. There is no reason not to give consumers what they want to buy. The second Trump administration should reverse Biden’s EPA carbon capture policy to guarantee U.S. energy dominance. Polls show that a majority of Americans, including Texans, want a lower emissions future. Carbon capture is a primary tool in the emissions reduction portfolio, and the major oil companies are leading the way by investing billions of dollars in capital and jobs to offset not only their own emissions but their customers’ emissions. The Biden administration did not pursue a forward thinking policy with carbon capture and left office not only with dozens of Class VI carbon dioxide injection well applications still pending but the applications by oil producing states to take over the well permitting task from the federal government. The Biden administration’s attitude was that approving carbon capture projects by oil companies only facilitated further use of fossil fuels. This hostility towards the oil industry was counterproductive and set back efforts to lower emissions by four years. Carbon capture projects are underway in a dozen states. The earliest began in Terrell, Texas, in 1972 with the captured carbon dioxide injected being used for EOR, enhanced oil recovery, and most operating carbon capture projects today are paired with EOR projects. More recent projects reclaim the waste carbon dioxide to produce ethanol for applications in fuels, vodka, hand sanitizers, and perfume. The world is decades away from eliminating fossil fuels. Oil and gas production in Africa is driving economic development there and with it, the reduced mortality rates that will be the largest contributor to an expected global population growth of 2 billion people over the next 30 years. While it is obvious that they will not all drive SUVs, they will have electricity, communications, healthcare, and mass transit. The question now becomes, will the U.S. continue its energy dominance with solutions to the emissions problem? Occidental Petroleum and BlackRock have combined forces to build the world’s largest Direct Air Capture project in Ector County, Texas. The STRATOS project will begin operation later this year. Shell is pursuing carbon capture projects in the U.K., Canada, and in Deer Park, Texas. Chevron is operating carbon sequestration facilities in Australia and California. BP is researching sequestration in Indiana, where Archer Daniels Midlands already operates a Class VI injection well. ExxonMobil operates a 1,500 mile network of CO2 pipelines for EOR, industrial use, and storage—currently 9 million metric tons per year—with a completed well in East Texas and an offshore lease of 270,000 acres in Texas for storage. States are leading the energy transition. In Texas, the installed capacity of wind farms and solar farms is greater than that of natural gas power plants because the state’s elected leaders accommodated the growth. The Texas pipeline of wind and solar projects under construction means that renewable electricity will become the dominant supply in a matter of months. And if the Trump EPA grants primacy to the states for approvals of Class VI carbon injection wells, the states will be able to accommodate the pent-up demand for carbon capture. The Trump administration is a fan of market solutions, and these long-term carbon capture investments are led by domestic and foreign private capital. State and federal support via subsidies and tax breaks are helpful but certainly not the primary catalyst. Complaining about these supports invites comparisons to the oil industry’s tax subsidies and does not contribute to the discussion of advancing a proven solution. It is counter-productive to stand in the way of a demonstrated market with willing buyers and willing sellers already in place. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: What is DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that shook the tech world? | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/tech/deepseek-ai-explainer/index.html
Time Published: 2025-01-27T15:44:05Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A surprisingly efficient and powerful Chinese AI model has taken the technology industry by storm. It’s called DeepSeek R1, and it’s rattling nerves on Wall Street. The new AI model was developed by DeepSeek, a startup that was born just a year ago and has somehow managed a breakthrough that famed tech investor Marc Andreessen has called “AI’s Sputnik moment”: R1 can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million powering its base AI model, compared with the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That’s even more shocking when considering that the United States has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips. The company, founded in late 2023 by Chinese hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, is one of scores of startups that have popped up in recent years﻿ seeking big investment to ride the massive AI wave that has taken the tech industry to new heights. Liang has become the Sam Altman of China — an evangelist for AI technology and investment in new research. His hedge fund, High-Flyer, focuses on AI development. Like other AI startups, including Anthropic and Perplexity, DeepSeek released various competitive AI models over the past year that have captured some industry attention. Its V3 model raised some awareness about the company, although its content restrictions around sensitive topics about the Chinese government and its leadership sparked doubts about its viability as an industry competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported. But R1, which came out of nowhere when it was revealed late last year, launched last week and gained significant attention this week when the company revealed to the Journal its shockingly low cost of operation. And it is open-source, which means other companies can test and build upon the model to improve it. The DeepSeek app has surged on the app store charts, surpassing ChatGPT Monday, and it has been downloaded nearly 2 million times. AI is a power-hungry and cost-intensive technology — so much so that America’s most powerful tech leaders are buying up nuclear power companies to provide the necessary electricity for their AI models. Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of high-in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models. So the notion that similar capabilities as America’s most powerful AI models can be achieved for such a small fraction of the cost — and on less capable chips — represents a sea change in the industry’s understanding of how much investment is needed in AI. The technology has many skeptics and opponents, but its advocates promise a bright future: AI will advance the global economy into a new era, they argue, making work more efficient and opening up new capabilities across multiple industries that will pave the way for new research and developments. Andreessen, a Trump supporter and co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X. If that potentially world-changing power can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost, it opens up new possibilities — and threats — to the planet. The United States thought it could sanction its way to dominance in a key technology it believes will help bolster its national security. Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden doubled down on export restrictions on AI computer chips to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology. But DeepSeek has called into question that notion, and threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. America may have bought itself time with restrictions on chip exports, but its AI lead just shrank dramatically despite those actions. DeepSeek may show that turning off access to a key technology doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will win. That’s an important message to President Donald Trump as he pursues his isolationist “America First” policy. Wall Street was alarmed by the development. US stocks were set for a steep selloff Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock more than doubled in each of the past two years, fell 12% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply, as were Marvell, Broadcom, Palantir, Oracle and many other tech giants. The industry is taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. The company notably didn’t say how much it cost to train its model, leaving out potentially expensive research and development costs. (Still, it probably didn’t spend billions of dollars.) It’s also far too early to count out American tech innovation and leadership. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending),” said Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “Ultimately, our view, is the required spend for data and such in AI will be significant, and US companies remain leaders.” Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor — a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that — for now — still require tremendous infrastructure investments. “Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.

Title: Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Today

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

HANGZHOU, CHINA - JANUARY 27, 2025 - A Illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia LOGO in Hangzhou ... [+] City, Zhejiang Province, China, January 27, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) A few weeks ago, Chinese AI research lab DeepSeek released its open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which has drawn significant attention in the tech world. According to a paper authored by the lab, the DeepSeek-R1 model outperforms cutting-edge models such as OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama AI models across multiple benchmarks. This is impressive, given that the model is also open-source, cost-effective, and requires significantly less computational power compared to its rivals. Now DeepSeek’s approach appears to have set off alarm bells in Silicon Valley, where most big tech giants have been relying more on brute force — amassing a larger stock of GPU chips and servers and running long model training periods. We believe this development could potentially have implications for Nvidia stock, the dominant player in the AI hardware space. Also, check out our analysis on: How Nvidia stock could drop 50%. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency. Although the company apparently utilizes tens of thousands of Nvidia’s H100 and H200 AI GPUs to train its models, it has faced constraints due to U.S. export controls limiting access to the latest chips. To overcome this, DeepSeek has implemented innovative engineering tweaks, such as custom communication schemes between chips to improve data transfer efficiency, memory-saving techniques, and reinforcement learning methods to minimize computational power requirements. These optimizations result in drastically lower costs compared to traditional large language models. Separately, up 45% in a week? See: What’s Happening With Tempus AI (TEM) Stock? This cost efficiency is reflected in the API pricing for DeepSeek-R1, which costs just $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.19 per million output tokens — significantly undercutting OpenAI’s API rates of $15 and $60, respectively. However, it remains unclear how quickly DeepSeek can expand its reach. The company’s commercial ambitions could face challenges due to the U.S. chip ban. More importantly, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China could create trust issues for companies considering using Chinese-built large language models. These factors could limit DeepSeek’s penetration in Western markets. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. That being said, we believe that DeepSeek’s advancements could prompt a moment of reckoning for big tech companies. DeepSeek’s resource-efficient methods could force a reconsideration of brute-force AI strategies that rely on massive investments in computing power. Nvidia has been the largest beneficiary of this approach through the AI boom, with its GPUs regarded as the best performing for training and deploying AI models. Over the past two years, companies have funneled massive resources into building AI models, driving Nvidia’s revenue up by over 125% in fiscal year 2024 to $61 billion, with net margins nearing 50%. If the industry begins to take inspiration from the methods DeepSeek uses in its open-source models, we could very well see demand for AI Computing power cool off. The underlying economics of the broader AI ecosystem have been weak in the first place, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments. This could accelerate the shift toward more cost-effective, resource-optimized AI models. Now the increase in NVDA stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We see a possibility that the “fear-of-missing-out” driven AI wave seen over the last two years could ease off due to diminishing incremental performance gains from larger models and also as the availability of high-quality training data becomes a bottleneck. This shift toward more efficient models could compound the impact of a potential slowdown for GPU makers such as Nvidia. Moreover, Nvidia also faces mounting competition from the likes of AMD as well as its own customers such as Amazon, who have been focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. While Nvidia does have a comprehensive software ecosystem around its AI processors, including programming languages that should help it better lock customers into its products, the company could face pressure. Nvidia’s premium valuation may not fully reflect these risks. We value Nvidia stock at about $93 per share, roughly 35% below the current market price.

Title: U.S. Retail Sales Projected to Increase by 4% in 2025, Reaching $5.2 Trillion Amid Economic Challenges

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Bain & Co. report details strategic resolutions for retailers, while also highlighting growth in non-store sales. Executive Editor According to a research report from the retail team at Bain & Co., nominal U.S. retail sales are pegged to see a 4 percent increase, year-over-year, in 2025 — “barring major macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks,” the firm noted. The report also included “resolutions” that successful retailers are focusing on this year. “That equates to around $5.2 trillion in estimated total sales in 2025,” the authors of the report said. “It’s a strong outlook, given a stagnant consumer outlook, tempering inflation, negative [year-over-year] employment trends, diminishing consumer savings, rising credit card delinquencies, elevated nondiscretionary costs and potential trade disruptions.” Related Articles Technology Retail C-Suite to Boost AI Investment Amid Growing Adoption, Workforce Readiness Concerns Interior Design EXCLUSIVE: Interior Designer Nina Magon on Becoming a Global Brand The Bain advisers said they expect growth will be fueled by a 10 percent increase in non-store sales, “while in-store sales will see modest 2 percent gains, led by general merchandise, apparel, and health and personal care stores.” You May Also Like The report was written and compiled by Bain partners Aaron Cheris, Kurt Grichel, Marc-André Kamel and Darrell Rigby as well as Stephanie Koszyk, practice director. “Retailers face a pivotal moment in 2025,” the report’s authors said. “The challenges of shifting consumer behaviors and demands, economic volatility, regulatory changes and trade complexities persist, reshaping the retail game. Successful businesses will go beyond the familiar, tapping into cutting-edge technologies, reimagining loyalty programs and fortifying supply chains against an unpredictable global backdrop.” The report said that while headwinds remain, “opportunities such as potential interest rate cuts, tax incentives and momentum from a strong 2024 holiday season suggest 2025 may be a year in which innovative moves can set the stage for lasting success.” Regarding resolutions for success, the Bain report said companies should take cues from “scale players” such as Walmart and Amazon (with large assortments, along with Costco). The report’s authors said these brands “have become the go-to for many shoppers, accounting for 57 percent of retail growth over the last three quarters and 17 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2024 — a 6-percentage-point increase from 2014.” The firm said competing directly with these giants is harder than ever. “But by crafting a unique value proposition, retailers can carve out a winning position alongside them and capture significant rewards.” Bain said a clear and compelling value proposition starts “with the fundamentals, be it fast shipping, consistent quality or reliable digital experiences. Miss here, and irrelevance is almost inevitable.” The fundamentals include having balanced assortments that cater to customer preferences, which can boost sales by 2 to 5 percent. “Private brands are becoming an especially powerful tool, adding value through exclusivity,” Bain said noting that the firm’s research shows high-performing private brands can boost grocer share of wallet by 12 percentage points. Pricing and promotions will also be a key to success. “Strong value perception doesn’t always mean chasing the lowest price,” the report stated. “Retailers with a competitive advantage build structured pricing architectures that align with their customer and product strategies, balancing margin growth and market share. Personalized promotions tailored to individual preferences can further enhance value perception and influence buying behavior — ultimately improving ROI.” With the supply chain, Bain recommends diversifying supplier sourcing, which involves retailers adopting “right-shoring strategies” to optimize operations balancing cost, resilience and speed. The firm said the focus is not on shifting entirely to one region, but creating a flexible system capable of addressing priorities such as response times, market proximity, or resource access during volatility. Bain said its research showed that about 70 percent of retailers said they intend to augment onshoring or nearshoring in the next three years, with many U.S. companies lessening dependence on China in favor of regions such as India or North America. For example, Steve Madden plans to cut imports from China by 40 percent to 45 percent next year by establishing alternative production and sourcing in different countries. The footwear brand was one of the first to act in response to an announcement of possible tariffs on China from the administration of President Donald Trump.The report’s authors said optimizing networks with “digital twins” can also mitigate sourcing challenges. Digital twin platforms are virtual models that use real-time data to test the impact of different variables. Retailers are adopting these platforms to simulate disruptive scenarios such as weather or labor shortages, allowing for quick network adjustments and long-term strategic planning. Integrated with real-time tracking for comprehensive visibility, digital twins help pinpoint vulnerabilities, enhance processes and strengthen supply chains.In addition, predictive analytics are increasingly used for smarter inventory management, enabling retailers to anticipate demand shifts and optimize stock levels effectively. “Amid fast-changing consumer preferences and frequent disruptions, precise forecasting is crucial,” the report’s authors said. “AI-powered tools can help analyze demand in real-time, allowing retailers to dynamically adjust inventory placement to reduce transit times, lower costs and prevent costly stockouts or excess inventory. Bain’s experience shows custom AI forecasting models can cut excess inventory by 40 percent and boost accuracy by nearly 50 percent compared to manual planning.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger Stocks were down sharply on Monday on concern about an artificial intelligence stock bubble popping because of the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek that possibly made a competitive AI model for a fraction of the cost. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 122 points, or 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite shed 2.7%, and the S&P 500 slid 1.6%. Last week, DeepSeek released an open source AI model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s in several tests. The company had launched an open source large-language model in December for what it says was less than $6 million. While Wall Street questions that figure, the foreign startup is still raising concern that the billions being spent to build out big AI models could be done for much more cheaply. “Why are investors concerned? The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes recorded their second-straight positive week last week, reassuring investors that the bull market remains intact even after December’s dip. The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days, and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57in the VIX came during last August’s risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai 1 posted on 01/27/2025 7:06:30 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: Red Badger Why was this “news” not reflected in market prices on Friday? 2 posted on 01/27/2025 7:11:18 AM PST by Paladin2 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Red Badger dumb thing about his is that Deepseek has 50k NVDA H100s.

The company had launched an open source large-language model in December for what it says was less than $6 million. While Wall Street questions that figure, the foreign startup is still raising concern that the billions being spent to build out big AI models could be done for much more cheaply. “Why are investors concerned? The news over the past few months has been about the huge capex announcements of Microsoft, which is spending $80bn in ’25, while Meta recently announced investments between $6bn and $65bn,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande. “Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek’s highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” AI darling Nvidia dropped 11%, Broadcom lost 12%, and AMD shed 4%. Microsoft lost 4%. Palantir was also hit for 4%. Other megacap tech names Amazon and Meta Platforms respectively shed 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Derivative plays from the AI buildout like power providers were also hit big. Constellation Energy lost 17%, while Vistra dropped 20%. Monday’s sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with “Magnificent Seven” members Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes recorded their second-straight positive week last week, reassuring investors that the bull market remains intact even after December’s dip. The S&P 500 hit a new intraday record on Friday after notching a fresh all-time closing high in the previous session. 6 Min Ago VIX ‘fear index’ leaps 45% Monday morning as risk-off trades grip stocks The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data.

One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Gary Smith, CEO of the networking company Ciena. You probably aren’t familiar with Ciena — the company isn’t really a household name. But every internet user has relied on the company’s products; in fact, every internet user has used its products. Ciena makes the hardware and software that make the fiber optic cables that connect the world light up with data. That’s everything from local fiber networks for broadband ISPs to the massive undersea cables that connect continents. There’s a high probability that this very podcast came to you over a Ciena-powered network, in fact — this company is everywhere. Gary himself is a fascinating character in this story. He joined Ciena in 1997, the year the company had an astonishingly successful IPO in the middle of the dotcom boom. And he became its CEO in 2001, right after the dotcom crash sent the company’s stock price — and the rest of the economy — into a tailspin. So Gary has had a front-row seat to the development of the internet as we know it, and Ciena has been there every step of the way — as telecoms and undersea cables first brought the planet online, all the way to the rise of cloud computing and, now, generative AI. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! You’re going to hear Gary and I talk a lot about something called WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing, which is the fundamental technical innovation Ciena is built around. WDM is absolutely key to how the modern internet works, and most people have no idea it exists. The basic idea is that WDM uses multiple wavelengths of light to fit more data onto a single fiber optic cable, which allows those cables to deliver more and more information over time — you’ll hear Gary call it “virtualizing” a fiber optic cable, like you’re turning a single cable into two, or five, or 10. This is obviously hugely important as the world’s internet usage increases and data-hungry applications like streaming video and generative AI ramp up. Ciena didn’t invent WDM, but it was the first company to deploy it commercially in the ’90s — and I wanted to know how Gary was managing his investment in pushing that technology forward and whether he was thinking about the next kind of tech that might disrupt it. I also wanted to know about Ciena’s customers. There are only so many companies building deep sea cables and giant data centers, and it won’t surprise you that the customer set has largely shifted from telecom providers and ISPs to giant cloud computing companies like Meta and Google and Microsoft over the past few years. Just a few months ago, Meta announced it would pay $10 billion to build its own exclusive subsea cable stretching nearly 25,000 miles. Ciena sits right in the middle of that complicated relationship between industry and infrastructure, and I think you’ll find Gary’s perspective to be pretty unique. We also got into the fracturing state of the internet and what it means that people in different geographic locations, dependent on various levels of government control, experience the online world differently. Connecting cables stretching across continents means the people on either end of those cables might have very different ideas about the internet, and Ciena has to take all of that into account. See, I’m guessing you didn’t know about Ciena before, but almost every single Decoder idea is right here, sitting on the backbone of the internet. Okay, Ciena CEO Gary Smith. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Gary Smith, you’re the CEO of Ciena. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you. Good to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. The Decoder team and I were talking earlier about how we love stories of hidden companies that run the world, and Ciena very much feels like one of those companies. It is a huge player in networking. It’s a huge player in the future of our networks. There’s some AI to talk about. There’s undersea cables to talk about, which is always fun. Quickly, for everyone, describe what Ciena is and what you do. Basically, Ciena is the leading technology company in the world for providing high-speed connectivity. So if you think about all the networks that have been enabled around the internet and around the world, or, as you alluded to, submarine cables, Ciena is really the driving force behind that high-speed technology. Even with mobile connectivity, terrestrial connectivity, and submarine cable connectivity, we’re basically the best in the world at moving optical bits. I always think about it as two internets, right? There’s the internet we experience — the digital internet — and then there’s the physical internet: the actual cables and wires that connect our networks together and connect us together. That is Ciena’s business, running these cables, figuring out how to move data across them more quickly, and figuring out how to move more data across them. Ciena’s been around for a minute. How has the dynamic between what people are doing on the digital internet most consumers experience and what you need to do on the physical internet changed? It seems like something we don’t ever really get to talk about. I’m very curious to ask you about it. I think we consume most of the internet now in a mobile form, on our iPads, iPhones, or whatever. We still have some desktops, but it’s all laptops. The first point of connectivity there is mobile. It’s available to us all the time. But what we don’t think about is that it’s only mobile until it’s not. It needs to get terrestrialized to the nearest area where it comes down into terrestrial — typically fiber because to get really high speed, you need to use fiber. Wireless has some limitations around that. So basically, until it gets to any mobile application, its real objective is to get terrestrial into that cell tower as quickly as possible. Then, from the bottom of the cell tower is when all the magic starts, with the physical fiber cables and the networks that go around the world. If you have an inquiry, depending on what it is, that could require a different continent. That goes down through the cell tower and out across the sea and back to you. But that’s invisible to us all. We’re able to do it at such high speeds now that it’s transparent to the applications that you’re using. That’s the part I really want to dig into. Intellectually, I think I’ve always understood that. I think most people understand that there are servers and data centers elsewhere and we are communicating with them somehow. But at some point we need to hit a fiber line and actually talk to those servers. What I’m trying to understand is that there’s the consumer application layer of the internet — we’re all going to watch a bunch of Instagram reels or something. Then, there’s the internet we need to build to support that. What’s the relationship between those two? How often do you think, “I see the next set of applications that are coming on phones, I see the next set of devices that people may want to use. or I see the rise of streaming services. We better start building an internet that can support it?” That dynamic often seems subsumed in some cell carrier or data center conversations. It very rarely comes to the forefront. Because it’s the piece that connects all of this stuff. Everybody focuses on things like AI, Netflix, or whatever right now. How do you get those things to manifest themselves to the consumer and to enterprise? The reality is that it required a massive build-out over the last two decades for a fiber infrastructure that basically connects all these data centers together, that connects them through submarine cables, and connects them across countries. It has intelligence on it so it knows where to go to get that information. That has evolved over the last two decades. It continues to evolve because if you think about some of the business models that we now take for granted, like Uber, that wouldn’t be available if you couldn’t get instant response to it. Twenty years ago, that would not have been possible as a business model. There was an interesting point in the early 2000s where there was this massive overbuild of fiber capacity. It was sort of the telecom nuclear winter where we had more capacity than apparently we’d need for the next two decades. People built out all of these large fiber networks and no one came. But that enabled business models to take large amounts of bandwidth at low cost. That created business models like Amazon, which weren’t able to get stimulated and be sustainable until they had large amounts of dependable connectivity. So it’s constantly evolving with applications that are demanding much higher bandwidth. We’re in an era of that now with AI for sure. The networks have to catch up and facilitate that. Let me ask about the networks. Let’s say I want to build a network in some rural part of the country. Do I just call Ciena and say, “All right. We’re going to get to work. Go dig some trenches”? Do I run the network? Do you run the network? How does that work? We don’t run the network. Those are the service provider carriers. If you take North America as an example, there are hundreds of carriers that do the local last mile piece out in the rural areas. Then, there’s the Verizons, Comcasts, and AT&Ts of this world that then facilitate all of that connectivity to the consumer. We provide the technology that powers their networks basically. For them to get that high-speed connectivity, Ciena’s technology goes on the ends of those fiber cables that allows the speed and throughput to continue to drive the capacity. What we basically do is virtualize a single piece of fiber. So instead of having that little thread, which is about a hair thread in terms of weight and distance, we can multiply that many, many times. That’s hundreds of virtual fibers because of the technology we use around it. That’s enabled the whole scaling of the internet. It’s enabled the scaling of this global connectivity phenomenon that we have, and it’s at the center of scaling for AI connectivity now and into the future. That core piece of technology where you’re multiplexing and virtualizing the single piece of fiber, that was Ciena’s big technology bet. I believe it’s called WDM. Explain that to people very quickly. Basically, it’s virtualization. Where you’ve got one piece of fiber, [WDM] makes it look like multiple fibers. Depending on the distance and what you’re putting down, it can be hundreds of fibers, which is actually physically manifested as a single fiber. So you don’t need to put more fibers into the ground. With the technology we have on either end of it, you can just scale it up. So, it’s the virtualization of fiber that has enabled this almost seamless marriage between the applications, to your point, and the driving of all the network traffic with the actual network. Through our technology development, we’ve grown the ability to go do that faster than Moore’s Law. We now have a new piece of technology, called WaveLogic, that can do 1.6 terabits of data down a single piece of fiber. It’s always been explained to me that the fiber is the fiber, and we’re just sending light back and forth. It’s the pieces at the end that actually create the additional bandwidth to create that additional capability. Is that more or less true? Are you just focused on the bits at the end that talk to each other? Absolutely. There are technology developments within the fiber that assist that, for sure, and there’s been a lot of that development from companies like Corning in the fiber world. But basically, the magic is the technology that goes on the end of those fibers. When you think about it, if we had to scale by digging up the place every time we wanted to put more fibers in, it’s just not practical. We can get a tremendous amount of expansion and virtual capacity even on old fibers just by putting our technology on the end of it. You were talking about scaling faster than Moore’s Law, which is roughly a doubling every 18 months. Decoder listeners are very pedantic. They will tell me that’s not actually what Moore’s Law means, but I think that’s how you’re using it. I appreciate our listeners very much, but I don’t think that’s what applies here. You’re talking about a doubling of bandwidth every 18 months. Yes. You’ve been doing WDM since 1997, right? This is the technology bet of the company. Is it the capacity of WDM where you’re using multiple wavelengths of light across a single fiber? Is that what’s doubling? Yeah, it’s our ability to continue to drive that. When we first started, we could multiplex and keep it very simple. It was a single piece of fiber. We thought we could put four virtual fibers down there. That was revolutionary at the time. Many of the carriers we went to with that said, “Oh, that’s fantastic. We’ll never need more than that.” Then, we figured out how to do eight, then 16, then 32, then 64. And we’re way, way beyond that now. So what that means is you have that single piece of fiber that looks like 64 fibers. That’s enabled this massive scaling of architecture around the world. Then, we deploy that technology not just with local connectivity, but across the country and whole continents — 8,000, 10,000-mile submarine cables. We can support that kind of capacity across the submarine cables. Do you just sell these boxes to the telecom and data center providers and walk away? Do you have ongoing support? No, it’s a very integrated partnership. Most of the major carriers — I think 96 percent of the major carriers around the world — are Ciena customers. These are collaborations that we’ve worked on for multiple decades. We help manage the networks. We do a lot of the installation work for them. We do the planning. We have the software that actually manages the network and looks for predictive issues or challenges and switches automatically. If there are problems on certain fibers, it will detect that and switch it through. So, there’s a lot of underlying technology and collaboration between us and all the service providers. Also all of the hyperscalers. Pretty much all of the hyperscalers use Ciena to connect their data centers around the world. We partner with them as well on technology developments that are specific to their networks. You look at the hyperscalers, some of the largest networks in the world, and they’re very complicated, multi-continent, metro, long-haul, submarine cables. The biggest players and the biggest owners of capacity on submarine cables now are actually the cloud players. That used to be the traditional service providers, but now it’s the likes of Google and Meta that really own a lot of the global capacity on those submarine cables. This is the thing that I was talking about at the beginning. It seems so hard to understand, and it’s so interesting to talk to you about it because you’re in it. The internet we experience is obviously changing the dynamics of the internet we build. So. I experience my phone and there’s a bunch of stuff happening on some data center owned by Google, Microsoft, or whatever, and that means those companies now own most of the capacity of undersea cables. I don’t think that chain of events is intuitive unless you’re paying attention to it. But just talking to you for 13 minutes here, that seems very intuitive to you. It makes sense to you that they would have the capacity because I’m not sending nearly as much data as a consumer across the ocean. Do you see that changing? How fast has that grown? Describe that dynamic to me. Take the submarine cables as an example. It’s a good proxy for what’s happened here. From the 1980s to 2010, this was all funded by the service providers. It was a way of getting transatlantic phone conversations largely to Europe and a little bit to Asia. These companies, like British Telecom and AT&T, would have these cables, they would get together a consortium, and, as a syndicate, fund these submarine cables. With the advent of cloud, you had these players that wanted to have very high-speed connectivity. Take for example Meta, Google, Microsoft, or any of these players. If they were going to be in the European market, they needed to have very high speed, dedicated capacity. So in about 2010, you began to see the cloud players purchasing the capacity of those submarine cables. In the last five years or so, you’ve seen Google begin to own many of these cables, with Meta and others too. So, it evolved from, “Hey, it’s all this service provider and it’s just phone calls.” When you want to reach your aunt in Europe, in India, or whatever, then it’s just a phone call, which is a very small amount of data. The amount of data that’s now being required by these cloud players is multiple more times than that. You’ve got a lot of graphics going over it as well, which takes a lot of bandwidth. So the need for bandwidth has grown dramatically. It makes sense that the cloud players want to connect their data centers. If they’re putting a data center in India and want to connect it to North America, they want to own the connectivity for that, and it’s a much higher speed. So they’re not just buying the capacity. They’re actually taking control and owning the cables. So, there’s been sort of an evolution of that over the last five years. The first 10 years was, “Hey, we will take the capacity now.” Their networks are made up of a hybrid of owning the cable, owning some, or they rent it from the service providers. But you’ve now got, I think, 600-plus submarine cables around the world. You’ve got about 1.5 million kilometers of fiber at the bottom of the sea facilitating this, and the cloud players are really driving that marketplace now. That’s going to lead us into the inevitable conversation we’ll have about AI, but I just want to stay on this for one second. How has the verticalization, from “what we sell is virtualized compute capacity” down to “we will now own the cables in the ocean and verticalize our business and make sure we own it tip to tail,” changed your company? We’re looking at, “There’s WDM in 1997. This is the core innovation that lets us get more capacity out of the fiber networks. We’re initially going to sell that to telecom companies to do more phone calls or the early internet.” Now, multiple generations in, you’re selling it directly to Google to connect data centers so that it might run AI workloads.” It feels like that would have some pressure on your roadmaps and your go-to-market. How is that expressed? The evolution has been such that the first appreciators for that technology were obviously the service providers. As the internet began to gain traction in 2003, 2004, you began to see the cloud players get more interested in the network because if they’re going to monetize and get to the eyeballs that they wanted, the network actually becomes important to them. So, there’s been a steady increase in appreciation of that even prior to the AI piece, and they’ve become much more active. I mean, we really didn’t sell to the cloud players until about 10 years ago, and we had zero market share there. Now, we’ve got the main market share with a leading player in connecting data centers and cloud players around the world. Submarine cables are the same kind of thing. We really didn’t focus on the submarine cables with our technology because there wasn’t that much capacity being required. We’ve now got number one share in submarine cable connectivity around the world because they value very high-speed capacity. So the cloud players have gone from being a very small percentage of our business to over 50 percent of our business now being, directly or indirectly, cloud and hyperscalers. So it’s a very significant shift in the business, and that’s really accelerated in the last five years. I think this is a great time to ask the classic Decoder questions. You’re describing a shift in the business and a shift in your customers. How is Ciena organized now? What does that org chart look like? It’s been easier for us in some ways because we’ve always been the leading technology company, so it’s really about who appreciates that technology and collaborates. This shift to the submarine markets and to cloud players has generally been a good fit for Ciena because we move very quickly, and we’re at cutting-edge technology. The latest technology we have is actually on three-nanometer chips. We were the first company in the world to have a 3nm chip actually be used in the telecom space, and we’re now actually working on our second. We’ve got that out, it’s carrying traffic around the world, and we’re working on our second version of that. We’ve always been at the leading edge of technology, and it really is a natural fit with these cloud players. So, we’re organized very simply. We have a large-service provider team around the world, a dedicated team for the hyperscalers and cloud, and an engineering team that works with them on co-development and stuff with that kind of technology. I’m a great believer in simplicity of organizational design. So, we have a very simple organizational structure that’s evolved to address that. That’s how we’re able to scale as quickly as we have. You’ve got the two big markets — the telecoms and the hyperscalers — and you have the engineering organization. I’m assuming the telecoms and the cloud providers want different things. How is that expressed in what the engineering organization goes off and builds? It’s interesting. There’s a lot of commonality about what they want. If you think about it from an engineering point of view and the latest WaveLogic technology we just developed, we actually take that same technology and we deploy it in slightly different variants to both markets. So, we get a better scale of development over that. Obviously, we develop a single chip and then do variants of it for specific applications that they want, but that same technology is essentially consumed across the service provider world because they all want the same thing: better economics across the fiber that they’ve got and increased bandwidth. The particular sensitivity, I would say — what’s really the difference between the two markets — is the cloud players are much more focused on power, which we all hear about from a data center point of view. It manifests itself exactly the same way in the telecom networks. We do variants that are power optimized for the cloud players, but that’s the predominant difference. That’s just taking the same core technology and doing a different variant of it that’s prioritized around power. That enables us to scale the development and the rest of it. So, we have a single global engineering team focused on this core technology. Ciena has always been a very focused player. We’ve been very focused on just high-speed connectivity. This has enabled us when most of our competitors are trying to do mobile or other kinds of things. For the past three decades, we just wanted to be the best in the world at moving optical bits at a high speed. The opportunity we have now is increasingly into the campus and potentially even inside the data center with that same core technology, and that’s all in front of us. We get zero revenue from there right now. But it’s the same customers, so that’s an exciting opportunity for us in the future. I want to talk about that a little bit more, but can I just ask one more question? You said power. That suggests to me that you’re building a data center, you have an energy budget, and then you hold all the vendors to some number on the line to make sure you hit your energy budget. You’re feeling that too, even as the person is like, “Here’s the box that connects to the fiber line.” Yes. It manifests itself differently obviously, but everybody talks about the data centers and the power and the rest of it. Everybody is very focused on that for obvious reasons. But that same issue deploys when they come out onto the network too. You put amplifiers on the fiber to do that, and around these amplification sites, they want super low power because they are constrained around power and space. I’m assuming they would rather spend their power budget on running the GPUs as hot as they can. Exactly. They don’t want to spend it on the communications part, or they want to spend as little as possible on that. They want it optimized. We’re able to do that for them in terms of the footprint of the technology. We can now get down on a single plug what used to be a rack of cords. Quite literally, a six-foot-wide rack on a single plug, that same capacity. That’s what we’ve evolved over the last two decades with. So, we’re well placed with these guys to continue to drive down the power usage on the network, not just in the data center. How big is Ciena? How many people are on all of these various teams? We’re close to about 10,000 people worldwide. We’re very distributed. This year’s consensus revenue is about $4.4 billion, something like that. We’re profitable, and we have a strong balance sheet. We very much invest directly into this technology. Because we’ve been such a focused player at it, we felt that this high-speed connectivity would be appreciated eventually, and it’s really coming into its own now. You have to make these investments for the long term. Some of our technologies take five-plus years to evolve. We’re fortunate in this time right now. It’s a good intersection point where high-speed technology is super appreciated. Is that an even split? Is it 3,300 in engineering, 3,300 in hyperscaler sales- No, it’s basically predominantly engineering. As you can imagine, this kind of technology is more about engineering, so more than half of our team are engineering talent. We’ve got applications engineers at the front end who help make sure we understand the applications and work with the customers on that, but more than half is engineering. As I said to you earlier on, it’s a very simple structure. One of the things that really strikes me is there is this core enabling invention, WDM. The company is built around it. Ciena’s made a few acquisitions over the years. You’ve led a few of them. There was one in 2019 for Centina Systems. Is WDM still the heart of it? Is that proprietary Ciena we’re building around it? Is there a next way to use fiber that’s coming? No, it’s basically the journey that we’re on. We’ve made multiple acquisitions, but it’s all been about the core mission, which is high-speed connectivity and the things we need around that. A lot of the acquisitions have been around vertical integration of that, so we have more control over it. It’s not just the core technology. It’s the things around it that you need to do. Most of those surrounding technologies were where we could focus and provide competitive advantage by doing something to them. Over the years, we’ve worked very carefully at acquisitions and organic developments that make us vertically integrated so we can control that. There’s advantages to control and scale, but what really drove us was that we think we can put competitive advantages in each of the technologies that we gather around the core technology, if that makes sense. The reason I’m asking that is because often you might want to buy a company that’s early to the next turn, but it seems like WDM is still the heart of what you’re doing, and you don’t see a finish line there. Basically, it’s this technology. The actual variant that we focus on is the coherent technology, and that’s what has enabled this DWDM to scale so much. But there are other technologies around it that we’ve developed, like the SerDes — the Serializer / Deserializer — and the kinds of things that are for analog conversion, which is incredibly difficult to do. We’ve got some of the best technology in the world around that. It’s the moat that you put around that, but it’s not the next thing. We think there’s a lot of headroom, particularly because this technology is all deployed right now. Think about it outside the data center. So as soon as it wants to present outside the data center, that’s Ciena. The opportunities we have with the same kinds of technology are now becoming apparent inside the campus — these campuses are getting super big now — and eventually will be inside the data center. That’s because the GPU and compute investment that’s going on requires higher and higher speed over longer and longer distances, even in some of these data centers. First of all, they’re enormous. You’ve got fiber going around them, sometimes multiple kilometers within a single data center with that fiber getting wrapped around. We think there’s an intersection point for our technology there. The technology there right now, which is just called direct-connect, is required to connect all of the racks within the data center and the intra-data center. The physics of that is getting challenged as these GPUs require higher and higher speed. So, we think there’s a real opportunity for us to intersect that, to your point, with the same kind of core technology that requires some variations over the next 1–3 years. Let me ask you the classic Decoder question, and then I want to get into that. You’ve been at Ciena for a long time. I think you’ve been there for 30 years. You’ve been the CEO for almost 25 now. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? Depends on what kind of decision it is, right? Not all decisions are equal. I very much feel that it’s a team game. When we make strategic decisions — which I think is what you’re alluding to with how we invest and what long-term things we’re focused on — we’re strategically aligned around what we want to go do. We’re a very focused company. Back to the point I was making earlier, I think people appreciate the best of breed, and we want to be the best in the world at what we do. The north star is very clear to us. Then, it’s about what things we need to do to get out into the future on that. From that point of view, the decision making is somewhat easier because we know we’ve chopped the field, so we know where we’re playing on. There’s not some great conversation about adjacencies and things that we might want to get into; it’s all based on our core technology. To answer your question, if it’s something strategic around those investments, it’s always a team game. We’re super collaborative. It’s how we work and get cross-functional input into all of those things. So, it’s a process. But I would say that I think the role of a CEO sometimes is to say, “Okay. We’ve had the debate. This is the overall perspective of what we want to do. Let’s go.” I think part of the role of the CEO is to facilitate the best conversations and discussions and then help drive to a conclusion. Let me give you a hypothetical that I suspect you will shrug off, but I’m going to try anyway. You’re looking at two big groups of clients. You’ve got your telecom companies, and you’ve got your big cloud providers who are all racing into AI. You have some opportunity to grow that business by going into the data centers, not just landing the fiber at the doorstep. That seems like the much richer opportunity. I look at the state of the telecoms in the United States, for example. They’re not growing much, right? They’re churning customers between them. It would seem very obvious that your entire team would say, “Don’t worry about them so much. We need to put all of our focus on the AI providers because that is where there’s growth using our same core technology.” But then you still have to service the telecom customers, I imagine. How do you balance that out? How do you make that decision to say, “These investments are going to go over here?” It’s actually much easier for us because, back to the point I was making, it’s the same kind of core technology. When we move the ball down the field for the cloud players, we can apply that to the service provider space because it’s the same core technology. In terms of their needs, there are actually a lot of similarities. Another way of thinking about this is when we start talking about the data center and the rest of it, we provide optical systems where we do the whole thing for the service providers. And we do that pretty much for the cloud players too. So we do all of the systems for the software, what we call the WDM modem technology, and the line systems. We do all of that, and often we’ll install it, support it, and maintain it. We do that for service providers and we do that for the cloud players. Then, to the point around the opportunity in the data center, it’s not necessarily about providing those complete systems. It’s taking them, putting them in plugs, and then putting them in components. So it’s a different kind of play, but it’s still the core technology. So, anything you do to advance that also applies to our systems business, and our systems business is both service provider and in the cloud. You don’t have to make the “which are your favorite children?” kind of choice, which is where you were going with that. I think that’s another benefit of a company staying super focused on its core technology and understanding what value we bring to the world. That is very difficult for anybody else to replicate, Well, can I ask you about that? Because it feels like the Trump administration is incoming. By the time people listen to this, he will have been inaugurated and we’ll be off to the races with a new kind of business climate here in the United States. Mergers will be in fashion again. They have not been in fashion over the past four years. If I was running Google or Microsoft, I would say, “Well, this is the core technology that’s going to make my data center more efficient and move data faster on my cable. I’m just going to buy this company.” Have you been approached to be acquired? Well, I’m not going to– I’m just wondering because I can see why over the past several years, all of that conversation has chilled. But it’s also remarkable to me that a company like Ciena has remained independent for 30 years. That used to be the conversation all the time. Think about 20 years ago. I’m not sure some of your viewers will remember some of these names: Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel, even Nokia. The model was all what I call the “generalist model.” They were actually spin outs from their phone companies like Marconi. Northern Telecom came out of Canada. So with the model, we had to be end to end. You had to put switches, routers, handsets, mobile infrastructure, and this thing called transport. We said when we started, “No, we’re going to just focus on the transport piece because we think it can get to scale.” What’s happened over the last two decades is that the generalists, because they couldn’t afford to be at the cutting edge in each of those areas, have all struggled. You trace the genesis of all of those companies now and basically they’re all in Nokia. With Alcatel and Lucent and all the rest of them, the music stopped and that’s where they ended up. The point I’m making about that is the world’s too competitive now for the whole end-to-end thing and being a generalist supplier. It just absolutely is. They used to say to us, “Well, when are you going to get bought?” We used to say, “Listen, we’re a public company. We have all the fiduciary responsibilities that you would expect with a public company, but we think we can get to scale and be a real company just doing what we’re doing.” Now, these things take a while and we’ve been public for 25 years, but we’re at a point now where we absolutely have scale. We’re very strong financially. We can invest in this kind of technology. We’ve got the number one market share in all the key markets that we want to play in. So, we’ve got a good opportunity to drive shareholder value from here. Do you think that DWDM, the multiplexing you do to virtualize the fiber, is enough of a moat? You were describing the other acquisitions you’ve made and how you surround the core technology with other things to enter different markets as the moat. But is that core technology something that… I don’t know if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and was like, “screw it, I’m open sourcing it,” he could just do it? Or is that more specialized? There are other companies that have variants of this technology, for sure. It’s just that we’re able to implement it faster and quicker and better than anybody else, and we have the core competencies around it. A bit of an analogy is TSMC. People kind of know how to do [what TSMC does], but they can’t do it, right? You can go to ASML and ask for a machine and that’s not where it stops. Yeah. Because it’s people, and it’s the folks that understand that it’s the five, 10 percent of each of these areas that really make the difference to things when you put it and all the things we’ve built around it all together. So like with any of these things, it’s a confluence that makes up the competitive advantage. It’s when you get down to the real technologies. It’s all of those things that provide the moat for us. It’s the fact that we’re focused and the fact that we’re now so embedded with these key cloud and technology companies and were part of the collaboration process around the evolution of their networks. It’s the relationships that you build up, that trusted relationship and the technology collaboration over time. That’s why we think we’ve got an opportunity to take that into a whole new market for us with the campus and eventually inside the data center. I want to talk about two things that seem like they’re going to happen to the hyperscalers, in particular, over the next four, 10 years. One of them has a lot to do with subsea cables and the other one is obviously AI. Let’s start with subsea cables. If I look broadly at our nation’s big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple — they’re about to enter into a world where an emboldened Donald Trump wants to just reset the international order. They own cables that connect our continents together. There’s a lot of people who want to break the internet apart in different ways. We might ban TikTok. We might not ban TikTok. China doesn’t allow our apps there. There’s a lot of interest in what is happening on our networks that connect our countries together and who gets what where. Then there’s just the reality that they are wires in the ground. Bad things happen to them. They get cut. There are wars. How much of that do you engage with personally? How much do you think about, “Okay. There are some fraught geopolitics that are about to change. I need to make some decisions to get ahead of it, be aware of it, insulate myself against it, or insulate Ciena against it?” How much of your time do you spend on that? I mean, there are the headings of things you can control and then things that you can’t control but need to be mindful of, right? It’s definitely in that second list. I could argue that over the last five or 10 years we’ve had quite a lot of geopolitical dynamics going on. We are mindful of that, particularly because we operate in multiple countries, so 80 countries around the world. Our technology is widely deployed. We are mindful of those kinds of dynamics, and I’ll give you an example. We made a decision in the early 2000s that we would not go in and be a provider to the Chinese market for its major service providers. There was a whole set of thought processes that went into that. One of our competitors at the time was Huawei and it was just emerging. I don’t think people appreciate this, but the first real iteration of technology that Huawei came out with was actually in our space, so way before all the mobile stuff and all the other omnipotent things that it’s now doing. So around 2003 we said, “What’s this company, what are they doing, and how is it achieving price points that are just lower than our cost?” Turns out that we’re being subsidized by the Chinese government, right? It’s like we’ve seen this movie several times since 2003. So one of the thought processes that we had, just to give you an illustration , we said, “You know what? We will not compete with it directly in the China market. It obviously wants us there because we’ve got leading technology and the rest of it. We’re actually not going to manufacture in China either. So we’re going to be the antithesis, if you like, of Huawei in every single way. We’re going to be the alternative that’s not a Chinese manufacturer, and we won’t operate there.” That was a very controversial thing. You imagine a young company that’s just gone public and going, “Hang on a minute, why are you not going into the largest market and fastest growing telecom market in the world?” But we had the strength of our convictions. It’s taken a while, but I think largely that was a good decision for us because we didn’t get distracted by that Chinese market. They’ll give you 10 percent of that market, but they’ll make sure you won’t get anything else, and you’ll partner with a local partner. I spent a lot of time in Asia. I lived in Asia for a number of years before I came to Ciena. And I saw that movie, to your point, play out in so many different ways. I was super sensitive to that, as was the team. So, that is an instance of us doing something because of the geopolitical dynamics at the time and us making a decision. You don’t know how that’s going to play out because things can change., You’ve just got to be smart around what you think is the best thing for the shareholders and your company and stick to it. Do you mostly follow the lead of the clients? Do you have your own points of view on geopolitics? I’m thinking of things like when you land the cable in Europe and your devices there decoding all the traffic that there are a number of European spy agencies that might want to sit right next to that. The NSA in our country would love to sit right next to that. When you land in other countries that have different kinds of privacy and security concerns, they might want to be a part of that. Is that something where you say, “Look, Meta owns this cable. You talk to Meta. We’re going to do what the client says,” or is that, “We are simply not going to build these cables in certain devices”? We’re actually pretty fortunate that we don’t have to make some of those tough decisions because it’s not our cable. So to your point — But the data going over the cable, that’s you, right? You’re encoding and decoding it? Yeah, that’s what we’re doing, but even that technology is owned by the customer. We sold that to the customer, and what they do with it is entirely up to them. We don’t have control over that. It’s their network.. It’s their property. You think about these submarine cables. Someone owns the cable, and we put the technology on the end of it. It’s their technology. They own that, and they run it as well. We don’t run it. So they run those networks. We’re fortunate in that we’ve always been able to stay one step behind some of those dilemma questions. It’s not something we have to opine on. When you think about the actual cables, they’re in international waters. What’s the longest one that you operate? I think it’s about 10,000 kilometers. Some of these cables are around the Pacific where you get the big distances, so they are very, very long cables. A lot of them stop off on different islands and places and spur off. Some of the new cables going in are spurring off in different places. We’ve also developed a technology that overlays that provides for resilience. So if you get a cut on a particular cable, then we can reroute it depending on the architecture. It’s called GeoMesh. It’s software and technology that’s embedded into our core offerings and enables us to provide resilience across some of those submarine cable links. In the normal run of things, you get I think something like 100-plus faults a year, mainly trawlers dragging their anchors on a fiber cable because they’re buried at the bottom of the sea until they’re not. I mean, they’ve got to come up somewhere. Typically, it’s in the shallower waters where you’ll get some fishing vessel come across it. Do you ever get angry sharks? Do you ever get a text message like “shark attack brought down the network?” Actually, that’s a common question I get asked around it. There is a section around fish attacks. I think it’s zero. I’m sure there are some examples of it that someone can point to over the last three decades, but I’ve never heard of it personally. I think they’ve got other things to worry about than these little tiny... it’s about the size of a big hosepipe, so I don’t think it’d be particularly interesting to them. We have this phrase that we’ve been using at The Verge, my friend Casey Newton came up with it ages ago. He calls it the “Splinternet,” where we perceive one cohesive internet, but really we’re fracturing. We’re fracturing into continent-specific, country-specific internets. As I talked to you about the cloud providers, it’s very obvious to me that we now have a number of private internets operating at high speed around the world that are just owned and controlled by single companies. You have a long view of the internet. You are one of the few guests on Decoder who’s ever just straight up talked about Alcatel. You have a long view of the internet, how we’ve grown it, and what it’s for. The telecoms, by and large, were national champions, right? That’s how they have thought about themselves. Even in the United States, that’s how they’ve thought about themselves. That’s where they came from. There’s a new kind of nationalism in America around our tech giants in the Trump administration. Mark Zuckerberg says, “I want the Trump administration to go fight the European regulators on my behalf.” That’s new, it hasn’t come up before. We’ll see if this jacket fits. He’s trying it on. But the way we build networks is an expression of national capability. We haven’t experienced that too much as the internet. It’s been one global internet that connects all, and then we do whatever we want and set our borders. But we haven’t actually split the networks apart. But now you’ve got big cloud provider private networks. You do have rising nationalism around the world. You just have a pulling apart of the internet. Is that affecting how you are building networks or how your clients are asking you to build networks? I totally understand the notion, and I think what you’ve got is that a disproportionate amount — this is sort of an English understatement — of the innovation and development for all of this has been done in the US, amongst all these technology companies, for sure. Now, the big cloud players are investing in that network because that’s their business model, and the network is becoming more and more important. When we talk about the network, to your point, we talk about it in this homogeneous form. But if you think about this in the context of some of the large markets that the US cloud players are trying to get into… take places like India. When they enter the Indian market, they are dependent upon connectivity from the local carriers. So they can tip up with the submarine cables and the landing stations, but then it’s, “How do I get connected to all the people I need to get connected to in India enterprise and consumer?” They are then dependent on the local carriers, be it Bharti, Jio, Vodafone Idea, some of the wholesale carriers that are also there, and fiber. There’s always going to be an interrelationship because as omnipotent as all of these cloud players are, they’re not going to be able to connect to everybody’s home across the planet. So you’ve always got this interplay between service providers and the cloud players. What often happens there is that in some of these countries, the service provider will provide a specific network for the cloud player, and they call it a Managed Optical Fiber Network, or MOFN. And we help facilitate that. It’s our technology, so it matches all of their global networks. But it’s owned and operated by the local service provider to support Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Increasingly, I’d argue you’re seeing that interdependency work. So, I wouldn’t say it’s the counter-argument to the idea that we’re all splitting up because at the end of the day, to get to the consumers around the world, these service providers are not going away in that regard. That’s not going to change. They are the only ones that can provide that connectivity ultimately, be it the enterprise or the consumer. I’m fascinated by this because it does seem like the overall geopolitical dynamics of the world are changing, and the internet will change with it. I just keep coming back to the question I started with, which is about how the experience we have on the digital internet obviously impacts the physical internet that you are responsible for building. I’m always trying to find the touchpoints between the two. The way we architect networks in India has a direct relationship to the Indian internet that those users experience, and it seems like those things are, if not diverging completely between different countries, certainly beginning down different paths. That, to me, seems utterly fascinating. I want to end with AI here. As you think about entering their data centers and saying, “We can envision some new high bandwidth, high capacity workloads in these data centers,” which for the past 15 years we have not really come up with massive new ones outside of streaming video. Streaming video is a lot, but that’s basically what we came up with. Now there’s some new ones in AI that might hit all kinds of new industries. Do you think that that is just an exponential rise in how much capacity we need, how much power we’ll need to use, how much networking capacity that we’ll sustain? Or is it, to make the comparison earlier to dark fiber, building out a lot of capacity that we’ll eventually use over time? That’s a great question. Having lived through the previous period of the telecom nuclear winter where we built out all this capacity — and as it turned out, no one came — it did facilitate all these business models that wouldn’t have accelerated without that glut of capacity. I get asked the question if we’re in another bubble around all of these data centers. Specifically around the data center piece, I think there’s an insatiable demand for compute, to build out compute power. These things always take longer than we all think to monetize and the rest of it, so we’re probably going to go through some iterations. But to answer your real question, I’m actually of the opposite view this time round. I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic and bandwidth that will be required to go do this because we’re already seeing a clip up in cloud traffic. We’re pretty well placed to see that. Now, how much of that could I attribute to AI? Some of it is, but I’ve got no way of really discerning which bit is which, and it’s not our network. But there’s a definite uptick in cloud traffic just to connect to all of these data centers. We are absolutely seeing that, and I think that’s going to continue because you’ve got a lot more data centers coming online in the next 18 months, or two years around the world. If they’re going to monetize any of that, they’ve got to all be connected for learning, training, and the rest of it. That’s before you even see the applications for medical use or verticalization, whatever you want to call it. Using your ChatGPTs is generating traffic, sure. But then you start to get to any of that medical usage, for example, and the amount of graphics that are required. Graphics are about 10–20 times more bandwidth-consuming than normal data. So, if you start to get to the monetization of that through these vertical applications, I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic that’s going to be there. When you plan out growth for the company — obviously, you’re a public company, so you have to do it out in front of everyone and talk about risk — in your most optimistic view, is it sustainable, the rate of demand that you see now? You’re saying we’re underestimating it. I look at it maybe a bit more cynically, which is, “Wow, we are building a lot of capacity against business models that don’t exist.” OpenAI has yet to turn $1 in profit, and it wants all of the power that the world can generate. It wants every GPU that Nvidia can build. That’s a lot, right? There’s an inherent promise there that this will all pay off. Maybe you would call that a bubble or maybe you won’t. I’m just looking at it more mathematically. A lot of companies are going to sell a lot of things to these data centers. We’re going to build a lot of capacity, and maybe at some point we will have built enough or not enough or something will happen, but that will come to an end. Then a company like yours is saying, “Well, we’ve had this rate of growth and now maybe it’s plateaued or maybe it’s going down.” How are you thinking about that? I think about it like this: Don’t confuse compute capacity with the network. The network is always the afterthought to all of this, right? It’s, “Oh my gosh, I do actually need to connect these data centers.” So what’s the hierarchy of their thought process? It’s, “I need the compute. I need the power. I need the space.” Those are the things that are driving their decision. Then by the way, “Oh my gosh, I need to connect these data centers right now.” I’m being flippant, but it is down there. I’d like to tell you it was right up there, but it isn’t. In the answer to this question, I think that’s actually a good thing. We only get there when they need it. They’re not building out these enormous capacities because we see it. We’re putting capacity out there, and they’re putting traffic down it. So I take real comfort from that, having lived through 2002 and 2003 when our revenues went down from something like $1.6 billion to about $300 million in one year. I’ve still got the scars from that, so I’m particularly sensitive to this. This is not the same dynamic. They are actually putting capacity out, and as fast as we put it out there, traffic is coming through it. To your point and to what a lot of other folks are saying, is it going to get overheated in terms of the GPU stuff and the data centers and the rest of it? In my personal opinion? Absolutely. Will there be a bit of a tail off in all of that? Absolutely. Will it take longer for applications in the AI world to truly generate the economics? Absolutely. But we’re not banking on that. We’re just seeing this nice steady growth in bandwidth, which I think will pervade throughout. Here’s another way of answering your question. Over the last two decades, bandwidth has grown about 20, 30 percent a year and is not cyclical. When you think about it, it shouldn’t be cyclical, should it? We’re just putting more and more applications out, we’re using our phones for more stuff, more people are getting phones, and all these devices are now connected. That has been very steady and consistent throughout. Even when you get an economic downturn, it continues at about that pace. What we’re talking about here is the advent of AI on top of that. Exactly what is it going to be? No one really knows. There’s all these models, but no one really knows. But it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to come on top of that and could push us to 30, 40 percent bandwidth growth per year, and I think that’s going to be pretty sustainable. When you think about all the promise of AI, the real trick to it is you start putting any graphics down it. Every time you hear [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai say multi-modal AI, I can see the dollar signs floating through the offices over there. I love it. We’re basically planning our business on what we see, and we’ve taken our growth rates up. Typically, this business has grown. We’ve grown about 7 or 8 percent. We’re now saying it’s going to grow 8 to 11 percent over the next three years, and that’s without any massive entry into the data center space or anything else. It’s just what we see from a cloud growth point of view. You’ve talked a lot about entering the data center using the same core technology that you use for the undersea cables and the telecom providers. What are the barriers to doing that and what were the things you assessed when you thought, “Okay. This is the market we have to address”? The barriers to entry there are that you’ve got a technology called direct-connect, which has been well ensconced there really since the start of communication in data centers. You’ve got an ecosystem there that is going to be designed to elongate that for as long as possible, and the customers want to keep it for as long as possible. With the analytics we’ve done on it and working with them, they think that there’s going to be an intersection point where the physics of that gets to the point where it’s not sustainable. We think we’ve got to the point with power and space where there’s a good intersection. So it’s the analytics around that and working with two or three of these players who are already our customers but outside the data center. Is that them coming to you or are you going to them? A little bit of both. We have strong relationships with them, so that collaboration has been there. We’re realistic about it. The existing way of working and that direct-connect? That’s not going away. That’s probably still the majority of applications for it. So you’re looking at what the subset of corner-case applications are for this kind of high-speed connectivity. But even a small part of that is massive for us and massive from a scale point of view given the amount of spend that’s gone on in that space. It’s always about taking risks when that market isn’t there right now, but if you wait until that market appears, it’s too late. If you’re waiting for, “Oh, what’s the market share of this and what’s the growth rate?” At the end of the day, you’ve just got to go with what your intuition is and what you’re hearing and seeing from the customers and the rest. So we’ve got our first iteration of technology for this coming out at the end of the year. That’s a bet that we placed two, three years ago. As you know, the timing takes a while with some of these chip designs and stuff. You have to guess where the market’s going to go, not where it is right now. There’s always an element of risk to it. Listen, having gone through some of this before, you’re never going to get it completely right. You just have to be in the right vector, pay attention, and tweak along the way around it. So we’re listening intently. Gary, this was an incredible conversation. You’re going to have to come back sometime. I could talk to you about this for hours and hours. Love to. I enjoyed it, Nilay. Good questions. Good stuff. We’ll see. We should have you back a couple of years from now and see how stressed you are about these undersea cables. I think that would be very interesting. We’re certainly in for some entertainment, aren’t we? I know what we’re writing about for the next four years. Gary, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added.

Nvidia, the chip designer who has been a major beneficiary of the AI hype, slid around 11%. With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

With that, the megacap tech stock was on track to notch its worst day since March 2020. Other AI trades like Micron and Arm Holdings dropped more than 8% and 9%, respectively. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices lost more than 14% and 5%, respectively. Constellation Energy and Vistra , two of the best-known derivative plays tied to the power buildout for AI, plummeted about more than 12% and 19%, respectively. International markets also felt the impacts. Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Netherlands-based chip companies ASML and ASM International both pulled back sharply in European trading. In Asia, Japanese chip-related stocks including Advantest and Tokyo Electron were broadly lower. DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model in late December, claiming it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million — a much smaller expense than the one called for by Western counterparts. Last week, the company released a reasoning model that also reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s latest in many third-party tests. In a social media post, Marc Andreesen called DeepSeek’s product “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” and a “profound gift to the world.” The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder recently gained notoriety for his support of President Donald Trump. These developments have stoked concerns about the amount of money big tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers, and raised alarm that the U.S. is not leading the sector as much as previously believed. “DeepSeek clearly doesn’t have access to as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers and somehow managed to develop a model that appears highly competitive,” said Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James, in a Monday note. Pajjuri said DeepSeek could “drive even more urgency among U.S. hyperscalers,” a group of large computing infrastructure players like Amazon and Microsoft . Specifically, the analyst said these companies can leverage their advantage from access to graphics processing units to set themselves apart from cheaper options. GPUs are a key part of the infrastructure required to train huge AI models. Nvidia is the market leader in GPUs. The cost of computing has become a key topic of conversation following the DeepSeek news, according to Citi analysts. While the dominance of U.S. companies on the most advanced AI models may be threatened, they said, a key barrier for competitors is access to the best chips. Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Because of this, leading AI companies likely won’t move away from the more-advanced GPUs, the analysts said. Last week’s announcement of the $500 billion Stargate AI project is a “nod to the need for advanced chips,” they added. To be sure, Bernstein analysts expressed doubt over whether the DeepSeek tool was actually built for less than $6 million. They questioned if that figure left out other costs from prior research and experiments to get the technology to where it is today. Despite stressing that DeepSeek’s models “look fantastic,” the team said they shouldn’t be thought of as “miracles.” And panic about the “death-knell of the AI infrastructure complex as we know it,” the Bernstein analysts said, was “overblown.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; History; Military/Veterans KEYWORDS: ai; ccp; china; deepseek; nvda; nvidia; openai; stargateai Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-37 next last 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:50:46 AM PST by Red Badger [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: ShadowAce; dayglored; Swordmaker PING!..................... 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:51:09 AM PST by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Title: Has DeepSeek Ended The AI Run Led By NVIDIA? A Deep Dive Into What’s Next For The Magnificent Seven
URL: https://wccftech.com/has-deepseek-ended-the-ai-run-led-by-nvidia/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:45:42Z
Full Content:
Well, it's not a great day for AI investors, and NVIDIA in particular, since the Chinese firm DeepSeek has managed to disrupt industry norms with its newest R1 AI model, which is said to change the concept of model training and the resources involved behind it. If you have been living under the rocks or still haven't understood why the "AI markets" are panicking right now, this post is definitely for you. So, China has managed to launch an AI model that is said to be trained using significantly lower financial resources, which we'll talk about later, and this has stirred the debate on the fact whether the "AI supercycle" witnessed in the past year is overhyped or rather not worth the money poured into it. DeepSeek R1 has managed to compete with some of the top-end LLMs out there, with an "alleged" training cost that might seem shocking. Let's start with what DeepSeek R1 is, and how it differs from the others. The R1 is a one-of-a-kind open-source LLM model that is said to primarily rely on an implementation that hasn't been done by any other alternative out there. While we won't go much into technicals since that would make the post boring, but the important point to note here is that the R1 relies on a "Chain of Thought" process, which means that when a prompt is given to the AI model, it demonstrates the steps and conclusions it has made to reach to the final answer, that way, users can diagnose the part where the LLM had made a mistake in the first place. Another interesting fact about DeepSeek R1 is the use of "Reinforcement Learning" to achieve an outcome. It is a type of machine learning where the model interacts with the environment to make its decision through a "reward-based process." When a desirable outcome is reached, the model makes sure to opt for those where the reward is maximum, and in this way, it is certain that the desirable conclusion will be achieved. Whereas, with GPT's o1, the core focus is on supervised learning methods, which involve training the model on massive datasets of text and code, which ultimately requires more financial resources. Speaking of financial resources, there's a lot of misconception in the markets around DeepSeek's training costs, since the rumored "$5.6 million" figure is just the cost of running the final model, not the total cost. Since China is restricted from accessing cutting-edge AI computing hardware, it won't be wise of DeepSeek to reveal its AI arsenal, which is why the expert perception is that DeepSeek has power equivalent to its competitors, but undisclosed for now. $NVDA - MUSK SUGGESTS DEEPSEEK 'OBVIOUSLY' HAS MORE NVIDIA GPUS THAN CLAIMED Elon Musk and Alexandr Wang suggest DeepSeek has about 50,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, not the 10,000 A100s they claim, due to U.S. export controls. Musk, with experience from xAI, agrees with Wang's… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 27, 2025 Compared to OpenAI's GPT-o1, the R1 manages to be around five times cheaper for input and output tokens, which is why the market is taking this development with uncertainty and a surprise, but there's a pretty interesting touch to it, which we'll talk about next, and how people shouldn't panic around DeepSeek's accomplishment. NVIDIA has generated gigantic revenue over the past few quarters by selling AI compute resources, and mainstream companies in the Magnificent 7, including OpenAI, have access to superior technology compared to DeepSeek. Given that DeepSeek has managed to train R1 with confined computing, imagine what the companies can bring to the markets by having potent computing power, which makes this situation much more optimistic towards the future of the AI markets. There's no competition to NVIDIA's CUDA and the surrounding ecosystem, and it's safe to say that in the world where AI is emerging as a growing technology, we are just at the start. DeepSeek's implementation doesn't mark the end of the AI hype. Rather, it shows us the untapped potential of the technology, although the markets aren't taking this development with much optimism, as Team Green has managed to shave $300 billion+ from its market cap after DeepSeek's R1. But, we expect the dust to settle, once people realize the positive outcome of the situation. Moreover, this will prompt companies like Meta, Google and Amazon to speed up their respective AI solutions, and as a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst says, DeepSeek's achievement should rather turn us more bullish towards NVIDIA and the future of AI.

Title: Shiba Inu Community Highlights 10 Reasons Why SHIB ETF Approval Is Inevitable
URL: https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-community-highlights-10-reasons-why-shib-etf-approval-is-inevitable/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T14:27:49Z
Full Content:
As the Trump administration’s crypto executive order takes effect, expectations are rising for more Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2025. Among these anticipations, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful that a SHIB ETF could soon gain approval. In a tweet on Monday, “Shibizens” a Shiba Inu-focused news platform, outlined ten reasons why major financial institutions like BlackRock and Grayscale should list a SHIB ETF. Notably, the platform highlighted SHIB’s “massive market opportunity,” driven by its global base of over 1.3 million holders. It also pointed to Shibarium’s operational Layer 2 blockchain, which supports diverse use cases in gaming, DeFi, and utility tokens such as BONE and TREAT. The platform further emphasized SHIB’s affordability, which appeals to retail investors and expands the potential client base for institutional players. Its high liquidity and trading volume add to its stability, while the broad range of assets within the Shiba Inu ecosystem offers strong diversification prospects. Additionally, Shibizens argued that the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs sets a powerful precedent, demonstrating robust demand for crypto-based investment products. “Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have shown strong demand. SHIB, as a next-generation blockchain project, is a logical step to capture the growing appetite for diversified crypto products.” It wrote. As per the platform, SHIB’s commitment to social causes, exemplified by the Shib Karma Foundation, also resonates with ESG-conscious investors. Additionally, with its global reach and innovative blockchain approach, SHIB positions itself as a forward-thinking investment. In conclusion, the platform argued that introducing a SHIB ETF would play a key role in driving the next wave of crypto innovation while strengthening the position of issuers as forward-thinking leaders in wealth management. “By launching a SHIB ETF, companies like BlackRock can capitalize on emerging crypto trends, meet growing investor demand, and establish themselves as leaders in digital asset management,” It added. This surge in optimism follows the SEC’s approval of similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum last year. Notably, after the spot ETH ETF approval last May, Shiba Inu’s pseudonymous lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, sent a congratulatory message to Ethereum, cryptically hinting that SHIB could be next in line. Lucie, a leading spokesperson for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has also consistently advocated for the potential of a SHIB ETF. Last July, she expressed strong confidence, stating, “Do I think a SHIB ETF will happen? Most definitely,” citing growing institutional interest in SHIB’s decentralized framework. Last week, Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas suggested that more cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for TRUMP and DOGE, are likely to be approved before April, a move that could open doors for others like SHIB. That said, despite the SEC’s lack of indication regarding meme coin ETFs, the SHIB community remains resolute. Campaigns continue to apply pressure on asset managers to front such products to the SEC, with a Change.org petition led by the SHIB army aimed at Grayscale already attracting over 11,000 signatures.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

Title: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about Big Tech earnings. New developments from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech names prompted a pause in the US AI trade. Nvidia stock dropped more than 16%. Meanwhile, fellow "Magnificent Seven" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, fell over 17%. "When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis," Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. "That’s exactly what we’re seeing today." A slowdown in Big Tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice. "You have so much concentration in one area of the market — this has been the AI dominant themed market — and all of a sudden you bring in some uncertainty to that market, the initial reaction is to sell first and ask questions later," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, DeepSeek's new AI model appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through. "The biggest risks are the ones that we're not talking about," Lerner said. "And everyone thinks it's tariffs and China. And, you know, really, what we're finding out is [DeepSeek] wasn't on anyone's bingo card." In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, Big Tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the "Magnificent Seven" is expected to slow in the first quarter before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter. Lerner reasoned that Monday's sell-off brought investors "back to fundamentals." "Washington matters, but there's other factors, in totality, that will likely matter more," Lerner said. "Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: The End of ESG

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber "Sustainability" investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn't just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel's stock fell 60% last year...SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Society KEYWORDS: wokeism 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber When companies spend time sucking up to LEFTIST politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:02:11 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline.

"Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline.

This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability."

Title: The Nasdaq sinks more than 800 points as a China AI threat sparks a huge tech stock sell-off
URL: https://qz.com/nasdaq-nvidia-tech-stocks-deepseek-ai-djia-sp500-1851748172

Full Content:
The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Read more: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China’s DeepSeek rattles AI investors Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” The sell-off was led by Nvidia, whose stock fell as much as 16% Monday afternoon. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 16% Monday afternoon after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek’s latest model raised questions about American competitiveness in the AI space. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. And last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Fundamental Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best fundamental stocks to buy now. The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period. In other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President’s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market’s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets. Investors are also relieved that the President has only made threats on the tariff front, rather than taking formal action, during his first few days in office.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company. Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery. Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility. Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

Title: Pro-Crypto Policies Surge As Banks Lag—Here’s How They Can Catch Up

Go ahead and continuously improvement concept, silhouette man jump on a cliff from past to future ... [+] with cloud sky background. The landscape of digital assets is undergoing a significant shift as pro crypto regulatory clarity begins to take shape. Policymakers are moving faster than the price of Bitcoin. In recent weeks, significant developments, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) withdrawal of the contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) via SAB 122 and President Trump’s January 23, 2025 Digital Assets Executive Order, signal a bullish trajectory for crypto policies. Meanwhile, traditional banks, burdened by outdated frameworks and resistance to the emerging digital asset industry, risk establishing their foothold in this rapidly evolving sector. SAB 121, introduced during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tenure, required financial institutions to account for customer-held crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. While purportedly intended to protect investors from insolvency risks, critics lambasted the guidance as overly punitive and impractical for innovation. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce quickly celebrated the SEC’s decision to revoke SAB 121in an X/Twitter post, and bid SAB 121 “a not-so-fond farewell”. SAB 122 directs firms to follow FASB and international accounting standards, which better suit the evolving crypto landscape. Peirce highlighted that this change removes a regulatory barrier, fostering innovation and collaboration between crypto firms and financial institutions. This rollback reduces operational burdens and encourages institutional participation, paving the way for broader crypto adoption. On the heels of the SEC announcement came President Trump's much-anticipated Digital Assets Executive Order. This policy framework overhaul addresses longstanding issues, including the legal categorization of digital assets, taxation, and cross-border applications​. The EO outlines key pillars aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection: These measures signal the administration’s recognition of blockchain technology's potential to revolutionize finance and other industries. In stark contrast to the policy momentum, traditional banks remain ensnared in skepticism and operational inertia, much of which can be attributed to prudential regulators’ admonitions. Documents obtained by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request initiated by Coinbase revealed that U.S. regulators informally discouraged banks from expanding crypto services, despite officially denying a policy of "debanking"​​, also referred to within the crypto industry as Chokepoint 2.0. While crypto adoption surged globally, most banks have failed to innovate their offerings. Their hesitancy contrasts starkly with the likes of Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, which are actively expanding crypto-based investment products​​. As regulatory clarity improves, banks must pivot quickly to avoid irrelevance. Opportunities include: Collaborating with fintech and blockchain startups: Banks can integrate blockchain to enhance cross-border payments and real-time settlement systems. Investing in crypto infrastructure: Developing secure custodial services and compliance solutions will attract institutional clients exploring crypto markets. Educating stakeholders: From brokers to customers, knowledge-building is critical to bridge the gap between traditional finance and emerging technologies​​. Failure to adapt will likely result in a widening gap between innovators and incumbents, where fintech players dominate while banks struggle to maintain relevance. The SEC's revised stance and the administration's pro-crypto policies underscore the urgency for financial institutions to adapt. While regulators open the door for innovation, banks are at a crossroads: evolve or be left behind. As the digital asset revolution accelerates, the institutions that embrace this paradigm shift will shape the future of finance, while those clinging to legacy models risk extinction. While many banks have hesitated to embrace the digital assets revolution, others have positioned themselves as trailblazers, leveraging crypto innovations to secure a foothold in the industry. However, the stark contrast between public rhetoric and private actions among certain institutions reveals a hypocrisy that cannot be ignored. Some financial institutions have embraced the crypto wave, proactively adapting their models to stay ahead of the curve. Fidelity Investments stands out as a pioneer in institutional crypto adoption. Since launching Fidelity Digital Assets in 2018, the company has offered secure custodial services and direct access to bitcoin for institutional investors. Fidelity was also among the first to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada and played a key role in the U.S. debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, when nine new spot Bitcoin ETFs and two conversions hit the market, collectively drawing $1.9 billion in inflows during their first three days of trading, according to Reuters. Similarly, Goldman Sachs, once a crypto skeptic, has now emerged as a player in legitimizing digital assets within traditional finance. The bank operates a robust digital asset desk, offering clients access to cash-settled derivatives, options, and futures tied to Bitcoin. According to Mathew McDermott, Goldman’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the firm has developed a comprehensive suite of crypto products to meet growing institutional demand. In the second quarter of 2024, Goldman made its debut in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, purchasing $418 million worth of bitcoin funds, including a $238 million stake in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. The bank also disclosed positions in ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, and Invesco, as detailed in CNBC’s coverage of its Q2 filings. In stark contrast, Bank of America (BoA) has been a notorious laggard. While quietly filing for blockchain-related patents for years, the bank has publicly downplayed the potential of cryptocurrencies. BoA’s leadership has repeatedly warned clients of crypto's volatility, characterizing it as a “speculative bubble.” Despite these claims, the bank's internal research division acknowledged in a 2021 report that blockchain technology could fundamentally reshape finance. BoA’s inconsistency underscores its struggle to reconcile crypto's potential with its conservative stance​​. In a recent Squawk Box interview during Davos 2025, BoA CEO Brian Moynihan hedged his bets regarding institutional adoption of crypto, acknowledging BofA and other banking incumbents may have to adopt crypto payments given the regulatory shift. Wells Fargo has similarly been slow to act. Although offering limited crypto-related investment products to wealthy clients in 2021, years behind competitors, the bank has focused primarily on cautionary narratives about crypto fraud and environmental concerns rather than embracing innovation. The bank’s approach began to pivot in 2024, permitting bitcoin ETF investments for clients who specifically requested access. Additionally, according to DeCrypt.co, paperwork filed with the SEC shows that the bank had purchased shares of Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF, and that it also has exposure to Bitcoin Depot Inc., a Bitcoin ATM provider. Perhaps the most striking example of hypocrisy lies with JPMorgan Chase. For years, CEO Jamie Dimon has been one of bitcoin’s most vocal critics, famously calling it a “fraud” in 2017 and warning that it would “blow up.” Publicly, Dimon continues to maintain a stance of disdain for cryptocurrencies, repeatedly labeling them as speculative assets with no inherent value. However, JPMorgan has been integrating blockchain and digital asset into its operations for years. The bank developed JPM Coin (now rebranded Kinexys Digital Payments), a digital token designed to facilitate instant cross-border payments for institutional clients, showcasing its faith in blockchain technology for real-world applications. Moreover, JPMorgan has become a key player in the Bitcoin ETF space, serving as an authorized participant for the Blackrock bitcoin ETF (IBIT). JPMorgan's dual approach—public skepticism paired with internal adoption—highlights a troubling trend among some legacy institutions. These banks publicly criticize cryptocurrencies, discouraging retail clients from participating with brash headlines, while leveraging the same technology to bolster their institutional offerings and operational efficiencies. This pattern of public disdain and private opportunism is more than a marketing inconsistency; it undermines trust. As retail investors increasingly notice this duplicity, they may shift loyalty to forward-thinking incumbents, fintech startups, crypto-native institutions that offer transparency and alignment with the industry's ethos. Banks that remain insincere about their crypto involvement risk alienating a growing segment of clients who view blockchain technology as the future of finance. Transparency and trust are paramount in the new digital asset economy. As digital assets evolve, banking professionals face a clear choice: adapt or risk irrelevance. While some institutions have embraced blockchain technology, many still lag in understanding and integrating crypto into their services. Here’s how banking professionals can stay competitive: Crypto and blockchain are no longer fringe concepts. Banking professionals must understand blockchain’s foundational concepts, including cryptocurrencies, DeFi (decentralized finance), and NFTs. Staying informed about regulatory updates from the SEC, CFTC, IRS and prudential regulators is also critical. Internal continuing education and client education is key. Blockchain’s value extends far beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key applications include: To meet evolving client needs, banks must innovate. Priority areas include: Rather than reinventing the wheel, banks should collaborate with fintech startups and blockchain companies to accelerate adoption. Partnerships can fast-track blockchain implementation in clearing, settlements, and lending. With increasing regulatory clarity, compliance can be a competitive advantage. By proactively addressing anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), and taxation requirements, banks can position themselves as trusted leaders in the crypto space. Internal inertia is often a bank’s biggest obstacle. Leadership must prioritize innovation by recruiting blockchain experts, upskilling staff, and piloting crypto-related projects. The digital assets landscape in the United States and beyond is evolving rapidly, creating both opportunities and challenges for financial professionals. With regulatory clarity improving, including the Digital Assets Executive Order and the withdrawal of SAB 121, the path is clear for broader institutional adoption. Traditional banks can no longer justify a head-in-sand approach and now face an urgent and unavoidable crossroads: embrace innovation to lead in this new financial era or cling to outdated models and risk obsolescence. Financial professionals must act now to build the expertise, infrastructure, and partnerships needed to thrive. Those who hesitate may find themselves sidelined in this new digital asset economy.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

On January 22, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays shared his stance on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The analyst highlighted that the stock has been struggling for the past year. However, O’Malley believes that AMD’s investments in AI will allow the company to achieve year-over-year growth of a few billion dollars for MI series accelerators in 2025. He also added that the company will have to wait a little longer to garner opportunities for additional market share. Despite that, the analyst gives an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $140, adding that the stock may potentially gain 12% in the coming months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Trump’s RTO edict raises concerns over morale, efficiency — and burnout
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3808863/trumps-rto-edict-raises-concerns-over-morale-efficiency-and-burnout.html
Time Published: 2025-01-27T11:00:00Z

President Donald J. Trump’s executive order to federal employees to return to the office “as soon as practicable” will have a variety of repercussions — most of them negative, according to industry analysts and others. The return-to-office (RTO) policy issued last week signals Trump’s intent to fulfill campaign promises to reform the 2.3-million-strong federal workforce, which he has criticized as inefficient and bloated. The language in Trump’s order doesn’t clarify whether it applies only to the estimated 10% of federal civilian workers — about 228,000 as of May 2024 — who work remotely full-time, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Trump may be upping the stakes, but then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed legislation Jan. 5 designed to bring more federal employees back to the office and increase the efficiency of office space utilization. Both men were likely taking cues from various businesses that have instituted RTO mandates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Tesla and SpaceX chief executive CEO Elon Musk — now a close advisor to Trump — delivered an RTO ultimatum to his two companies’ white-collar workers: get back in the corporate office or face firing. Musk’s letter to executive staff at the time specified: “The office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Other corporations have followed suit more recently. In December, Amazon and AT&T ended their work-from-home policies. AT&T went so far as to tell 9,000 of its 149,000 workers to relocate to an office area or be fired. Peter Miscovich, managing director at global real estate firm JLL, said the US is entering a “hybrid winter,” as many CEOs impose RTO mandates that could pose talent attraction and retention challenges for leading IT organizations. That’s especially true for advanced tech leadership teams and IT departments that have built sophisticated hybrid work practices over time and invested significantly in hybrid operational technologies and related infrastructure across global organizations, he said. “Perhaps the most significant risk associated with RTO mandates is the potential loss of valuable and critical IT digital talent,” Miscovich said. “The IT tech sector has embraced hybrid work more thoroughly than most industries, and IT professionals now view hybrid workplace flexibility as a standard expectation for the workforce rather than a perk.” Over the past two or so years, remote work — once praised as the new paradigm for productivity and employee satisfaction — began losing some of its luster as more organizations required workers to get back to their cubicles, at least part time. In fact, many organizations are already struggling to fill a significant IT talent gap. In some cases, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has been able to replace needed workers; in most other instances, the dearth of tech talent remains. According to new research from the University of Pittsburgh, S&P 500 companies that rolled out RTO mandates experienced “abnormally high” employee turnover and longer time-to-hire when filling job vacancies. “This significant IT digital talent brain-drain risk is particularly acute given the current competitive market for technology talent,” Miscovich said. In 2025, CIOs and senior IT leaders face growing challenges when trying to attract top talent while maintaining operational excellence and managing workplace transformation amid RTO mandates, according to Miscovich. Resistance to the mandates is especially strong in global IT departments where hybrid and remote work are deeply integrated and have proven highly effective. John Veitch, dean of the School of Business and Management at Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, California, said RTO mandates are “generally” a sign of insecure leadership. In other words, executives don’t trust what they can’t see. RTO mandates say, “I have to see people working and earning their living,” he said. Veitch didn’t have strong feelings either way about RTOs involving the federal government workers, though from a workflow point of view, he said he’s not convinced there are benefits. He agreed that with the tech marketplace unemployment rate near historic lows, it could push some workers out the door, he said. “I don’t think the federal government pays particularly well relative to what you can get if you’re a top-flight technologist at a Silicon Valley firm,” Veitch said. “Obviously, people who have options will choose those options, particularly if return-to-office is a deal breaker for them. So, I don’t think it’s going to help the government in any way, shape or form to retain talented people.” Further research points to other problems with RTO mandates. Being in the office five days a week leads to higher rates of burnout, lower morale, and inefficiencies associated with commuting time, according to J. P. Gownder, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. On average, US workers spend 2.3 days in the office each week, according to a Stanford University study. A separate Stanford study found that hybrid work had zero effect on workers’ productivity or career advancement and dramatically boosted retention rates. In general, hybrid working arrangements hold numerous advantages over full-time, in-office, Gownder said, and for non-collaborative work, home offices are far better suited because they create “a focused environment.” “Despite some managers’ concerns, employees who work in hybrid fashion are more productive than those who spend all their time in the office. Most employees engage in a mix of personal and collaborative work,” he said. In fact, hybrid work boosts employee productivity, performance, and retention, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. Because of RTO mandates, employees are often forced to commute in only to do tasks they could handle at home. Even in the office, many still rely on videoconferencing to collaborate with colleagues in other locations. As a result of that and other inconveniences, organizations that move from hybrid work to full-time in-office work can expect higher attrition rates, Gownder argued. “Sometimes, managers impose these policies specifically to drive higher attrition, in lieu of layoffs,” he said. “IT talent often can work effectively remotely, and attrition rates in general are higher among IT professionals.” Additionally, the federal government and private companies have a dramatically smaller number of offices to which they could return as many companies have consolidated their footprints to a few key hubs. AT&T, for example, ordered 60,000 managers to work from one of only nine offices, forcing 9,000 employees to relocate or resign. As the pandemic eased in 2022 and 2023, US core business centers in large and small cities continued to suffer the after-effects of remote- and hybrid-work policies, which led to a 20% to 40% reduction in office space use and a devaluation of properties. The big switch to remote work left many downtowns largely empty for months. Data indicates that approximately 80% of offices had downsized by the end of 2023. Other sources indicate the downsizing slowed last year and by Q4 2024 office leasing rates were at about 92% of pre-pandemic levels, according to David Brodeur-Johnson, employee experience research lead at Forrester Research. “And yes, I believe that firms would be willing to expand their office spaces as needed to keep up with capacity, but most aren’t there yet,” he said. While most organizations adopted a hybrid-work policies, requiring employees to be in the office a few days each week while allowing work from home on other days, the Trump Administration’s policies are a strict, five-day RTO. That’s likely to incur an employee backlash, Brodeur-Johnson said. The federal government, he said, risks employee disengagement more than attrition. Monitoring federal employee surveys like FedRamp will be crucial, as disengagement is costly for both employees and employers. “It’s important to bear in mind also that autonomy is a primary source of intrinsic motivation — the kind that comes from within — so I would argue strongly that the biggest negative impact will likely be to employee engagement instead of attrition,” Brodeur-Johnson said. Academic studies also show that strong social relationships are key to remote work success, with emotional closeness outweighing physical distance. But simply being in the office doesn’t promote social relationships, Brodeur-Johnson pointed out. “Which is why companies like Nvidia have left it up to employees to decide, up to and including fully remote work,” he said. “How close people feel to each other emotionally is far more important than physical distance.” While Trump’s executive order could spark a wider look at RTO edicts elsewhere, most private companies have settled on what their employees will tolerate. Meanwhile, federal agencies have steadily increased in-office requirements, so the latest change shouldn’t be a surprise, Brodeur-Johnson said. But for some workers — especially those with care-giving duties or better flexible job options — it could be the tipping point. Top talent might leave first, which is why RTO mandates have slowed recently, he said. Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.

Looking back, 2024 was a spectacular year for the crypto world, marking a transformative milestone in technology, markets, and ecosystems. It will be remembered as a landmark chapter in the crypto history, with surging institutional interest in crypto assets, technology innovations, regulatory advancements and Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new heights fuelled by the crypto friendly Trump administration. We just entered the new year 2025. For me it is a tradition to deliver a blog in which I present the main trends for the new year on blockchain and crypto. This blog that will be somewhat longer than normal, dives into the core trends that will further shape the crypto market in 2025 and beyond. thereby increasingly transforming traditional finance. I Existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption A first trend we will see is that in 2025 existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption. Most important are tokenised real world Assets (RWA), DeFi, crypto ETFs as well as the introduction of more stablecoins. Tokenised RWAs reshaping finance One of the most significant trends in 2024 reshaping finance is the tokenisation of real-world assets, like property, commodities, real estate and securities, attracting both investors and companies from of a range of industries. This is transforming traditional finance, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in the financial markets to various assets classes. By converting real world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenisation is unlocking new investment opportunities and making traditionally illiquid assets, such as real estate, more accessible.to a wider range of investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, making them tradable even in small fractions, allowing investors to buy and sell portions of assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for traditionally nonliquid assets The trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) is expected to take off in an accelerated way in 2025 hitting critical mass, revolutionizing how traditional finance interacts with blockchain technology. 2025 will push the boundaries of what can be tokenized. From medical data to personal biometrics, tokenizing assets once deemed untouchable will unlock new markets and create unprecedented opportunities for digital value. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): reaching all-time highs Decentralized finance (DeFi) that refers to financial services built on blockchain networks that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks, has exploded over the past few years. They provide decentralized alternatives to banking, lending, and trading. But this is just the beginning. DeFi is projected to expand significantly in 2025 and beyond, remaining a dominant force in the crypto space. Tokenized securities and high-value assets will thereby catalyse DeFi’s growth, attracting both retail and institutional investors, adding new liquidity and utility. The DeFi sector could benefit from further integration with traditional financial systems, allowing for seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, and DeFi platforms such as automated market makers (AMM's) and decentralised exchanges (DEX's) become more mature and more user-friendly, it is likely that a growing number of investors will turn to these services for flexible lending and borrowing solutions. This year the DeFi market could reach a $100 billion valuation as more platforms solidify their roles within the ecosystem, more than double compared to 2024.. Increased Market Share of Crypto ETFs Crypto ETFs have seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in January 2024. This marked a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market, paving the way for traditional financial players to include these products in their portfolios without the need for navigating crypto exchanges and wallets. This approval already provided a massive inflow of institutional capital, with Bitcoin’s price seeing a notable boost above $100.000, following the announcement of Trump’s presidential victory. The emergence and growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could continue through 2025, significantly accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin ETFs would get more inflows than ever before and maybe reach $40–50 billion this year. The popularity of these ETFs might greatly improve the situation of Bitcoin on the market. Building on the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the more crypto friendly Trump administration, this year could mark a turning point for other cryptocurrency ETFs. There are currently over 10 ETF applications, including Solana (SOL) and XRP, pending review by the SEC for assets signalling the potential for expanded institutional interest in a broader range of digital assets. Such ETFs and other ETPs may continue to increase liquidity and stability in the blockchain and digital asset market. Stablecoins for Enterprise Adoption Last year the stablecoin market showed firm growth, triggered by the rising demand for digital assets that offer the stability of traditional fiat currencies. The stablecoin market could double in size by the end of 2025 reaching $ 400 billion, reflecting increased adoption and integration into various traditional financial systems. The stablecoin market's significant growth in 2024 and projected expansion in 2025 highlight its integral role in the digital transformation of the financial landscape. This is based on broader acceptance of digital payments, advancements in blockchain technology, and increased regulatory clarity. Stablecoins facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a hedge against the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. They also provide access to financial services for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure, promoting greater economic participation. More institutional interest in the crypto world This year is gearing up to be a pivotal year, especially when it comes to institutional blockchain and crypto adoption. In 2024 we already have seen a growing institutional interest in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) and ETFs, thereby recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Major companies have already made Bitcoin and other important cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets, while institutional investors are starting to see digital currencies as a viable store of value Major payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, while major players in the financial world like Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are entering the RWA space, signalling growing confidence in the potential of blockchain technology to transform traditional asset markets. The trend of traditional institutions entering the crypto space is expected to continue during 2025 in an accelerated way. Asset managers, hedge funds, and large corporations will likely increase their exposure to crypto assets as part of diversified portfolios. Institutional adoption is expected to reach new heights.T he volume of institutional crypto investments could surpass the $500 billion mark, driven by demand for regulated investment vehicles, including ETFs and structured products. As institutional investors continue to show interest, we may see further innovations in cryptocurrency-related products, such as bitcoin loans. These types of loans allow institutions and individuals to leverage their crypto holdings without selling them, offering a more efficient way to access liquidity. II Arrival of new blockchain services Other interesting trends to expect in 2025 is the growing adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and the arrival of new blockchain related services such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Growing Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (Baas) Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud based platform with which companies may implement and use blockchain solutions. In 2024, BaaS matured significantly, becoming a key component for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without the complexity of developing and the need of managing their own complex infrastructure. By simplifying the acceptance of blockchain BaaS trends in the technology. Accessibility and accessibility will be stimulated. BaaS will become an important trend in 2025, where big technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon offer blockchain services (infrastructure and maintenance). With BaaS companies may chose the most suitable blockchain protocol for their needs. Going forward, more companies might adopt BaaS platforms, which could lead to increased application in supply chain management, finance and health care. Launch of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another significant trend on the horizon. These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

Looking back, 2024 was a spectacular year for the crypto world, marking a transformative milestone in technology, markets, and ecosystems. It will be remembered as a landmark chapter in the crypto history, with surging institutional interest in crypto assets, technology innovations, regulatory advancements and Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new heights fuelled by the crypto friendly Trump administration. We just entered the new year 2025. For me it is a tradition to deliver a blog in which I present the main trends for the new year on blockchain and crypto. This blog that will be somewhat longer than normal, dives into the core trends that will further shape the crypto market in 2025 and beyond. thereby increasingly transforming traditional finance. I Existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption A first trend we will see is that in 2025 existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption. Most important are tokenised real world Assets (RWA), DeFi, crypto ETFs as well as the introduction of more stablecoins. Tokenised RWAs reshaping finance One of the most significant trends in 2024 reshaping finance is the tokenisation of real-world assets, like property, commodities, real estate and securities, attracting both investors and companies from of a range of industries. This is transforming traditional finance, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in the financial markets to various assets classes. By converting real world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenisation is unlocking new investment opportunities and making traditionally illiquid assets, such as real estate, more accessible.to a wider range of investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, making them tradable even in small fractions, allowing investors to buy and sell portions of assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for traditionally nonliquid assets The trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) is expected to take off in an accelerated way in 2025 hitting critical mass, revolutionizing how traditional finance interacts with blockchain technology. 2025 will push the boundaries of what can be tokenized. From medical data to personal biometrics, tokenizing assets once deemed untouchable will unlock new markets and create unprecedented opportunities for digital value. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): reaching all-time highs Decentralized finance (DeFi) that refers to financial services built on blockchain networks that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks, has exploded over the past few years. They provide decentralized alternatives to banking, lending, and trading. But this is just the beginning. DeFi is projected to expand significantly in 2025 and beyond, remaining a dominant force in the crypto space. Tokenized securities and high-value assets will thereby catalyse DeFi’s growth, attracting both retail and institutional investors, adding new liquidity and utility. The DeFi sector could benefit from further integration with traditional financial systems, allowing for seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, and DeFi platforms such as automated market makers (AMM's) and decentralised exchanges (DEX's) become more mature and more user-friendly, it is likely that a growing number of investors will turn to these services for flexible lending and borrowing solutions. This year the DeFi market could reach a $100 billion valuation as more platforms solidify their roles within the ecosystem, more than double compared to 2024.. Increased Market Share of Crypto ETFs Crypto ETFs have seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in January 2024. This marked a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market, paving the way for traditional financial players to include these products in their portfolios without the need for navigating crypto exchanges and wallets. This approval already provided a massive inflow of institutional capital, with Bitcoin’s price seeing a notable boost above $100.000, following the announcement of Trump’s presidential victory. The emergence and growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could continue through 2025, significantly accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin ETFs would get more inflows than ever before and maybe reach $40–50 billion this year. The popularity of these ETFs might greatly improve the situation of Bitcoin on the market. Building on the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the more crypto friendly Trump administration, this year could mark a turning point for other cryptocurrency ETFs. There are currently over 10 ETF applications, including Solana (SOL) and XRP, pending review by the SEC for assets signalling the potential for expanded institutional interest in a broader range of digital assets. Such ETFs and other ETPs may continue to increase liquidity and stability in the blockchain and digital asset market. Stablecoins for Enterprise Adoption Last year the stablecoin market showed firm growth, triggered by the rising demand for digital assets that offer the stability of traditional fiat currencies. The stablecoin market could double in size by the end of 2025 reaching $ 400 billion, reflecting increased adoption and integration into various traditional financial systems. The stablecoin market's significant growth in 2024 and projected expansion in 2025 highlight its integral role in the digital transformation of the financial landscape. This is based on broader acceptance of digital payments, advancements in blockchain technology, and increased regulatory clarity. Stablecoins facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a hedge against the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. They also provide access to financial services for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure, promoting greater economic participation. More institutional interest in the crypto world This year is gearing up to be a pivotal year, especially when it comes to institutional blockchain and crypto adoption. In 2024 we already have seen a growing institutional interest in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) and ETFs, thereby recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Major companies have already made Bitcoin and other important cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets, while institutional investors are starting to see digital currencies as a viable store of value Major payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, while major players in the financial world like Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are entering the RWA space, signalling growing confidence in the potential of blockchain technology to transform traditional asset markets. The trend of traditional institutions entering the crypto space is expected to continue during 2025 in an accelerated way. Asset managers, hedge funds, and large corporations will likely increase their exposure to crypto assets as part of diversified portfolios. Institutional adoption is expected to reach new heights.T he volume of institutional crypto investments could surpass the $500 billion mark, driven by demand for regulated investment vehicles, including ETFs and structured products. As institutional investors continue to show interest, we may see further innovations in cryptocurrency-related products, such as bitcoin loans. These types of loans allow institutions and individuals to leverage their crypto holdings without selling them, offering a more efficient way to access liquidity. II Arrival of new blockchain services Other interesting trends to expect in 2025 is the growing adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and the arrival of new blockchain related services such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Growing Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (Baas) Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud based platform with which companies may implement and use blockchain solutions. In 2024, BaaS matured significantly, becoming a key component for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without the complexity of developing and the need of managing their own complex infrastructure. By simplifying the acceptance of blockchain BaaS trends in the technology. Accessibility and accessibility will be stimulated. BaaS will become an important trend in 2025, where big technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon offer blockchain services (infrastructure and maintenance). With BaaS companies may chose the most suitable blockchain protocol for their needs. Going forward, more companies might adopt BaaS platforms, which could lead to increased application in supply chain management, finance and health care. Launch of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another significant trend on the horizon. These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones.

Some analysts maintain that altcoins could still outperform Bitcoin despite a delayed start of the rally. Per the Ethereum [ETH] MVRV Pricing Bands, each bullish cycle saw ETH surpass the 3.2 MVRV Pricing Band, indicating strong investor optimism and market momentum during these periods. At press time, ETH’s price was at $3,330, which was significantly below the 3.2 MVRV band priced at $6,770. This discrepancy suggested that while ETH was valued reasonably in terms of its historical realized price, it hasn’t reached the euphoric valuation peaks as in past bullish cycles. The bands at lower MVRV ratios, like 0.8, 1.0, and 2.4, sit at $1,693.33, $2,116.66, and $5,080.00 respectively, serving as potential support levels during market retractions. Source: Ali Charts/X Considering this, ETH could see significant upside potential if it approaches and surpasses the 3.2 band in future bullish conditions. This would not only reflect growing market confidence but also suggest a possible continuation of ETH’s uptrend in coming cycles. Additionally, ETH’s resistance indicated critical turning points where ETH either faced a pullback or a breakthrough. Breaking past this, then followed by a substantial uptrend, could suggest a bullish continuation. Ethereum appeared to be approaching this level once again, which could trigger a rally towards $6770. This move could be in line with historical cycles where Ethereum gathered significant momentum after crossing the MVRV threshold. Source: TradingView A successful break past the resistance could lead to a surge in buying activity. This is supported by the fact that BlackRock now holds over 1.2M ETH through its Spot ETF, while Fidelity’s FETH holds 432K ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW holds 105K ETH. The inflows suggest rising institutional demand. Finally, analysts are having different views on ETH, probably because of the delayed altseason. Michael van de Poppe called it the “most hated rally” suggesting a surprising bullish run, one that market sentiment did not initially favor. Also, Joao Wedson noted that altcoins have already dropped significantly, so it’s likely that many will recover and outperform Bitcoin. This predicted rally could coincide with a growing interest in “real utility coins,” or cryptos that offer functional, real-world applications. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2025–2026 As institutional interest in utility-focused tokens increases, their adoption could boost demand for Ethereum, given its key role in the blockchain ecosystem. As ETH approaches the MVRV value again in 2025, sustaining institutional embracement could lead to a strong uptrend, defying initial market skepticism and solidifying its position in both market valuation and utility.

U.S. stocks notched back-to-back weekly gains last week and although the rally paused on Friday, the S&P 500 still hit a fresh record during the day. It comes after the U.S. leader called for lower interest rates and cheaper oil prices in a Thursday address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Investors have also been betting on potential tax cuts and deregulation under the new president, sending stocks higher. Not everyone is bullish looking ahead, however, with some — such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon — suggesting markets could be overpriced. After a week of interviews with business leaders, lawmakers and investors in the Swiss ski resort, here's what top industry names told CNBC: "I'm cautiously optimistic — that being said I have scenarios where it could be pretty bad," Fink told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. "I believe if we were to unlock all this private capital we're going to have enormous growth, [but], at the same time, some of this is going to unlock new inflationary pressures," he explained. "And I do believe that's the risk that is not factored into the market." Pick said he believed corporate earnings could lift growth in markets over the next 12 to 24 months as they "continue to be strong." "That is kind of the indicator … How many companies right now are really talking about recession, how many are talking about inflation? I feel like the earnings pull through looks pretty sanguine," he said. "More importantly, I know we like to look at the index, but the index is dominated by half a dozen technology companies — which, by the way are all doing great — but if you look at the deregulation possibilities in the energy sector, in the financial services sector, those sectors are still in multiples that aren't that expensive," Pick added. "If you're an investor and you think about allocating over the next 12 to 18 months, sure there could be a drawdown at the index level, but [do] you really want to be thinking about where do I have sector exposure?" Lagarde told Karen Tso that there was divergence in monetary policy between the euro area and the U.S. due to a "different economic setting." She also said that she was not "overly concerned" about the risk that inflation abroad will be imported into Europe, adding that she expected the ECB will continue to gradually lower interest rates as the price growth rate moves toward target. "We are certainly interested to see the U.S. grow, because growth in the U.S. has always been a favorable factor for the rest of the world," Lagarde said. "I don't think you should give any advice to the U.S., but if you look at the risk to financial markets, I think inflation is for sure one, all driven by tariffs," Tangen said Tuesday. "Geopolitical tensions generally are negative for financial markets and for financial returns." Tangen added that "purely financially," Trump's arrival was going to be "very positive" for a lot of U.S. companies. Dimon said he thinks U.S. asset prices are "kind of inflated" at their current levels. "By any measure, they are in the top 10% or 15%," Dimon told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Wednesday, referring to U.S. stock markets. "They're elevated and you need fairly good outcomes to justify those prices. "We're all hoping for that, and having pro-growth strategies helps make that happen, but there are negatives out there and they can tend to surprise you," he added. Solomon said markets were in risk-on mode and that there was a sense of optimism in equities both because of the new U.S. administration and because of advances in technology. Solomon also told Andrew Ross Sorkin that he was noticing a focus on growth, in the U.S., as well as in his conversations with European clients at Davos. "I think people are optimistic, and it's not going to be a smooth, perfect path, but people are optimistic that we are going to run a more growth-prone agenda. We're going to free up some investment, we're going to unlock the private sector a little but more, and that's got to be constructive," he said. "It's hard to dispute the fact that equity multiples are high ... I think the equity markets exhibit a sense of optimism at the moment, but they also exhibit a sense of optimism around growth and technology, in particular this AI wave. Of course it's not going to be a straight line, but some of the technology we're seeing, the opportunities for that technology to improve productivity meaningfully are extraordinary." "Continuing on the trends we've seen in 2024 being a positive year in most markets … I see that continuing in 2025, I see a continuation of strong tailwinds in the in the core markets, the U.S., Asia, particularly the growth driven markets in Asia," al-Mubarak told CNBC's Dan Murphy Monday. "I see a continuation of good tailwinds in technology and healthcare and financial services, life sciences," he added. "So I would say, maybe almost the same words I used last year: cautiously optimistic. When I look at 2025, it's going to be an exciting year." Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told CNBC that price-earnings ratios were high in U.S. markets, but that there could be further scope to climb in artificial intelligence beneficiaries. "We have gone pretty far already ...I think it's led by the sectors that are great sectors, the disruptors, AI and so on." "I don't think it's been carried down to the applications of AI, to the uses of AI ... the applications of AI are under-discounted I think." Moynihan told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Tuesday he thought U.S. markets had room to climb in 2025, and that the key concern for business and financial services would be regulatory policy, rather than inflation. "Our research team thinks there's room to go this year, they predict the market to go up. Not as much as last year, and the unusual thing is you had a couple years in a row of very strong growth, but that was coming off a couple years of very unusual times," he said. Moynihan added, "I believe that if you look at the key thing for businesses generally, including financial services and the banking businesses, it's the regulation question." Tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump could prevent disinflation and keep interest rates higher, the banking chief told Andrew Ross Sorkin on Tuesday. "Inflation is much more sticky than we have been saying," Ermotti said. "Tariffs will probably not really help inflation to come down. And therefore I don't see [interest] rates coming down as fast as people believe," he said. Venkatakrishnan, whose British bank makes around 40% of its revenue in the U.S., said he was "optimistic" about U.S. deal activity this year. "I think there are two things driving it. One is interest rates have reached a relatively stable level. Our own economists are calling for maybe one rate cut in the U.S. over the next year," he told Andrew Ross Sorkin. "They're still high, but they're stable, so you can at least plan better, because you don't have the volatility in rates. The second is with the change in [U.S.] administration, it should be easier for mergers to take place." Venkatakrishnan added that he expected President Trump to relax regulation, which would be "generally good for business sentiment and good for business opportunity." The U.K. needs to attract more oversees investment to boost economic growth, Reeves told CNBC. "My message to U.S. investors and global investors too is: Britain is open for business, we want your investment." She also discussed Trump's global tariff threats. "I do understand that President Trump is concerned about countries that are running large and persistent surpluses on the trade balance with the U.S. That's not the case for the U.K.," Reeves said. "We are not part of the problem here. So we, the U.K., increased trade with President Trump last time he was in office." Sinding, CEO of Swedish private equity firm EQT, told CNBC's Karen Tso and Steve Sedgwick on the ground that the market for M&A and big business deals was "continuing to improve." "We had a record year in 2024 we did over $20 billion of investments," he said. "We did more than $10 billion of exits, and that's kind of building up to 2025, [when] I think a lot of the market participants are now ready to transact, whether it's private equity or family offices or strategic buyers. And, of course, if you look at the global capital markets, the IPO market is wide open. The credit markets are strong, so we're fairly positive looking into the next year."

Title: Trump is searching for potential TikTok buyers

President Donald Trump wants a US investor to take a major stake in ByteDance’s TikTok. Several parties are in contention even as potential buyers face a litany of legal hurdles and barriers. After stepping in to restore TikTok in the US and delaying a law that would effectively ban the app, Mr Trump is looking for avenues to keep the popular platform afloat. He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50 per cent stake to the US government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. Mr Trump reportedly said Saturday that he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and that he would likely decide on its future in the next 30 days. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Mr Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world’s richest person is leading Mr Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Mr Musk acquire TikTok’s US operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok’s chief executive had been soliciting advice from Mr Musk ahead of Trump’s inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Mr Musk for comment. “Elon Musk continues to be front and centre as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done,” financial services company Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Wednesday. “Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view,” the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Mr Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, he also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. “Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny,” Ms Schindler said. Mr Trump has also said he’d “like” to see Oracle chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform. Mr Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans last Tuesday, where Mr Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. “What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we’ll give you the permit,” Mr Trump said before turning to Mr Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. “Sounds like a good deal to me Mr President,” Mr Ellison replied. Mr Ellison and his company are currently at the centre of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the US. Given its existing relationship with TikTok, Oracle and is “directly invested in TikTok’s success in the region,” Scotiabank’s Ms Schindler said. Mr Ellison had bid for TikTok, along with Walmart, back in 2020 when Mr Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC’s request for comment. Mr Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would’ve seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the US, avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration’s attempt to ban TikTok in the US fell through in the face of legal challenges. Mr Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Mr Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. ″[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate,” Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Mr Musk and Mr Ellison leading the pack. According to a National Public Radio report on Saturday, the Trump administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that would involve Oracle and a group of outside investors effectively taking control of it global operations. California-based artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid for TikTok to ByteDance on January 18, as it seeks to create a new merged entity combining Perplexity, TikTok US and new capital partners, CNBC learned. Following Mr Trump’s comments on a TikTok deal structure, the AI company revised its merger proposal on Sunday to also allow for the US government to own up to 50 per cent of the new company upon future IPO, according to a proposal document seen by CNBC. The document proposes ByteDance offer TikTok US, without its recommendation algorithm, in exchange for the company’s existing investors receiving equity in the merged company. The deal would reportedly bring more video to Perplexity — recently valued at about $US9 billion ($14.3b) — as it gains increasing investor interest amid the generative AI boom and competes with OpenAI and Google. Experts flagged several other parties likely to be interested in a potential deal for TikTok, adding that the barriers to entry were high. Given the financial stakes of a TikTok deal, it’s unlikely that some rogue investor is going to swoop in and buy the platform on the cheap, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group told CNBC. “While an up-to-date valuation on TikTok is difficult to come up with, it is likely to the order of $US40b-$US80b, meaning whoever decides to jump in has to be ready with some serious money,” he said. He added that potential suitors are likely to include some of America’s largest social media and technology players, such as Meta and Google, in addition to Mr Musk’s X. Meta and Google didn’t immediately respond to a CNBC inquiry. Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, however, warned that players such as Meta, Google and Mr Musk getting a substantial stake in TikTok could raise antitrust questions. Ms Schindler noted that there were also a number of other players, including existing investors BlackRock, Coatue, and General Atlantic, who own a large chunk of TikTok’s parent company. According to him, some of these investors are likely to participate in any sale of the US platform by investing in the new entity. “Other large VCs, hedge funds, and asset managers from Tiger to Fidelity would also likely show interest in a fast growing global platform with such a huge viewer base,” said Schindler, adding that finding investors to own a part of Tiktok won’t be a problem. The fervour surrounding a purchase of TikTok US has also seen some unconventional players enter the fray. Social media superstar MrBeast — real name Jimmy Donaldson — who has more than 100 million TikTok followers has posted several videos in which he indicated serious interest in buying the platform, claiming he has had talks with billionaires. In one video, the internet personality claimed he had an official offer ready, jesting that he might be the new TikTok CEO. Media reports have also mentioned Mr Donaldson and a group of investors preparing to make a bid for TikTok. On Thursday, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesperson for Mr Donaldson, told CNBC that: “Several potential buyers are in ongoing discussions with Jimmy, but he has no exclusive agreements with any of them.” Led by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt and involving Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O’Leary, The People’s Bid for TikTok, has made a $US20b cash offer to buy TikTok. Mr O’Leary told CNBC last year that he wanted to buy the platform at a discount as any possible deal won’t include TikTok’s original algorithm. The organisation said it already has a replacement for the algorithm to use for TikTok US. Following Mr Trump’s comments on a 50 per cent stake in the platform, both Mr McCourt and Mr O’Leary told CNBC this week that they were interested in a TikTok deal and were hoping to work with Mr Trump to make it happen. Mr McCourt has also told CNBC that he wants TikTok to run a decentralised social networking protocol, or DSNP, overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, a non-profit founded by the billionaire. Bidding interest aside, a number of legal and tech experts have told CNBC that Mr Trump’s executive order to delay the TikTok ban contradicts the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling to uphold the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and could face legal opposition. Mr O’Leary also told CNBC last Monday that a TikTok deal could not happen under the current law, after the Supreme Court upheld an impending ban on TikTok under the Act on Sunday. Beijing and its pending negotiations with Mr Trump regarding trade with the US is also expected to play a determining factor in whether the Chinese government would allow ByteDance to make a divestiture. “In this game of high stakes poker between the Trump administration and Beijing it’s clear TikTok is a big chip on the table,” Wedush said.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Forecasts $700K Bitcoin Price Amid Inflation Worries
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-forecasts-700k-bitcoin-price-amid-inflation-worries/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
EditorCrypto bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Mark Mason Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has suggested that Bitcoin could reach $700,000 per coin, citing its growing role as a hedge against economic instability. His projection, sparked by a discussion with a sovereign wealth fund, highlights the increasing momentum of institutional adoption and its potential to reshape market dynamics. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently speculated that Bitcoin could potentially reach valuations as high as $700,000 per BTC. This projection arises against the backdrop of intensifying concerns about currency debasement and global economic instability, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems. Fink’s remark was not an outright endorsement but rather a reflection on a recent meeting he had with a sovereign wealth fund. The fund sought advice from Larry Fink on whether to allocate 2% or 5% of its investment portfolio to Bitcoin. According to Fink, if institutional adoption continues to grow and similar allocation strategies are embraced broadly, market dynamics could drive Bitcoin to such remarkable heights. Fink made this striking statement during a recent interview, explaining that Bitcoin’s potential for exponential growth is closely tied to fears of economic downturns and fiat currency devaluation. Fink described Bitcoin as an “international instrument” capable of mitigating localized economic fears. JUST IN: $11.5 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says Bitcoin could go up to $700,000 if there is more fear of currency debasement and economic instability.pic.twitter.com/WOXclAsjDP With BlackRock managing $11.5 trillion in assets, Larry Fink’s words carry significant weight, sending a clear message to retail and institutional investors alike. His endorsement transcends personal opinion, serving as a market signal about Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Long heralded as “digital gold,” Bitcoin is seen as a store of value that can protect wealth from inflation and governmental fiscal mismanagement. Fink’s recognition of this narrative could further accelerate its adoption among traditional investors. Larry Fink’s prediction comes as global economies grapple with soaring inflation, escalating national debts, and geopolitical tensions that threaten currency stability. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins and decentralized structure, presents an alternative asset class that is immune to the inflationary pressures inherent in fiat currencies. In this climate, its value proposition becomes increasingly compelling. BLACKROCK IS BACK.THEY JUST BOUGHT $600 MILLION OF BITCOIN, THEIR LARGEST BUY SO FAR THIS YEAR. pic.twitter.com/QLAm5eaik4 BlackRock’s deepening involvement in Bitcoin reached a milestone on January 21, 2025, when the firm purchased $662 million worth of Bitcoin for its exchange-traded fund (ETF), their largest daily purchase so far this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) surpassed the firm’s iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in net assets in October 2024. This milestone was achieved just months after IBIT’s launch in January 2024, highlighting the rapid growth and increasing investor interest in Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds led by Larry Fink. While Larry Fink’s projection is undeniably bullish, it remains contingent on the continuation of current economic trends. If global economic stability improves or innovative financial systems emerge to alleviate fears of currency debasement, Bitcoin’s price trajectory may stabilize at a lower level. Nevertheless, Fink’s high-profile commentary underscores its growing role as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital experiment to a mainstream financial instrument is accelerating. Fink’s remarks may signal a pivotal moment, not just for Bitcoin, but for its broader acceptance in traditional finance. For investors and enthusiasts, this is more than a vote of confidence—it’s a sign that the integration of Bitcoin into the global financial landscape is not only imminent but already underway. As the world watches, Larry Fink’s prediction about Bitcoin’s role in redefining finance continues to grow. Fink’s prediction serves as a reminder that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea but a crucial player in the future of money.

Title: Playing To Win: The Pros And Cons Of Workplace Competition
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/26/workplace-competition-pros-cons/
Time Published: 2025-01-26T21:30:00Z
Full Content:
Workplace competition has pros and cons. Workplace competition is inevitable in a corporate environment with an inherent pressure to outperform peers. Whether vying for promotions or bonuses, employees are in a constant race to climb the corporate ladder. Many organizations foster a competitive spirit in the hopes of driving productivity and innovation. When encouraged in the proper way, workplace competition can be beneficial. Yet, that same tactic can backfire if unhealthy rivalries result in a negative or hostile work environment. Competition in the office is more widespread than most people think. In a survey by ResumeLab, over 80% of respondents admit to experiencing workplace competition. While the majority (69.6%) describe the competition with co-workers as being healthy, just over 30% feel the competition is toxic. Co-workers who are considered healthy competition are referred to as “positive rivals.” The research revealed that employees with a positive rival are twice as likely than those with a negative rival to believe their organization creates an environment of healthy competition. Whether workplace competition results in a positive or negative experience depends on how leaders motivate employees. When competition makes employees feel excited, it can induce creative behaviors. On the other hand, if it causes workers to feel anxious and fearful, it could lead to unethical actions. Let’s review the pros and cons of workplace competition and how to create a balanced culture that generates positive outcomes. Fostering healthy workplace competition can boost employee engagement. For example, creating fun contests can help keep workers motivated. When your team feels inspired, they will work harder and be more productive. Competition also encourages people to learn new skills and go outside the scope of their roles. They feel challenged, which often contributes to greater performance. When that happens, it’s also easier for managers to identify individuals who display the leadership and initiative to be considered for promotions. Encouraging a competitive environment at work can drive creativity and team innovation. When the pressure to outperform peers builds, workers are motivated to think outside the box and strive for excellence. In a competitive workplace, the desire to innovate is constant. As a result, pursuing fresh ideas often leads to breakthroughs that might not occur in a strictly collaborative setting. Companies like Google, Amazon and Tesla are examples of organizations where workplace competition has been known to drive transformation and increase efficiency. When managed properly, workplace competition can generate higher-quality work output. The competitive environment helps guide employees to drive toward a goal. Their desire to outperform co-workers increases their focus and motivates them to pursue excellence. As teams put in more effort to impress their managers, work quality increases. If workplace competition is focused on negative outcomes, like the threat of layoffs or being publicly humiliated, it can create a toxic environment. Depending on the individual, the stress and anxiety associated with excessive competition can also breed hostility and negatively impact mental health. Finally, intense competitiveness can erode team unity as employees focus more on individual success than what will benefit the organization as a whole. When competitiveness at work results in a distrustful environment, collaboration is discouraged. Another downside is that some team members might perceive the competition as unfair, which can bring about conflicts. New employees, in particular, may feel discouraged if they think the expectations are unreasonable. When team members distrust leadership, it can result in disengagement over time. Depending on the individual, a highly competitive work environment can cause some people to act dishonestly. For example, if a sales executive is feeling the pressure to reach virtually impossible targets, they might sabotage a colleague’s work or manipulate data. When workplace competition becomes too intense, employees might even take credit for other people’s work to achieve a better performance review. Ultimately, these negative behaviors damage the company’s long-term reputation and team morale. Workplace competition can be a double-edged sword. While it sometimes motivates employees, it can also have the opposite effect. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, the determining factor is how employees respond emotionally. If they interpret their feelings as anxiety, they are more likely to behave unethically. Yet, when they feel excited, they are apt to leverage creative behaviors to problem-solve. Fundamentally, how workplace competition makes people feel plays a crucial role in how they try to succeed. By leading with a positive attitude, managers can maintain a competitive spirit that makes employees feel nurtured and valued. One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year’s outcome for the country and globally. The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook. To curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey’s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Top 5 Sectors To Invest In 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-26T18:00:00Z

These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation ... [+] and market demand. The investment landscape in 2025 offers several promising opportunities in high-growth sectors. While market volatility continues to be a challenge, certain areas stand out for their strong growth potential, technological innovation, and ability to address critical global issues. This analysis, supported by comprehensive market research and economic indicators, highlights five sectors worth investors' attention. Successful investing in specific sectors requires analyzing several factors that indicate sustainable growth potential. These criteria are essential for making informed investment decisions based on solid fundamentals rather than market sentiment. Market trends involve both cyclical patterns and long-term changes in the economy. Key factors include trading volumes, price movements and sector rotation patterns. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates are vital in understanding market movements. For instance, the U.S. economy grew by 2.1% in 2024, but inflation rates stabilized around 3.4%, affecting sectors differently. Shifts in global trade dynamics, such as increased trade agreements in Asia and the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, are shaping investment opportunities. Innovation remains a critical driver of growth. Metrics such as R&D spending, patent applications, and the pace of new product development highlight sectors leading in technological advancements. According to recent reports, global R&D spending reached $2.5 trillion in 2024, with industries like artificial intelligence and clean energy receiving a significant share of this investment. Companies that innovate consistently are better positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. Analyzing global demand patterns helps identify growth trajectories. Demographic trends, such as aging populations in developed markets and growing middle classes in emerging markets, shape consumption patterns. For example, India’s GDP growth is projected to exceed 6.3% in 2025, driven by increased domestic consumption and infrastructure spending. These factors create opportunities for sectors like healthcare, advanced manufacturing and clean energy. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations are now central to evaluating sector performance. Sectors aligned with sustainability goals often benefit from supportive regulations and growing consumer demand for responsible business practices. In 2024, global ESG-focused assets under management surpassed $40 trillion, demonstrating the increasing investor focus on sustainability metrics such as carbon footprints, resource efficiency and governance standards. The sectors identified here were selected using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Financial indicators such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on invested capital (ROIC) were paired with assessments of market positioning, competitive dynamics and regulatory environments. As we head into 2025, identifying the right sectors to invest in is more important than ever. With shifting economic trends, emerging technologies and evolving consumer habits, certain industries are positioned to outperform others. In this section, we’ll explore five sectors that offer strong potential for growth and resilience in the year ahead, backed by market trends and data-driven insights. Whether you’re looking for stability or high-growth opportunities, these sectors deserve a closer look The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) sector is growing rapidly, with applications spreading across healthcare, finance and logistics industries. Major players are consolidating their market positions through acquisitions of innovative startups. AI adoption is accelerating, supported by technological advancements and increased investment. According to PwC, AI-driven technologies will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to ensure ethical AI usage, further boosting the sector's credibility. Clean energy has transitioned from an alternative option to a mainstream necessity. Advancements in battery technology and storage solutions have addressed previous challenges in adopting renewable energy. Governments worldwide are committing to net-zero emissions targets. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 continues to funnel billions into clean energy projects, and declining costs of renewable installations make this sector highly attractive. The healthcare technology sector encompasses digital health platforms, advanced diagnostics, and personalized medicine. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions while biotechnology continues to innovate. An aging population and rising healthcare costs are driving demand for innovative solutions. According to the WHO, global healthcare spending reached $10.3 trillion in 2024, highlighting the importance of this sector. As cyber threats grow in complexity, the cybersecurity sector is evolving rapidly. Comprehensive security platforms now incorporate AI-driven tools, zero-trust architectures and cloud-native solutions. Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR in Europe and increased focus on data privacy in the U.S., drive demand for robust cybersecurity solutions. Gartner predicts that worldwide spending on cybersecurity will exceed $200 billion by 2025. Technologies like industrial robotics, 3-D printing, and smart factories are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes. Supply chain disruptions in recent years have accelerated the adoption of automated solutions. Rising labor costs and the need for supply chain resilience have made automation a priority. According to McKinsey, automation could add $1.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030. These five sectors offer substantial opportunities for investors looking to align with innovation and market demand. While the potential for high returns exists, diversification and risk management are critical to navigating market volatility. Before investing, assess company fundamentals, valuation metrics, and broader economic conditions. Staying informed and monitoring trends within these sectors will be key to long-term success in 2025.

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks. Even though the year 2024 was not kind to certain sectors within the US economy, the broader outlook for the stock market heading into the new year was more than rosy. Investment banks generally anticipated moderate economic growth for the US in 2025. For example, Deutsche Bank forecasts a growth rate of approximately 2%, noting that 2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth. Meanwhile, JP Morgan's Global Investment Strategy team emphasized a foundation of strength stemming from 2024's robust market returns. They highlighted themes such as easing global policies and rising capital investment as key drivers for the coming year. Their report, Outlook 2025: Building on Strength, suggested that the US economy was well-positioned to capitalize on these favorable conditions. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, inflation remained a focal point in economic discussions. Top economic experts project that inflation rates will decelerate in 2025, approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target by the second half of the year. This outlook suggests a stabilization of price levels, which could influence monetary policy decisions. US Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino offered insights into the Federal Reserve's anticipated actions. She predicted that the Fed would implement two interest rate cuts in 2025, citing continued economic strength. Bovino also noted that proposed tariffs and tax cuts by the new administration could exert additional inflationary pressures, potentially complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The fiscal policies of the new administration are expected to play a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. Bank of America analysts Claudio Irigoyen and Aditya Bhave discussed the interplay between US policy changes and the global economy. They anticipated that fiscal policy would be expansionary through tax cuts and acknowledged that proposed tariff increases could have a modest impact on consumer price inflation. Their analysis underscored the importance of balancing growth initiatives with inflation control. In terms of sector performance, Standard Chartered Bank expressed optimism about equities and commodities. Entering 2025, the bank was overweight in equities and gold, citing a resilient global economy with a projected GDP growth of 3%.

Diluted earnings per share was $12.36 on a GAAP basis and $18.42 on a non-GAAP basis. Secondly, the company has teamed up with artist and culinary author Benny Blanco to create a collection of customizable marketing templates for Adobe Express, the company’s powerful yet user-friendly design app. This collaboration aims to empower small businesses, including restaurants, to easily create eye-catching content that stands out both online and in person.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 130.92 points, or 0.3%, to close at 44,156.73. READ ALSO: 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Best Sin Stocks to Invest in 2025. President Trump also recently announced a joint venture named “Stargate,” involving OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, to invest at least $500 billion in AI infrastructure within the US. Stocks rose because of solid earnings reports and investors continued to pile into the AI space following this recent announcement by the new administration. Keith Lerner, Truist’s co-chief investment officer, pointed out that a combination of a resilient economy, easing inflation, stabilizing of interest rates, and a strong start to the earnings season has created a favorable environment for the market. He noted that AI and technology continue to be key drivers of this bull market. Another key factor playing a role in this market rally is the optimism around Trump’s agenda. Investors are hoping that Trump will ease regulations and reduce corporate taxes, which could lead to an increase in profits. To compile our list of the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 2025, we used the Finviz stock screener to look for stocks that analysts believe will gain more than 30% in the next 12 months.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO) have almost doubled over the past year. Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return. Join thousands of data-driven investors – Build your Smart Portfolio for personalized insights. I last wrote about Broadcom in December 2024, when the stock was trading at $162 per share, with the stock currently 50% higher since then. The past year was great for long-term bulls, but investors who had their eye on the stock without pulling the trigger may be feeling some sententious FOMO (the fear of missing out) right about now. Fret not; yield-seeking, dividend-loving, capital-gains-hunting tech-savvy portfolio holders. Despite its monumental one-year run, it’s not too late to invest in Broadcom. I’m bullish on the company despite the upward re-rating, based on its history of generating exceptional long-term returns, the massive growth potential of the AI chip market, and its compelling track record as a strong dividend growth stock, all of which make it an appealing opportunity for long-term investors. The primary reason why it’s not too late to invest in Broadcom after its big year is because its recent metrics are nothing new for the stock — Broadcom is a long-term performer, not a flash in the pan. In fact, over the past decade, Broadcom has generated a stellar total return of 2,850% for investors, far exceeding broader benchmarks. While it has been a good decade for equity investors, the S&P 500 (SPX), as represented by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), has generated a total return of 256% over the same period, meaning that Broadcom generated ~10x the return of the broader market. An investor who put $10,000 into Broadcom 10 years ago would have an investment worth $280,500 today, while an investor who put $10,000 into VOO would have an investment worth $25,584 today. Even when looking at the more tech-centric Nasdaq 100 (NDAQ), Broadcom has outperformed. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) has generated a strong 456% total return over the past decade, but this strong performance still pales in comparison to Broadcom’s stellar return. Winners tend to win for a reason, and they tend to keep winning over time, which gives me confidence that it’s not too late for investors to add Broadcom to their long-term portfolio. While the law of large numbers means Broadcom’s returns are unlikely to match those of the previous decade in the years ahead, the stock is well-positioned to deliver strong results (and returns) for its shareholders. Broadcom’s spectacular performance over the years has somewhat overshadowed the fact that it is also an outstanding dividend stock, ranking in the top three in a recent TipRanks’ Best Dividend Stocks comparison. While shares yield just 1%, below the 1.3% average yield for the S&P 500, the company has a solid record of growing its dividend payout. Broadcom has paid dividends to shareholders for 14 consecutive years and has increased its nominal payout yearly. Moreover, the semiconductor maker has grown its dividend at an impressive 14% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. The company also maintains a conservative dividend payout ratio of under 50%, so there is ample room to increase the dividend as earnings increase. While today’s 1% yield may look underwhelming, this penchant for dividend growth means that long-term shareholders will likely enjoy a superior yield-on-cost as the company continues to grow its dividend payout over the long term. Broadcom is a major player in AI chips, and while this market has garnered more hype than substance so far, there is strong reason to expect growth in this sprawling sector in the years ahead. Precedence Research estimates that the size of the AI chip market totaled $73 billion in 2024 and expects it to grow at a remarkable 29% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next decade, reaching $928 billion by 2034. Obviously, a lot can happen between now and 2034, so these numbers are best taken with a few grains of salt, but they illustrate the scale of the likely market for AI chips in the long term. Broadcom predicts that the company can haul in $60-90 billion in sales of its custom AI chips in 2027, up from an AI revenue base of $12 billion in 2024. Given this massive growth potential, it’s unsurprising that analysts also forecast Broadcom to achieve continued earnings growth in the years ahead. Wall Street analysts expect Broadcom’s EPS to grow 30% to $6.35 per share in 2025 before ramping up a further ~20% to $7.65 in 2026 and reaching $9.10 in 2027. Turning to Wall Street, AVGO has received a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst AVGO stock price target of $237.08 per share implies a 2.15% potential downside from current levels. See more AVGO analyst ratings Broadcom stock has almost doubled in value over the past 12 months, but long-term tech-focused investors who didn’t pull the trigger on AVGO a year or so ago mustn’t develop MOFO or regret missing the boat. The stock is a perennial darling for shareholders with an exemplary history of generating strong cumulative returns for years on end. I remain bullish on Broadcom based on its excellent track record and its compelling history of dividend growth. While the AI chip market has, to some degree, been lifted by market hype, we are still in the early innings of the AI story, which leaves ample potential for the future, especially for investors with a long enough investment horizon to commit to a resilient trend-setter in the early days.

Title: Top 10 enterprise technology predictions: What’s coming in 2025

UPDATED 12:11 EST / JANUARY 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and new territory. In this Breaking Analysis, we put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. Every year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and we categorize them. The picture below gives you a sense of how many inbound predictions we review. Each year the folder gets larger. Below we show the change in topic areas over the past three years. Remarkably, artificial intelligence, while still prominent, was second this year after cybersecurity. Now in fairness, many of the security predictions involved AI, but it’s notable that generative AI last year propelled AI to the top category with 40% of the inbounds and cyber, which dropped as a percentage of the total last year, has shot back to regain the top spot it held in 2023. As well, cloud and data center grew after last year’s decline and, surprisingly, data continued its downward trend — surprising because there’s not much AI you can do without data. We had several inbound predictions around DevOps but fewer than in past years, and digital transformation, once the buzzword of the day, has all but disappeared from the predictions narrative. Software as a service is still showing some life and, as with cybersecurity, the SaaS inbounds were sprinkled with AI throughout. And the “Other” category remained noticeable with topics around edge, public policy, jobs, social issues and the like. Most of the inbounds were more trends than predictions but there were a few that stood out. Just to give you a taste: The email subject line on predictions from Kevin Cochrane, the chief marketing officer of Vultr Inc., was Vendor Predictions that Don’t Suck. Cochrane predicts the following two items: We’ll see. The hyperscalers are likely to remain fairly walled with massive ecosystems that will allow them to claim openness through choice. And in our view they will get their piece of the sovereign AI pie. Another standout was from Zencoder Chief Executive Andrew Filev, who predicted massive coder productivity increases via agents culminating in the following prediction: And one more from Tarun Desikan of SonicWall Inc., who predicts: We hope this last prediction misses the mark! As a reminder, last week we hosted the “Data Gang” with a number of predictions around data platforms and related topics. OK, let’s move on to this year’s predictions from theCUBE Research and ETR. Above is a glance at all our predictions for this episode on one chart. They span macro tech spending, security, agentic AI, cloud computing, edge, intelligent automation, initial public offerings, data and jobs. We won’t spend too much time on this graphic, but it will give you a quick overview of this year’s menu. Each quarter ETR conducts its TSIS survey with Ns ranging from 1,500 to more than 1,800 on the above chart that measures expectations all the way back to the COVID era. As shown above, we came out of the isolation economy with very high expectations of 7.5% growth and that steadily decelerated as the war in Ukraine and the Fed tightening actions kicked in. We finished 2024 at just around 4%, which was a little lower than we predicted last year, and we enter 2025 with a 5.3% growth expectation from information technology decision makers. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Enterprise IT spending has shown signs of recovery following a period of uncertainty tied to macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. Though headlines warned of an impending recession, technical indicators never confirmed it, and new IT projects are now re-emerging. Our research indicates that overall budgets are on the rise, buoyed in part by a generally business-friendly environment and easing regulatory concerns, though a degree of unpredictability remains. In particular, small and medium-sized businesses are outpacing larger enterprises in spending, and optimism among C-suite executives is running higher than that of front-line practitioners. Bottom line: We believe the data points to a gradual but genuine revival of enterprise IT investment and an underlying tone of positivity given the new administration in the United States. Nonetheless, pockets of uncertainty remain — particularly around inflation, regulatory shifts and geopolitical dynamics. Over the coming quarters, we expect organizations will revise forecasts to reflect evolving market signals. The past three years have shown actuals coming in below expectations although the delta is compressing in what remains an unpredictable macro environment. Our second prediction goes right to the top topic of our inbounds, security. We’re predicting that despite the fact that organizations tell us they struggle to reduce the number of tools in their security stack, the idea of platformization will continue to gain traction in 2025 and become a more prominent theme amongst buyers. Above we show a graph that compares the spending profiles of dozens of security platforms. Net Score or spending momentum is shown on the vertical axis, with Overlap or presence in the data on the horizontal plane. The table inserted in the bottom right informs how the dots are plotted (Net Score by Ns in the survey for each vendor). Note that the graphic is both crowded and there’s lots of green, meaning spending on many vendors’ tool sets continues. Microsoft Corp. stands out in the upper right, and Wiz Inc. is well above the 40% line which we consider highly elevated. Zscaler Inc. and Snyk Ltd. are also above that line The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our research indicates that by 2025, organizations will gravitate toward consolidated cybersecurity platforms, as intensifying threats and mounting complexity make best-of-breed approaches increasingly unsustainable. Nation-state actors now have access to compute at scale and AI capabilities, resulting in continuous, more sophisticated attacks that demand tighter integration and simplified management. Bottom line: We believe that by 2025, the intensity of cybersecurity threats will drive a widespread shift toward consolidated, platform-centric solutions. Although specialized tools will persist where differentiation is critical, the data suggests that simplicity, integration and ease of management will be the guiding principles for CISOs looking to reduce risk and maintain agile, secure environments. Our next prediction focuses on the buzzword of the day: agentic AI. We predict that there will be no “aha moment” foagentic AI in 2025 because security and data privacy concerns will be a headwind. Now, to be clear, we are excited about agentic. We just feel the hype is a bit ahead of reality. There are clear successes taking shape in companies such as Salesforce Inc., ServiceNow Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Workday Inc. Admittedly, there are mixed reviews around Microsoft copilots. Nonetheless, agents are being infused into all SaaS products. We look at agents as the next instantiation of large language models. Rather than prompts from just humans, agents will be pounding LLMs, enabling them to take action based on data context. This will increase the velocity of prompts by orders of magnitude and, as the AI stack evolves, multiple components of the AI stack will need to be secured and managed. Stitching these pieces of the stack together involves risks, creates seams and will be a blocker that needs to be addressed. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We see a growing yet cautious embrace of agentic AI across the enterprise. The positives in the data are that nearly half of surveyed organizations report some level of return on investment, and more than 86% plan to boost AI spending in the coming year. But notable hurdles exist. Specifically, organizations must address security, privacy and intellectual property concerns before AI-based agents achieve broader traction and deliver transformative impact. Bottom line: We believe that enterprise interest in agentic AI is genuine and growing, but organizations will not in 2025 experience a broad-based “aha moment” where these technologies become indispensable and trusted. Addressing security concerns, improving user training and refining real-world applications will be critical factors in driving AI from pockets of success to pervasive, transformative use. Our next prediction relates to the narrative around cloud repatriation. We think that the so-called cloud re-patriots are going to shift their marketing and focus instead on bringing AI to the data on-premises. The data we’re showing above underscores that cloud repatriation is really not a massive trend. Sure, 15% of the customers in this survey are repatriating some workloads, but it’s not an overwhelming revenue generator. A more viable approach in our view is a narrative around bringing AI to the data. And we think that will overtake the repatriation narrative. In a recent CUBE Research survey, we found that 58% of respondents plan to build their AI in their own private data centers. Customers tell us they love Amazon Web Services, they love Bedrock, they love Google LLC’s AI and they’re all Microsoft users. And when we ask why then are you building your own on-prem AI capabilities, they say: 1) That’s where much of our data lives; and 2) The cloud is expensive. And this all will lead to a discussion on edge which we’ll address in our next prediction. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our research indicates that the trend toward large-scale “cloud repatriation” remains more of a vendor marketing point than a significant market shift. While approximately 15% of organizations report moving some workloads back on-premises, the bulk of enterprise workloads that reside in the cloud will grow in the cloud. Bottom line: We believe that, while certain targeted workloads may move back on-prem for specific business or technical reasons, the cloud continues to dominate infrastructure strategies. The data suggests that repatriation is largely an edge case rather than a widespread reversal of the cloud adoption wave. Our next prediction is around the edge. We see AI inference at the edge showing measurable revenue progress in 2025. Edge computing will be a significant trend in 2025 that will shape and evolve the AI narrative. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We anticipate a surge in edge computing adoption by 2025, driven by the growing need to process data in real time, directly at the source. This trend underpins industries like robotics, manufacturing (Industry 4.0), full self-driving vehicles and retail, all of which demand low latency and rapid decision-making. Our research indicates that edge will not replace or detract from public clouds or on-premises environments. Instead, we expect edge to function as a complementary layer, feeding data to centralized locations for broader analytics and AI training. Bottom line: We believe edge computing will see strong momentum in 2025 as enterprises seek to speed up real-time insights while preserving the ability to leverage the cloud for large-scale analytics. The data suggests that this “cloud plus edge” model offers the best of both worlds: ultra-low latency for time-sensitive operations and centralized infrastructure for advanced AI workloads. Above we show ETR’s XY data format, Net Score by Overlap or penetration in the data set. Microsoft is in the upper right of this chart and will hit close to $200 billion in cloud revenue this year, all in. AWS will surpass $130 billion and Google will come in at about half of that. But as you see on this ETR chart, Salesforce will contribute $50 billion or so. It’s interesting to see CoreWeave Inc. on this. It’s a new name on the survey and it doesn’t appear to be setting the enterprise world on fire. Perhaps this is a case where model trainers rather than enterprises are using its stack at this point. The bar chart insert shows the all-in cloud revenue for infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and SaaS from theCUBE Research over time and is projected to surpass $1 trillion in 2025. The chart below provides additional survey detail and suggests that cloud spending is outpacing overall spending. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our customer survey research shows cloud spending (IaaS and Paas) growing at nearly double digits — around 9.5% — while SaaS, the second-highest category, lags behind at roughly 4.5%. Despite incremental price increases from cloud providers (averaging around 3%), the insatiable need for compute continues to push organizations to invest more heavily in cloud services. This trend underscores our view that large-scale repatriation remains a limited phenomenon. Bottom line: We believe the continued double-digit cloud growth and climbing levels of high-end spending confirm that organizations remain deeply committed to cloud infrastructure. Despite concerns about pricing or sporadic examples of repatriation, the data suggests that companies’ appetite for compute resources—in a large part fueled by AI—will keep the cloud market on a steady upward trajectory and all-in will surpass $1T in 2025. Next up is a prediction that is maybe a bit counterintuitive. Specifically, we think AI supercharges robotic process automation and is not a replacement. Early on, customers were thinking that gen AI in particular could do what RPA does but we don’t see it that way. In fact in many ways we look at RPA as very useful plumbing for enterprise AI and automation. Customer data suggests that they see AI as complementing RPA and capabilities such as process mining, process mapping, workflow optimization and the like will support agentic workflows. In the ETR XY chart above, you can see Microsoft Power Automate in the upper right and a number of other firms such as UiPath Inc., which is positioning for agentic with agent management frameworks and strong process knowledge. Others on this chart are positioning for agentic AI as well and we’re particularly excited about Celonis SE, which we’ve covered quite extensively on this program. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We see a resurgence in RPA spending and business process automation initiatives, despite initial concerns that AI would render traditional RPA obsolete. Rather than displacing RPA, emerging AI capabilities are proving complementary, giving rise to “intelligent automation” solutions that enhance the breadth and depth of what can be automated. Bottom line: We believe that RPA’s return to favor reflects its evolving role within a broader automation strategy. Rather than being displaced by AI, RPA is bolstered by these new capabilities, creating powerful, end-to-end automation solutions that promise enhanced efficiency and agility for organizations that embrace the synergy. Our next prediction is that IPOs will begin to come back in the first half, but really those companies that need the money will go out. We think others will wait to see the impact of the Trump administration, what happens with interest rates and the like. Above we’re showing a sit-down we had at our NYSE studio with Veeam Inc. CEO Anand Esweran. Veeam is owned by Insight Partners, which just did a private raise to prepare for what we believe will be an IPO later this year or more likely in 2026. Veeam doesn’t need the cash so it isn’t in a rush. Blue Yonder Group Inc., Snyk and the well-funded Databricks are other candidates. In addition, we’re watching firms such as Cohesity Inc., Cerberus Systems Inc., Klarna Bank AB, CoreWeave, Chime Financial Inc., Netskope Inc., Neo4j Inc., Stripe Inc. and Celonis. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We foresee a surge in IPO activity among technology firms that have been taken private in recent years or have remained in the private domain. Rising interest rates, lofty private valuations and the eventual need for liquidity events are converging to create a ripe environment for public offerings. Major private equity players such as Thoma Bravo and Vista, which acquired numerous software companies, are now incentivized to return these assets to public markets, much like the recent announcement involving SailPoint Technologies Inc. Bottom line: We believe that the combination of liquidity needs, rising interest rates, and sustained investor appetite for innovative tech solutions will drive an uptick in IPOs. Expect many of the names previously taken private or still in private hands to test the public markets as they seek funding for expansion, returns for backers, and the chance to better compete in an evolving landscape. We believe the point of control will clearly shift from the database up the stack towards governance catalogs that control open table formats. But the value will we think leapfrog that layer further up into the application stack, with agentic AI taking center stage, notwithstanding the security challenges we cited earlier. Above we show data from an August ETR. The gray bar is the one that is relevant where Iceberg, despite its newness, leads with 40% of customers at that time planning to use Iceberg. We think this trend will dramatically accelerate in 2025 with Delta and Iceberg merging via Databricks’ acquisition of Tabular. As the point of control shifts up the stack, the data platform players such as Snowflake Inc. and Databricks will increasingly run into the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow and other SaaS players that are taking greater control over the data that lives within their application stacks. These SaaS platforms not only have data but they have process knowledge, business logic and metadata, and are in a strong position to vie for control of the data. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We believe the next phase of data and AI evolution will move beyond separating compute from storage and cloud scalability. Increasingly, we believe the emphasis will be on how organizations refine, harmonize and govern data — rather than just where that data resides. In recent years, enterprises have focused heavily on laying foundational infrastructure for real-time analytics and AI. Now, our research suggests investment is shifting toward customer-facing applications and sophisticated data management layers, including semantic solutions that harmonize data, data catalogs and governance frameworks. Bottom line: We believe that as enterprise data ecosystems become more fluid — where any compute engine can tap into any data source — governance, discoverability and semantic consistency will define market winners. Though Databricks and Snowflake appear to be leading the charge, hyperscalers remain well-positioned thanks to their scale and go-to-market muscle. Ultimately, organizations seeking to stay competitive must invest in advanced data management and semantic tooling that aligns real-time processing with broader AI objectives. Our last prediction is one that addresses some of the media hype around jobs. We don’t believe AI will dramatically kill jobs in 2025 and spike unemployment. And we think that longer-term, AI will create more jobs that require different skill sets. This data we’re showing above is from an ETR survey and a new feature they’ve announced. We’ve highlighted in red the salient responses where 600 customers say they’re not slowing hiring because of AI and they’re not reducing headcount. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our most recent AI product survey data suggests that, contrary to popular headlines, AI initiatives are not yet displacing jobs at large scale. Though a handful of organizations have blamed layoffs on new AI-driven productivity gains, the overwhelming majority of survey respondents do not anticipate reducing headcount or slowing hiring because of AI this year. Notably, many organizations are not yet measuring AI’s return on investment in strictly financial terms; instead, they perceive its value in less quantifiable ways — such as improved quality, speed and productivity. Bottom line: We believe that, at least in the near term, AI will not significantly reduce enterprise headcount. Instead, organizations are investing in people who can design, deploy and manage AI systems. Over the longer run, better measurement of ROI and further technological maturity may change the equation, but for 2025, AI appears more poised to create new opportunities than to eliminate jobs. One last added prediction. We’ve been outspoken about Intel and predict it will have no choice but to spin out its foundry business in 2025. Our concern is that Intel’s design business will be acquired in this process, but we most certainly hope not. We believe it’s in the industry’s and country’s best interests for Intel to remain independent. The contributions Intel has made to the technology industry are enormous. Intel was the IBM of its day, an iconic innovator that supported two decades of innovation, the mainspring of which was microprocessor-based computing. For Intel to be subsumed by a firm with a higher market cap or inflated valuations from AI expectations would be a shame. Read our plan to save Intel and maintain its independence, while securing the long-term interests of the United States. We call on the current administration and the spate of tech CEOs who have come out of the woodwork to support President Trump to deeply consider how Intel enabled today’s tech companies to thrive and do your part to help Intel make an Apple-like comeback. What do you think? How do you see 2025 shaping up? What are your predictions for the year? Please let us know.

Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

Title: How A Little Bitcoin Could Have Transformed Your Portfolio

Time Published: 2025-01-25T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Hindsight is 20/20 and if we could go back in time, our portfolios would likely have heaps of Nvidia, Tesla and — you guessed it — Bitcoin. The latter’s meteoric rise has left a number of investors in various states of emotion. Some have been euphoric, while others are regretful thinking back to times when Bitcoin was trading for just a few thousand dollars. Heck, even the sub-$30,000 prices throughout 2023 were a bargain in hindsight. However, that’s the problem with hindsight: Everything seems crystal clear, even when that wasn’t the case at the time. Perhaps in no other endeavor is that more true than when it comes to investing. I remember talking with a wealth manager friend of mine several years ago as they tried to juggle giving advice on Bitcoin at a time where their firm did not offer exposure to cryptoassets. They conceded that while they didn’t necessarily believe in Bitcoin, that small exposure (for instance, 5% or less of their portfolio) could be reasonable for investors who do believe in Bitcoin’s potential. I took a look at what that kind of exposure would mean for an investor’s portfolio, and you know what? A little bit of Bitcoin has gone a long way for those who took the risk. In our example portfolio, we only allocated 5% of its assets to Bitcoin and put the rest in the S&P 500, while the other portfolio was composed of 100% S&P 500 exposure. At the time, some investors felt that even risking something between $100 and $500 on a $10,000 portfolio (a 1% to 5% allocation) was like throwing money away. Looking back though, that “risk” feels so minuscule — now. In our example, a $10,000 portfolio would have grown to more than $65,000 with the Bitcoin allocation vs. a portfolio value of roughly $34,000 under the all-stock approach. In other words, the cumulative return for that portfolio more than doubled vs. the portfolio that was composed of 100% stocks (554% vs. 238%). Don’t get me wrong, turning $10,000 into more than $30,000 in a decade is stellar work, regardless of other what-ifs. However, to see such a massive change in performance due to a small allocation in a risky asset really underscores the long-term compounding effects when that asset turns out to be a huge winner. From a drawdown perspective, the all-stock portfolio suffered a maximum decline of nearly 24% as a result of the 2022 bear market. However, the portfolio with the 5% Bitcoin allocation only suffered a maximum drawdown of 25.6% (which occurred during the same period). And had Bitcoin gone to zero? Well, here’s the fun part. Even with a total loss on a 5% Bitcoin allocation, the portfolio still would have generated a compound annual growth rate of 12.6% — just slightly below the 13% CAGR of the all-stock portfolio. Looking back, those who allocated a small percentage of their portfolio to Bitcoin faced two major risks: The existential risk that Bitcoin declined toward zero and the added volatility of the cryptocurrency as it ebbed and flowed for the past decade. In hindsight, most investors would have gladly accepted what turned out to be less than two percentage points of additional downside risk in exchange for more than 300 additional percentage points on the upside. The added volatility? Well, that would have been harder to stomach. The point here isn’t to make people feel bad about Bitcoin — or really, any other asset or stock that has done exceptionally well over the past five to ten years. Instead, the goal here is to rethink risk — not in a way that attempts to justify an unnecessary gamble, but in a way that results in taking a calculated risk when investors have strong conviction. For every Nvidia or Bitcoin there are dozens or perhaps hundreds of investments that failed to work out. In that context, investors shouldn’t take a shot on everything they see trending on social media. To get that conviction, they need to approach the markets with an open mind and do the research. If after all of that, investors feel strongly about a specific asset or holding, they can approach it with a bite-sized amount of risk. If it completely fails, it won’t cost them all of their hard-earned savings. But if it pans out — like Bitcoin did — it could drastically enhance their long-term returns. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Weird Economic Fear Gives Us A 13% Discount On This Dividend Payer

Middle aged man hugging US dollars with a frightrened facial expression We hear a lot of chatter in the business media about productivity these days—specifically how it could decline in the U.S. (and, by extension, hit our gains from stocks—and stock-focused CEFs). Today we’re going to look at why this fear is overblown, and how we income investors can profit—and collect a 6.7% dividend at a 13% discount—off that disconnect. U.S. productivity, for its part, rises by about 2% on average per year. As we discussed a couple weeks back, the S&P 500 has posted a 10.4% annualized gain since the late 1980s, and we can say that rising productivity accounts for about a fifth of that, so about a 2% gain in stocks on an annualized basis. Before we go further, we should spell out what we mean by productivity. The Bureau of Labor Statistics sees it as a measure of how much more efficient private companies become due to technology improvements, economies of scale, resource allocation, labor, management and infrastructure that influence overall efficiency. Worker Productivity Over the last 40 years, productivity has grown by 0.8% per year. (This number is lower than the 2% rate for public companies because it includes private firms). This rate has stayed steady over this 40-year period, suggesting that American companies aren’t running out of ways to make more with less. Crucially, this has happened while the U.S. population aged at an accelerating rate. Age Dependency Ratio If we look at the age-dependency ratio (a ratio of people older than 64 to the working-age population, defined as people from 15 to 64), we see that it’s risen by 1.1% annualized over the last 40 years. But most of those gains happened in the last 20 years; in the first 20 years, this ratio went up by a mere 0.2% annualized. So if an aging society were a hit to productivity, we would expect the productivity gains to slow down or even reverse in the last 20 years versus the prior 20 years by a big margin, and the data simply doesn’t tell us that. So how much older can America get before demographics become a real concern? One way to think of this is to look at Japan, where the age-dependency ratio is 50, nearly double America’s current rate. In Japan, productivity has flatlined since the late 1980s as a result of that country’s economic bubble bursting. But even as its age-dependency ratio sped up in the 1990s and 2000s, Japan’s productivity didn’t collapse. Japan Age Dependency Of course, the flatline in productivity would mean that the 2% annualized gain for S&P 500 companies we noted as being driven by productivity gains above would vanish, lowering stock returns. So maybe we aren’t out of the woods yet? There’s just one problem with this conclusion: The flatlining in productivity started when Japan’s old-age dependency ratio was two-thirds what it is in America today, at the level the US saw in 1980. So it clearly wasn’t demographics that caused this productivity drop in Japan. And, in fact, if we zoom out, we quickly see the issue: From 1954 to 1990, Japan’s productivity across all sectors grew at an annualized 2% per year, and from 1954 to today it’s grown by 1.0%, still ahead of America’s 0.8% rate. If you know your history, you can see what’s happening here: The after-effects of World War II and the demographics of that period were a lot different from today’s world, which is why extrapolating productivity trends from the ratio of old to young just doesn’t make sense. There are more important factors at play today, like technological gains, business regulation and whether public firms are incentivized to keep passing on their earnings to shareholders. America has outrun both Japan and the rest of the world on all of these factors, as we can see from this chart of the gains in benchmark index funds for the S&P 500 (in purple), global stocks, excluding America (in orange) and Japanese stocks (in blue). US Stocks Outperform Considering this, the current pause in stock-market gains we’ve seen in 2025 so far is a blessing and an opportunity. For those who’ve been out of the market out of fear that the recovery of the last two years is played out, the mostly flat movement of the S&P 500 over the last month allows some time to jump back in. It’s also creating an opportunity to compound this potential in some high-quality stock-focused CEFs like the 6.7%-yielding Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV), whose discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the stocks it holds) has been narrowing, while still remaining attractive, at around 13%: GDV Discount GDV has been oversold for a while, and investors realized this last year and started to bid its discount up from the near-18% level to where it is today. However, the fund remains much cheaper than the average 6.6% discount for all equity CEFs and is focused on high-quality US companies like American Express (AXP), Mastercard (MA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), its fund’s top-three holdings. Plus, because of GDV’s deep discount, the yield on its NAV (as opposed to the discounted market price) comes in at 5.9%. That’s significantly below the 6.7% yield on market price and is much less than the fund’s 7.4% annualized total NAV returns over the last decade.

Title: Ultimate Alexa Command Guide: 200-Plus Voice Commands to Get the Most Out of Your Echo

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Your Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices can do a lot with the right commands for smart home controls, music streaming, daily task automation and more. All these Alexa commands work with the new fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Alexa, Amazon's smart assistant, is capable of doing a lot more than you think. Sure, it can play your favorite New Year's Eve hype song on Spotify or get you the weather forecast for Valentine's Day, but that's just the beginning. You can also use simple voice commands to control your Fire TV devices, set up daily routines and make your smart home even smarter. Want to try something with Alexa? You probably can -- you just need to know the right words to say. If you have an Echo at home and want to get the most out of Alexa, here are all the voice commands you should try. Alexa is set to get an AI overhaul. We saw Amazon demo its new AI-backed commands back in 2023, but the rollout of this big AI update has been pushed. There are several Reddit threads like this one, discussing how the "Let's chat" AI command isn't properly available yet, so all we can do right now is wait it out. Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs. This story is periodically updated.

Title: With 89% ownership in Halma plc (LON:HLMA), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Halma's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Halma plc (LON:HLMA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Last week’s 4.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 34%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Halma, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Halma Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Halma already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Halma's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Halma. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.8% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 3.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Halma plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own UK£7.7m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Halma. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Halma is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about... But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as Greggs plc's (LON:GRG) recent 5.6% drop adds to one-year losses

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Greggs' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock If you want to know who really controls Greggs plc (LON:GRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by UK£126m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 18% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as "smart money", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Greggs, which might have negative implications on individual investors. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Greggs. View our latest analysis for Greggs Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Greggs. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Greggs' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Greggs is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares outstanding. With 5.3% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Fiduciary Management, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Greggs plc in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£2.0m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Greggs. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Greggs better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Greggs is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

January 24, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Jan. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until March 25, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk and certain of Novo Nordisk’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. The Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that “[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial” and that “[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.” On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

Title: Thinking about Getting a Costco Membership? Here's How Much You Can Save

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Costco offers deals on bulk groceries, home essentials and more. But exactly how much can you save? I did the math. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing, and they've seen an annoying uptick since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. In fact, the price of food rose 25% from 2019 to 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- if you have one in your town or city. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which translates to less gas. To see exactly how much money you can save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill over the course of a year. If you're a Costco shopper, make sure you check out how to maximize your Costco savings, and how much you can save with a Costco Executive membership. And for more We Do the Math, check out how much you can save by shopping at Trader Joe's compared to other grocery stores, and if it's cheaper to buy meal kits than groceries.

You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Changyeon Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al. (Case No. 2:25-cv-00713) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. If you suffered a loss in NVO securities, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: How Trump has shifted the narrative around tariffs and sent stocks to new records

Time Published: 2025-01-24T19:58:48Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump flipped the script on one of the market's biggest worries about his presidency this week — his plan to levy steep tariffs on imports— and it's sent stocks climbing to new records as concerns about trade policy fade for the time being. The week's developments represent a considerable shift in the market narrative, as traders have fretted over the potential inflationary impact of Trump's tariff plan for months. In early January, stocks sold off and bond yields spiked on reports that Trump was considering using his emergency powers to bring tariffs early on in his presidency. The message was clear: The market believed tariffs would stoke inflation, which could lead to interest rates staying higher for longer and crush hopes that looser monetary policy would extend the bull market into its third year. But Trump's orders in the first days of his presidency seem to have turned that narrative upside down, with markets getting a major leg-up this week on optimism for economic growth over the next four years. Stocks have climbed steadily higher since Trump's inauguration, when the president promised that tariffs would lead to "massive amounts of money" pouring into the US. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Thursday, recovering from a sell-off at the start of the year as traders digest a slew of orders and policy announcements from the White House. "Now investors are focused on, okay, the executive orders are coming through, he's serious about deregulation, he's serious about getting the tax cuts," Nancy Tengler, the chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Business Insider. "Those are important elements for the market, because — whether you agree with him or not, that's never the issue. The issue is the uncertainty. And so it looks like we're going to have a regular order of business and things are going to chug along," she added. The bond market also appears to have recovered some of its losses. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury crept up slightly this week but is down about 20 basis points from its peak earlier in the month. The yield was hovering around 4.6% Friday after approaching 5% a few weeks ago, a level that has historically been a threshold for a sell-off in stocks when crossed. Investor sentiment, meanwhile, is up sharply. According to the AAII's latest Investor Sentiment Survey, 43% of investors said they were bullish on stocks over the next six months, up from 25% who felt that way the prior week. "People look excited about what appears to be a real pro-growth agenda," Paul Stanley, the chief investment officer of Granite Bay Wealth Management told BI in an interview, adding that investors likely have put their worries for inflation on hold. "On the whole, the market is telling us that they believe his policies are likely to be better for growth than they're negative on the other end." In other words, the president's flurry of executive actions this week helped steer the market's attention toward higher growth and away from potential threats of a still-uncertain trade policy. Trump signed an executive order declaring a "national energy emergency," lowering guardrails to increase fracking and oil production in the US. He announced a $500 billion deal between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build more AI infrastructure, an initiative he said would create more than 100,000 jobs in the US. That announcement sparked a pronounced move up among the market's top AI tech stocks midweek. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said he would demand that "interest rates drop immediately" and ask Saudi Arabia to help bring down oil prices. On Thursday, he signed an executive order related to crypto, reviving bullishness. While the order was light on big developments related to some of the most bullish ideas floating around the crypto sphere—like the establishment of a national bitcoin stockpile—industry insiders say they feel it is a step in the right direction toward more robust government support for digital assets.

Amazon’s decision to shut down seven distribution centres in Quebec, affecting over 1,900 jobs, has sparked sharp criticism from Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne. In a strongly worded letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Champagne expressed disappointment over the closures and urged the company to reconsider, shared the minister on Thursday evening on X. “When Amazon entered the Canadian market, it did so recognizing the value of Canada’s exceptional workers,” Champagne wrote. He pointed out the closures undermine Amazon’s commitment to being “Earth’s best employer” and called the decision inconsistent with the company’s values. The closures come after Amazon’s Laval distribution centre became the first in North America to unionize, raising speculation that decision could be linked to its resistance to unionized labour. Champagne argued that Amazon’s Quebec facilities play a vital role in the company’s supply chain, ensuring quick delivery across the province and contributing significantly to the local economy. He added that the layoffs would have ripple effects on communities, highlighting the importance of Amazon’s business partnership with Canada. “It is not too late to reconsider your decision,” Champagne urged, adding that such layoffs raise concerns about Amazon’s long-term commitment to the Canadian market. The letter called for a review of Amazon’s relationship with the Canadian government and extended an invitation to discuss the matter further. With Parliament currently prorogued by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and a spring federal election looming, Champagne’s words don’t mean much. But at least it makes his constituents feel better. In an emailed statement to iPhone in Canada on Wednesday, Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said, “Following a recent review of our Quebec operations, we’ve seen that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to what we had until 2020, will allow us to provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run.” She added, “This decision wasn’t made lightly, and we’re offering impacted employees a package that includes up to 14 weeks’ pay after facilities close and transitional benefits, like job placement resources.” In a nutshell, Laval workers unionized and Amazon appealed to the labour board, citing the vote didn’t recognize worker rights, since the vote was not by secret ballot, but rather by signing cards. Amazon lost the appeal–and now they have pulled out of Quebec.

Saturday, 25 Jan 2025 OTTAWA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is threatening to review its commercial relationship with Amazon after the online retail giant decided to close all its distribution centers in Quebec, local media reported Friday. Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne, expressing his strong disappointment, demanded that Amazon "immediately" reconsider the decision, according to the report. Amazon said that it would cease operations in the French-speaking province over the next two months, turning back to the third-party model it had until 2020 for package deliveries. As such, at least 1,700 regular employees in Quebec and 250 temporary-seasonal workers would lose their jobs, said the report. "This is not the way business is done in Canada," said Champagne on his social media account, stating that the "large and sudden layoffs are cause for concern." Amazon denied that the decision was made following the unionization of 200 employees last spring at one of the warehouses, according to the report. Thank you for your report!

Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: Stripe ruffles feathers as accidental ‘cartoon duck’ sent to laid-off staffers

Full Content:
An image accidentally sent to laid-off Stripe staffers shows their communications team might have just been winging it. The payment processing platform accidentally sent an image of a cartoon duck in emails to employees notifying them of their termination, The Post has learned. On Monday, Stripe – whose customers include Amazon, Alaska Airlines, Blockchain.com and Slack – announced it was laying off 300 employees, or approximately 3.5% of its workforce. The impacted staffers are mostly in product, engineering and operations roles, according to a leaked memo. These workers received emails with an attached image labeled “US-Non-California Duck” showing a fluffy yellow cartoon bird. Employees took to Blind, an anonymous site where corporate employees can share grievances, to make light of the duck-up. “Never liked it when someone put a duck on my Jeep…this would have sent me over the edge,” one Blind user registered as a Stripe employee wrote. A Stripe spokesperson confirmed that the duck images were accidentally sent to laid-off staffers, and that impacted employees received notices with the incorrect termination dates, as well. Business Insider earlier reported news of the leaked emails. “I apologize for the error and any confusion it caused,” Rob McIntosh, Stripe’s chief people officer, said in an email to employees. “Corrected and full notifications have since been sent to all impacted Stripes.” In a separate email, McIntosh told Stripe staffers that the company is still hoping to grow its workforce by 17% to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The tech startup, which launched in 2011, has suffered layoffs in the past. Stripe is a privately-held company, so most of its financials are not disclosed, but it was likely hit hard in 2022, when it laid off more than 1,000 staffers. At the time, CEO Patrick Collison blamed the economy and fears of a recession in a public letter – an explanation that won praise for its frankness. Stripe also cut its valuation multiple times over the years, though it recently jumped back up to around $70 billion in November, according to Bloomberg. The valuation puts Stripe in the same ranks as wealthy startups like SpaceX and OpenAI, though it’s still below its 2021 peak of $95 billion. Stripe is the second-largest startup in the Bay Area, behind only OpenAI, according to SFGate. Advertisement

Title: Novo Nordisk stock surges 12% as an Ozempic alternative shows promising weight loss
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-amycretin-trial-weight-loss-drugs-1851746953
Time Published: 2025-01-24T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO-0.36%) stock jumped 12% in pre-market trading Friday after it released promising results of an early-stage weight loss drug trial. The Danish pharmaceutical giant announced Friday that a small clinical trial found that 20 milligram once-weekly injections of its amycretin obesity drug helped obese and overweight patients lose 22% of their body weight in 36 weeks. “We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo. “The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.” Amycretin is what’s known as a “unimolecular long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist.” Essentially, it’s a combination of two hormones that regulate appetite and blood sugar levels. Popular GLP-1 agonists include Novo Nordisk’s own Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.04%) Zepbound and Mounjaro. Based on the latest results, Novo Nordisk said it’s now planning further clinical development of amycretin for obese and overweight adults. Findings from a small phase 1 clinical trial of oral amycretin last September suggested that the pill could lead to more and faster weight loss than popular weekly injection Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a larger clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s popular weight-loss drug Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It’s worth noting, however, that larger phase II, III, and IV trials, involving thousands more participants, could return different results. — Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: After XRP Made New ATH at $3.4, Traders are Expecting Solana to Hit New Highs While DTX Leads Growth

For the first time in seven years, Ripple (XRP) made an impressive rally to a new high price of $3.4. This surge has reignited bullish sentiment in the crypto community. Now, savvy investors believe more gains could occur as rumors of a broader crypto adoption are underway. Also, Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a top blockchain, showcasing steady growth over the past year. As more developments await this platform, traders expect that Solana will also hit new highs. Additionally, this new player, DTX Exchange (DTX), is gaining traction with its hybrid platform, as it aims to deliver unparalleled speed, security, and liquidity for traders. It leads many to speculate if DTX’s launch in Q1 2025 could position it ahead of Solana and XRP. The stage is indeed set for a thrilling showdown. This article shares more details about these assets. Ripple (XRP) Surges to $3.40 The XRP price’s rally to a recent high of $3.40 is fueled by a mix of exciting developments and bullish fundamentals. A game-changing report revealed Donald Trump’s openness to an America-first crypto reserve, spotlighting US-founded tokens like XRP, Solana, and USDC. This potential initiative has sparked investor optimism, setting the stage for increased adoption of these assets. Behind the scenes, crypto whales have been accumulating XRP, purchasing a staggering 1.43 billion tokens over two months — a move often signaling price discovery. This momentum has been bolstered by a 10% surge in trading volume, with $11 billion traded in just 24 hours. Adding fuel to the fire, the SEC’s appeal against Ripple unexpectedly boosted confidence, as the Commission didn’t dispute the court’s ruling that XRP isn’t a security. With bullish forecasts pointing to a breakout between $8 and $13, XRP’s rally may just be getting started. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Eyes on $300 as ETFs Spark Bullish Momentum Solana is making waves with a 20% intraday surge, currently trading above $230, despite a 30% dip earlier in January. Dominating the decentralized exchange (DEX) space with a 30% market share and $220+ billion in Q4 2024 trade volume, Solana remains a blockchain powerhouse. The buzz around SOL ETFs is also driving optimism, as top financial firms like Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise have filed applications with the SEC. With rulings expected between January 23 and 25, 2025, experts predict these ETFs could attract $3–6 billion in net assets within their first year. Technically, bullish patterns like strong support levels at $200 and $220 signal potential upside. While trading below the 50-day moving average, SOL shows bullish dominance, with green candles reinforcing upward momentum. DTX Exchange (DTX): Revolutionizing the Trading Landscape DTX Exchange is a groundbreaking platform designed to reshape both traditional and crypto trading by creating a seamless, inclusive environment for investors worldwide. At its core, DTX Exchange merges the best of centralized and decentralized models into the world’s first hybrid exchange.

With speeds exceeding 200,000 transactions per second and advanced selective transparency, VulcanX guarantees seamless transactions — even during high network congestion. The DTX token fuels the ecosystem, granting users discounted trading fees, premium analytics, loyalty rewards, and exclusive access to tokenized assets. The token’s presale success has been outstanding so far, with over $12 million raised. Interestingly, early investors have reaped 600% returns already. As the token price surges from $0.14 to its $0.20 launch price, new investors can still capitalize on a 40% gain before the presale ends. Analysts predict DTX could dominate 2025, riding the next bull run to unmatched heights. DTX Exchange (DTX) Could Lead the Charge in Q1 2025 As Ripple and Solana approach newer highs, DTX Exchange gains traction with its groundbreaking hybrid trading platform set to revolutionize the market in Q1 2025. Given its innovative utility, DTX offers unmatched speed, cutting-edge security, and a unified interface for managing diverse assets.

Title: Trump has a message to CEOs: Build in America or pay up
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-message-ceos-davos-america-business-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T13:45:20Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump is making sure the whole world knows it: "America is back and open for business." Trump appeared via videolink to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where he addressed some of the world's most powerful leaders. BI's Spriha Srivastava was in the room to witness the audience go from laughter to silence in seconds. "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America," Trump said. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff," he added. Trump has previously threatened to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he said could begin as early as February 1. He also proposed a 60% tariff on China during his presidential campaign, but he said earlier this week he was considering a 10% tariff on goods from the country next month. When Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman asked about Europe, Trump didn't hold back, voicing his frustration with European regulatory enforcement actions against tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta (who were major donors to his inauguration and whose CEOs were prominent guests). "Whether you like them or not, they're American companies, and they shouldn't be doing that," Trump said. Trump has plans for the corporate tax rate. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO, asked how the Trump administration would prioritize GDP growth and reducing inflation amid his dozens of executive orders. Trump said he would work to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% from 21%, provided companies manufacture their products in the US. The president also called out big banks, accusing them of discriminating against conservatives. "Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America," he said. Bank of America responded publicly, saying it welcomes conservatives among its 70 million clients. The president also thanked Saudi Arabia after it announced it would invest $600 billion in the US, but Trump added that he would be asking the crown prince "who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion." When Trump finished, Schwarzman remarked: "I'm sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today." Trump's speech reminded Spriha of how different his style is from the measured, diplomatic tone that usually defines Davos. Whether his message landed the way he intended, however, is another question. BI's Katie Balevic, Dominick Reuter, Noah Sheidlower, and Allie Kelly have the full rundown of Trump's address.

Title: Signal: Surging Netflix Stock Could Hit Four Digits, And Soon
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/24/signal-surging-netflix-stock-could-hit-four-digits-and-soon/

Netflix (NFLX) was a big winner on Wall Street this week. The streaming stock gapped 9.7% higher on Jan. 22, in the wake of an outstanding earnings report that saw the company post a top-line beat for the fourth quarter and topple 300 million subscribers. The shares hit a record high of $999 that day, before cooling off and settling at $953.99. The good news for investors betting on NFLX hitting four digits – the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. Netflix’s recent high coincides with historically low implied volatility (IV) – a combination that has generated tailwinds in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight times over the last five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) also happened to sit in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is the case with the stock’s current SVI of 25%, which sits in the 6th percentile of its annual range. Netflix stock chart with 80-day moving average Data shows that one month after those signals, the equity boasted a 75% win rate and averaged a 4.7% return over that timeframe. From its current perch of $979.92, a similar move would put NFLX comfortably above $1,000 in the next month. There are additional technical support levels to watch that could make this rally sustainable. Note in the chart above the channel of higher highs carved since August. If the stock can topple the upper rail of this channel, NFLX could be off to the races. The equity could also see chart support step up at its newly-cleared +10% year-to-date level, while its 80-day moving average was an effective springboard earlier this month, also per the chart above. Analysts have been slow to adjust, and bull notes could also keep the wind at the security’s back. There are still 16 brokerages of the 41 in coverage that are on the sidelines with “hold” or “strong sell” ratings, while NFLX’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,047.20 is only a 6.6% premium from its current perch.

Title: Want a Job In AI & Healthcare Tech? Here Are 5 Growth Areas Actively Hiring Right Now

There is significant demand for individuals interested in artificial intelligence and digital ... [+] transformation. There are widely mixed opinions on the state of the current job market. Most industry leaders signal that economic conditions seem to be healthy and the state of the market is incredibly robust. In fact, the latest report indicates that the U.S. economy added nearly 256,000 positions in December. However, many individuals are equally frustrated with the lack of opportunities and are experiencing a relatively stagnant labor market, especially with the numerous layoffs that have occurred in the last year. Some sectors have been more proactive than others, especially with regards to investing heavily in the new wave of AI innovation and digital transformation, which has resulted in increased demand for talent and skilled workers. Healthcare is one such field and has especially embraced AI as a means to reduce administrative burdens and improve workflows in the field. Indeed, 2025 will be a monumental year for this work. Individuals that are interested in healthcare technology and AI may have opportunities in the following 5 growth areas that are actively ramping up spending and hiring: 1. Work surrounding AI agents: 2025 is purported to be the year of AI agents in healthcare, which may be used for a variety of roles including responding to customer service inquiries, assisting with routine paperwork or even streamlining common and protocolized tasks. In fact, founder and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang mentioned at the CES conference earlier this month that IT departments will soon “become the HR of AI agents,” given how widespread and prevalent they will become. 2. Cloud engineering and architecture: many of the largest AI platforms including those by Google, Amazon and Microsoft are hosted and provided through their respective cloud services. For example, Google’s Vertex AI Search is a widely successful product which streamlines search within healthcare organizations and enables rapid insight generation for providers. Healthcare organizations can access this platform through Google Cloud. AWS and Microsoft Azure offer similar services. Thus, cloud applications have become incredibly critical in the AI arena and will undoubtedly require a lot of talent. 3. Digital twins technology: this is another growing area which enables organizations to create virtual models to run simulations and alter paradigms to better inform decision-making. Digital twin platforms can entail technical models such as a human heart model or a protein molecule to aid in drug development, or larger datasets across an entire population or community to inform macroscopic decisions. Digital twins have immense potential in healthcare as the technology can be used to resolve critical situations with high fidelity representations. Dr. Natalia Trayanova leads some of this work at Johns Hopkins University and uses the technology to support personalized healthcare in the field of cardiology: “digital twinning technology promises to deliver a digital representation of organs or even patients by using tools capable of simulating personal health conditions and predicting patient or disease trajectories on the basis of relationships learned both from data and from biophysics knowledge. Such virtual replicas would update themselves with data from monitoring devices and medical tests and assessments, reflecting dynamically the changes in our health conditions and the responses to treatment.” 4. Health devices: this area is projected to have a blockbuster decade as there has been an increased focus by the general population on collecting more health metrics and insights. For example, Google’s FitBit is one of the most popular devices in the world of personalized hardware and provides users with information on their daily energy expenditure and fitness goals. Another great example is the Oura ring, which has been incredibly popular in the last few years as a sleep tracking device; the company just recently hit $5 billion in valuation. There is a huge demand for both software experts and hardware engineers in this line of work. 5. Technology strategy: these roles will be a key aspect of healthcare organization portfolios in the coming years. Despite all the technical work, organizations must ultimately devise a strategy and justify their investments in artificial intelligence and digital health. This is where senior strategists and those familiar with enterprise optimization can come in handy, especially as many organizations are struggling to still define and realize the true ROI for healthcare AI applications. These leaders will be paramount to understand the technology landscape, develop accurate forecasts and determine the future course for organizations. Undoubtedly, those interested in technology will have to remain nimble and willing to up-skill themselves accordingly. Despite a rapidly changing job landscape, the swift growth of technology and AI, especially as they pertain to healthcare, offer numerous potential opportunities for determined job seekers to take advantage of.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software.

Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

The trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and proof-of-concept after once-weekly subcutaneous administrations of amycretin in 125 people with overweight or obesity. The trial was a combined single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose and dose-response trial investigating three different maintenance doses with a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was treatment emergent adverse events. The safety profile of amycretin was consistent with incretin-based therapies. The most common adverse events with amycretin were gastrointestinal and the vast majority were mild to moderate in severity. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline body weight of 92.7 kg, people treated with amycretin achieved an estimated body weight loss of 9.7% on 1.25mg (20 weeks), 16.2% on 5mg (28 weeks) and 22.0% on 20mg (36 weeks). People treated with placebo experienced an estimated 1.9%, 2.3% and 2.0% body weight gain, respectively. “We are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,” said Martin Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “The results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk is now planning further clinical development of amycretin in adults with overweight or obesity.

Title: Netflix Africa Hires Scripted Content Chief As Tendeka Matatu Exits

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Africa content team has reshuffled with ex-Amazon exec Kaye-Ann Williams brought in to oversee TV and movies as Tendeka Matatu exits. Williams takes on the newly-created Director of Scripted Content role and will focus on local productions, overseeing a team that develops and creates African original films and series. She joins after a short stint as content boss at The Traitors South Africa producer Primedia Studios and is a former Head of Scripted Series and Movies at Prime Video/Amazon Studios, where she focused on South Africa. Commencing her role next month, Williams will report to Ben Amadasun, Netflix’s Vice President of Middle East & Africa Content. Watch on Deadline Related Stories News 'The Night Agent' Tops Netflix TV List With Season 2 Debut; 'Back In Action' Sets Sights On Most Popular Film List News UK Government Has "No Plans" For Streamer Levy Amid Scripted Funding Crisis Williams will join shortly after the exit of Matatu, who was Director of Local Language Films, Africa, for the past three years. No word on Matatu’s next move but we are told he is pursuing other opportunities. His credits included Heart of the Hunter and Kandasamys: The Baby. Amadasun credited Williams with helping creative talent “create some of the most ambitious projects on African television.” “I’m delighted to welcome Kaye-Ann to the team as we strengthen our long-term commitment to African storytelling,” he added. “I look forward to working alongside her to further build on the wonderful work the team has done so far to deliver compelling stories from Africa and to nurture our many local creative partnerships.” Amazon cut funding in Africa and made layoffs last year and sources from the local sector had recently questioned whether Netflix was heading in the same direction, with rumors of shows being pulled. Netflix pushed back, noting that it is “strengthening its investment in African storytelling” and pointing to Williams’ stellar credentials. Since kickstarting local African commissioning with 2020’s Queen Sono, Netflix cited significant deals struck with the likes of Silverton Siege’s Mandla Dube and Jayan Moodley, creator of the Kandasamys franchise. At the recent MIP Africa in Cape Town, Amadasun unveiled a trio of new movies along with a Blood Legacy series from Blood & Water producer Gambit Films and reality show Love Never Lies: South Africa. The news comes off the back of a strong week for Netflix. The streaming powerhouse smashed estimates by adding nearly 19 million subscribers in Q4 – the final quarter for which it will report these numbers.

On a pleasant January morning in Bengaluru, known globally as the Silicon Valley of India, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti opened a new consulate, the fifth in the South Asian nation. In three days, the Joe Biden appointee would step down, paving the way for the Trump 2.0 administration to choose his replacement. Speaking at the event, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called it a “new milestone” in bilateral relations, particularly in sectors like technology, space, defense, and education. “As we enter an era of AI, EVs, drones, biotechnology, and advanced space exploration, our partnership will increasingly be defined by innovation. Bengaluru, as India’s tech capital, and [the state of] Karnataka, as a hub of innovation, will play crucial roles in this journey,” Jaishankar said. Three days later, on January 20, he would be attending the swearing-in ceremony of US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. Later, he would engage the newly appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the issue of “irregular immigration” and visa policy regarding the millions of Indian professionals in the US. On that January day, around 8,000 miles away, in a Boston suburb, N. Ranganathan, a 36-year-old software techie working as a software analyst, was visibly upset with a leading aircraft manufacturer. He, his wife and their three-year-old son were in for a hard realization about the US being “a land of dreams.” “I have been in this country for the last seven years and with my son having been born here, I was hoping that my son gets naturalized citizenship. With the latest ruling by the president, I am not sure whether I and my family want to be [here], as we feel disrespected about the fact that despite paying taxes as well as contributing to the US economy, we are treated like ‘boat people’ (refugees).” Like Ranganathan, millions of Indians face the dilemma of whether to continue working in the US or seek alternative options. US President Donald Trump began his term in office with sweeping executive orders, including one ending birthright citizenship for children whose parents are neither American citizens nor permanent residents. This could affect over a million Indians waiting for green cards – with some of them locked in a bureaucratic backlog for a decade. However, broader concern over Trump’s visa policies during his second term is something that is being discussed both among the diaspora in the US and back in Bengaluru and other Indian tech hubs. India’s $250 billion IT outsourcing industry is at a critical juncture – and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the biggest challenge. In December, social media was boiling after billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Their statements sparked an online spat between anti-immigration Trump loyalists and the tech-oriented conservative faction. The US tech industry, which is facing layoffs, relies on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of IT professionals – mainly from India (over 72%), as well as China and other nations. Supporters claim that H-1B workers address essential skill shortages and foster innovation, while opponents argue that the program keeps wages low and displaces US employees. Musk, who himself is a South African immigrant who once held an H-1B visa, said he was in favor of bringing “the top ~0.1% of engineering talent” via a legal route as it is “essential for America to keep winning.” He also told critics to “go f*** yourself in the face,” referring to them as “subtards.” Musk has long argued for increased immigration and greater opportunities for skilled workers to live and work in the US, often pointing out that the country’s long-term success depends on attracting the best and brightest talent globally. The online standoff came days after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule aimed at ‘reforming’ the H-1B program to help American companies address critical workforce shortages. The new rule looks to simplify the approval process, enhancing flexibility for employers to retain skilled workers, and strengthen the program’s oversight and integrity. Additionally, on December 27th, the US Department of State announced the completion of a successful pilot program to let people renew H-1B visas without having to leave the country. This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, the Department of State said, promising to establish a US-based renewal program in 2025. At around the same time, President Trump announced the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born venture capitalist, to lead artificial intelligence policy. In the past, Krishnan had supported the removal of country caps on green cards for skilled immigrants in the US. This was too much for some MAGA supporters, who feel that this visa system needs to be scrapped as it doesn’t add any value to the US economy and instead takes away the jobs of people who have similar qualifications. In some cases, American workers who were laid off were forced to train their H-1B counterparts. If they failed to do so, they risked losing their severance pay. Federal lawsuits were filed by two of the tech workers laid off from the Walt Disney Co. One of them even testified before a Senate Committee. The war of words on H-1B was not limited to social media. There have been racist attacks against Indians on the TV and in real life. Fox News carried an interview with a commentator who openly referred to Indians as “third world parasites.” Immediately after the online fracas between Musk and other MAGA supporters, Trump came to Elon’s defense. In an interview with the New York Post, he praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the US. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. Speaking at a press conference at the White House after taking office, Trump said “I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country, even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have the qualifications they do,” he said while addressing a joint press conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. “We have to have quality people coming in. Now by doing that, we’re expanding businesses and that takes care of everybody. So I’m sort of on both sides of the argument, but what I really do feel is that we have to let really competent people, great people, come into our country. And we do that through the H-1B program,” he added. This marked a U-turn on H-1B visas for Trump; in 2016 he called them "very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, he imposed a temporary ban on the visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. The question for those whose lives and profits revolve around H-1B visas remains open – how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech? The H-1B visa program, which started in 1990, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that typically require a high level of technical expertise (fields such as IT, engineering, and healthcare). The visa is initially granted for three years, and can be extended by another three years. Every year, 85,000 such visas are up for grabs, through a lottery system. Major tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Qualcomm Technologies, Ernst and Young, as well as outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, HCL America and others heavily rely on H-1B visas. Indian companies, who swarmed the US in large numbers at the height of the dotcom boom-in the 1990s are the biggest beneficiaries of H-1B visas.In May 2024, according to US State Department data from 2022, as much as 77% of 320,000 H-1B visa applications went to Indians. Indian companies are taking measures to counter any negative pushback with regard to H-1B visas, by hiring locals. For India’s second-largest information technology company Infosys, over 60% of the workforce in the US now comprises locals, Infosys’ Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka told media recently. TCS CEO Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that a decrease in H-1B visas can be offset by other strategies, such as relocating work to India, reducing the overall reliance on H-1B. From the first time Trump took charge in 2016, the US authorities have clamped down on frauds related to applications from H-1B, increased the cost of filings [upwards of $8,000] and even limited repeated filings, in an effort to make the system fair. As a result, people can no longer submit multiple applications to increase their chances of winning the lottery, as this creates an unfair advantage. The crackdown on frauds seemed to have worked to some extent. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] revealed that the number of entries for the year’s lottery stood at 470,342, marking a substantial 38% decline from the 758,994 entries received in 2023, according to a report by the Associated Press. Since December, both Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, seem to have offered their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the program needs a fix. “Easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically. I’ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,” Musk said days after telling critics to “go f*** yourself.” Immigrant attorneys believe that unlike the past, this time things may actually change. “The system is broken and it needs to be fixed, especially around the area of what is considered to be a job/service that cannot be done by a local and requires a special visa,” an attorney from a Washington-based law firm told RT. Meanwhile, India has used diplomatic language to advocate for favorable visa policies while emphasizing mutual benefits and India’s indispensable role in the partnership. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in early January, breaking his silence on the H-1B debate. Industry watchers believe that H-1B visas can still address the basic issues which led to its creation in the first place, i.e. supplying engineers to met tech’s gargantuan demands. “The H-1B program, which is based on numerical limits set over 30 years ago, still remains terribly short of meeting the needs of the US economy in the global competition for talent, particularly in STEM fields,” believes Ashank Desai, Principal Founder and former Chairman of Mastek as well as founding member of Indian software lobby firm NASSCOM. Ganesh Natarajan, Executive Chairman and Founder of 5F World, and formerly CEO of Zensar, a Pune-based outsourcing firm, told RT the H-1B mindset needs to change “from wage arbitrage to quality of talent. In many ways, it needs to evolve.” Ultimately, the next move of the Trump administration will significantly impact India’s exports. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India’s total exports reached $776.68 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. Software exports alone account for about 4% of the country’s GDP and generate approximately 5.4 million direct jobs and nearly 20 million indirect jobs. Therefore, any changes to visa policies are likely to affect India’s export landscape.
