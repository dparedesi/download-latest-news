Hello, I’ll start today with the case of the “Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,” with some observations and a bit of reporting. First of all, let’s clarify that according to my source from the Ministry of Defense, Dendias was aware of Mitsotakis’ decision—to assign the guarding of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to the Ministry of Defense—since last Thursday, when the Prime Minister himself called him. Mitsotakis’ post, I remind you, came three days later, on Sunday morning, on his Facebook page. I asked insistently whether Dendias expressed any objections to this, and my source answered negatively—and, frankly, no one would expect Dendias, with his profile as a serious and reasonable right-wing politician, to react otherwise. I’m told that the amendment stipulating that anyone desecrating the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier will face arrest and up to two years in prison will most likely be submitted on Monday by Mitsotakis himself, who will also elaborate on the issue. Spokesman Marinakis clarified yesterday that they’re not going to erase the names of the dead from the monument, but that “the tent is over.” And I think that’s the right handling—to avoid giving the usual suspects an excuse to stir up tension. Now let’s turn to PASOK’s reaction yesterday. I systematically avoid commenting on Ms. Karystianou for obvious reasons. But PASOK’s announcement highlighted the party’s major identity crisis. In simple terms, leader Nikos has lost his bearings—even on an issue as relatively straightforward as this one for a rational, centrist party like PASOK has been since 1985. You can’t be both for the policeman and against him, as the old saying goes, because in the end you look ridiculous. And of course, no centrist voter is “for the tent.” With all this going on, PASOK is heading for third place. As we wrote recently, Tsipras’ people claim that polls show them trending toward second place, ahead of PASOK. A reliable source of mine confirmed that Tsipras is now polling at a solid 8% (“yes, I’ll vote for him”), with another 4–5% in focus groups saying they’re “very close to voting for him.” So, he’s taking about two-thirds of SYRIZA, all of New Left, and nibbling votes across the left spectrum—plus about one point from Nikos. That adds up to around 12.5% for Tσίπρας, while PASOK sits at 12% in the same survey. We’ll see in the coming months whether this holds up—but if PASOK keeps “pretending to be Zoi (Konstantopoulou), just more polished,” as some say, they’re definitely heading for bronze. Today’s parliamentary session will focus heavily on national issues, as part of the pre-agenda debate. I understand that Mitsotakis, who’s generally irritated by the domestic criticism his government faces and by the breakdown of institutional unity, has decided to strike a sharp tone in both his speech and his closing remarks. Yesterday’s meeting between Minister Tsiaras and ND MPs at party headquarters was a known “minefield,” and the discussion was far from easy. Still, it could have been worse if not for two small pressure-release valves: first, payments that went through yesterday along with some relief measures for affected producers; second, Tsiaras’ honesty—he described the tough situation and read letters the ministry received from the European Commission. Despite good intentions, ND MPs are furious—both over the handling of the livestock epidemic and the mess with farm subsidies. Some doubt whether OPEKEPE should move under the tax authority (AADE), arguing that the agency also certifies, not just pays out funds. Others say precious time was lost and the issue underestimated, though they’ve now been promised that advance payments for the basic subsidy will be completed by the end of November. Everyone, however, recognizes that in a social group that once gave ND nearly 50%, the mood has turned sour. Of course, they all knew what was going on—but now that things have tightened, they’re speaking up, worried about reelection. On Friday, Mitsotakis plans a visit to Peristeri. He’s expected to inaugurate the city’s new courthouse with ministers Floridis and Bougas, alongside a blessing ceremony by local Bishop Grigorios. The area is his old constituency, so it’s familiar territory. In general, he’ll be resuming his public rounds. And while we’re on the Prime Minister’s schedule: the Onassis Foundation has completed the new National Transplant Center and the renovation of the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center. On Tuesday, October 21, Mitsotakis will inaugurate this major donation. The new National Transplant Center is state-of-the-art—built at a cost of €100 million, with cutting-edge medical technology worth over €30 million. The 7,000-sq-meter, four-story facility has 47 new beds (33 for children) and 12 pediatric ICU beds (5 for infants). Samaras made his first public appearance in a while yesterday, at Karamanlis’ speech in the Old Parliament building. A week earlier, he’d avoided a face-to-face meeting with Mitsotakis—who, though invited, carefully stayed away. Instead, Hatzidakis had to drink the “bitter cup,” finding himself suddenly seated next to Samaras (though that chair had been empty at first). I’m told Samaras now plans to appear regularly at public events—from now on, expect to see more of him, with all that implies. Yesterday at the Hotel Grande Bretagne took place the second Olympia Dialogues event. After banker Josef Ackermann headlined the first one, this time Panos Germanos and Andreas Athanasopoulos hosted Dr. Sadek Wahba, founder of the private equity firm I Squared Capital. Based in Miami, with about $60 billion under management, I Squared Capital invests broadly in infrastructure — from water, ports, and logistics to data centers, batteries, and transport. Wahba, who already has connections in Greece and sees the country as a major investment opportunity, even owns companies operating London’s red double-decker buses. Among the high-profile Greek business figures attending were D. Papalexopoulos, Eutychis Vassilakis, Nikos Karamouzis, G. Linatsas (AXIA), Stelios Frangos (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund investment fund), Aris Karytinos (Prodea), K. Kazas (Grant Thornton), Rania Aikaterinari (SEV), Giannis Emiris (Alpha Bank), H. Lampropoulos (Hellenic Development Bank of Investments), N. Vettas (IOBE), G. Michos, and others. There is deep concern in the insurance sector about the future and the impending transformations in the market. The aggressive entry of banks into the insurance business has alarmed insurers who are being left out, fearing that this will exert heavy pressure on the industry, create new, unpredictable dynamics, and limit access to premium-generation “channels.” Their worries are far from unfounded. The famous Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab—at 750 15th Street NW in Washington, D.C., right across from the White House—is one of America’s best-known restaurants. With several private rooms, it’s a discreet meeting spot for politicians, business leaders, and analysts. During the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings, Joe’s Steakhouse becomes the traditional meeting place for the Greek delegation, where it holds key talks away from prying eyes. Michalis Masourakis has already handled the necessary reservations, and Greece is, in fact, a popular discussion topic this year. Between plates of Florida stone crab claws, prime steaks, and the famous lemon pie, major deals are often sealed. Just days ago, Argentine President Javier Milei celebrated there after securing a $20 billion aid deal for Argentina, even inviting the Chinese to buy soy from Argentina instead of the U.S. The Greek team arrived Tuesday afternoon and began meetings all day Wednesday, starting with JP Morgan and Oliver Wyman. Guido Emanuele Grimaldi, chairman of the Igoumenitsa Port Authority, appears to have big plans for the wider region, aiming to attract more Italian tourists to Greece. Speaking informally during the Shortsea Shipping Owners Association Conference in Athens (“Walking into a New Era”), he revealed that he’s focusing especially on Syvota and Plataria, areas in a strategic location—close to Paxos and just 48 miles from Italy. “Syvota is a beautiful area, but not well-known in Italy,” he admitted. “Only the region of Apulia really knows it—elsewhere, Italians discover it mainly through sailing.” Since the area is just a few hours away by sea, Grimaldi believes Western Greece is highly appealing for Italian travelers. This initiative is part of a broader tourism development plan to boost visitor numbers and strengthen the local economy of Igoumenitsa. The long-anticipated discussion at the 2nd Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee began on Tuesday in London, focusing on the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which aims to establish new decarbonization measures for global shipping. The framework is expected to be put to a vote today, Thursday, October 16, 2025 — unless postponed to tomorrow. This is perhaps the only instance where the United States and Russia stand publicly side by side, joined by Saudi Arabia, all strongly opposing the adoption of these new environmental rules. Many countries initially kept their positions secret, while Saudi Arabia, on the very first day, even requested that the working group not begin — a request that was denied. Participants have been redrafting several parts of the text, which, according to one source “present on the ground,” were almost nonsensical in their original form. The lobbying has been intense: one country’s delegate initially announced they would support the measures, only to reverse course a few hours later after strong backlash from domestic shipowners. The electoral General Assembly of the Cyprus Union of Shipowners (CUS) took place on Monday, October 6, 2025, marking a new chapter for Cypriot shipping. Polys V. HadjiIoannou was elected as president, and the new board includes several prominent Greek shipowners: Thanasis Martinos, Ioannis Coustas, Haris Vafias, Ioanna Procopiou, and George Tsavliris. The OPAP stock showed a stabilizing trend in yesterday’s trading session. It remained mostly positive throughout the day, dipping slightly during the auctions to close at €18.60. The stock has now entered a new phase, characterized by high trading volumes — €26.8 million on Monday, €77 million on Tuesday, and €22.6 million yesterday — on par with the activity seen in the major banks. Brokers noted that OPAP will attract portfolios seeking both growth and dividend yield, as management has pledged a minimum payout of €1 per share. The possibility of future acquisitions remains on the table, as emphasized during the company’s analyst call. In the coming months, OPAP and its parent company Allwyn will be in the spotlight as analysts and institutional investors are briefed on the ambitious merger that aims to create a €16 billion integrated gaming and lottery giant, headquartered in Athens, with a strong presence in both Europe and the U.S.. Such scale, especially for a company based in Greece, is truly unprecedented. Greek retail investors continue to pour about €100 million weekly into mutual funds, which now total €28.3 billion in assets. Company earnings have been solid but unspectacular, while a wave of major deals shows that listed firms are preparing for the next era of capital markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve, meeting on October 27–28, is expected to cut interest rates by another 0.25%, citing weak labor market data rather than inflation. Meanwhile, Christine Lagarde, mindful of Paris and Berlin, is also hinting at a possible Eurozone rate cut. In this mixed environment — neither bearish nor euphoric — the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) followed its recent pattern: starting strong in the morning, then losing momentum around midday when U.S. funds usually enter the market, only to rely on domestic support later. Yesterday, minor boosts came from Coca-Cola HBC (+1.13% at €39.22) and Eurobank (+0.39% at €3.63), but the market eventually slipped, closing at 2,045.81 points, down 0.54%, near the day’s low. Total trading value reached €252.83 million, including €14.48 million in 19 block trades. Aegean Airlines, with €2 million in turnover, gained 3.01%, closing at €13.70. Tomorrow night, Standard & Poor’s will release its new rating for Greece’s sovereign credit. In smaller-cap stocks, trading remains highly speculative, often moving on just a few tens of thousands of euros — making any trend fragile and easily reversible. At the end of 2020, a startup was founded in Greece with the goal of changing the way people lease cars — offering flexibility, good prices, and “complete services.” FlexCar, founded by Konstantinos Davaris and Giorgos Desyllas (co-founders and CEO–CFO respectively), has shown impressive growth in recent years. However, in recent days, FlexCar customers have been receiving messages and letters announcing dramatic rent increases of up to +30%. “For us, it’s not just the vehicle,” the letter reads. “It’s everything that comes with it: full maintenance, technical inspection, 24/7 roadside assistance, full insurance coverage, a replacement vehicle, and the option to change or buy out the car.” “The increases in maintenance costs, spare parts, and insurance have significantly affected the car market.” As a result, FlexCar announces that: “…from your upcoming lease period, the new monthly rent for your vehicle” will increase by +30%. For example, a Toyota Yaris goes from €366.81 to €460, and a VW Polo from €271.40 to €320. For now, there’s no information on whether other companies will follow suit. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, gave an interview to CNBC yesterday, revealing the next big bet of the world’s largest asset manager — which oversees $10 trillion in portfolios: “Forget paper — everything will become tokens.” According to Fink, every asset — real estate, stocks, bonds, even works of art — will be turned into digital tokens operating on a blockchain. “We are only at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to stocks and bonds. There are $4.1 trillion globally in digital wallets. If we could tokenize an ETF, we could bring crypto investors into long-term retirement products. This is the next wave of opportunity for BlackRock.” Instead of holding a piece of paper proving stock ownership, an investor will hold a token. Instead of buying an entire apartment, they’ll buy 0.5% of a property as a token. The $4.1 trillion in digital wallets globally represents funds invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies — mostly speculative, not long-term investments like pension funds or ETFs. BlackRock aims to bridge that gap. If an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) were tokenized, crypto investors could buy it directly from their digital wallets — no banks, intermediaries, or traditional accounts required. BlackRock has already secured approval for a Bitcoin ETF in 2024, attracting billions in just a few months. Tokenizing financial markets promises 24/7 trading, unlike traditional exchanges that close overnight. It also offers instant settlement (instead of 2–3 days) and greater accessibility (you can invest with just €10). Of course, uncertainties and big questions remain: Who regulates these tokens? How is transaction reliability ensured? What happens if you lose your wallet password? Fink said we’re at the beginning of this revolution. If he’s right, the financial system in 10 years will be unrecognizable. If not, it’ll be just another trend that flared up and burned out. The Financial Times revealed yesterday that four tech giants — BlackRock, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Elon Musk’s xAI — have formed a consortium to acquire one of the world’s largest data center operators for $40 billion. Nvidia controls 90% of the AI chip market and wants to ensure its clients have access to infrastructure. Microsoft is investing billions in AI but depends on third parties for servers. Musk needs data centers to expand Grok without relying on competitors. Data centers — the “brains” of artificial intelligence — are now considered the most valuable real estate in technology. The four companies would control the chain from the chip (Nvidia), to the cloud (Microsoft), to the AI model (xAI), and the software itself. For now, the war for dominance in AI is being fought with steel, concrete, and massive amounts of energy. Explore related questions

Title: AI stock frenzy sparks bubble fears as valuations skyrocket

Some argue open-source AI could mitigate risks of centralized control and financial instability. A historic surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has Wall Street buzzingâbut also bracing for a potential crash. Nvidia, once a niche chipmaker, now boasts a staggering $4.5 trillion valuation, while OpenAIâs deals with tech giants like Microsoft, AMD and Oracle raise concerns about financial circularity. With industry leaders warning of overinvestment and economists comparing the frenzy to past bubbles, the question looms: Is AI the next dot-com bust waiting to happen? The AI stock surge: Euphoria or excess? Since ChatGPTâs 2022 debut, AI has dominated markets. Nvidiaâs chips power the AI revolution, fueling its meteoric rise. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta have also seen explosive growth, collectively driving 80% of S&P 500 gains. Oracleâs stock soared 40% in a single day after securing OpenAI contractsâa sign of investor euphoria. But skepticism mounts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admits investors are "overexcited," while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos warns of an "industrial bubble." Bank of England analysts caution that markets are "exposed" if AI optimism falters. The parallels to the late-1990s dot-com bubbleâwhen vendor financing inflated valuations before a brutal crashâare hard to ignore. Circular deals and financial engineering Recent AI financing arrangements have drawn scrutiny for their self-reinforcing nature: Nvidia invests $100B in OpenAI, which then builds data centers using Nvidia chips. OpenAI buys AMD chips, taking a potential 10% stake in the company. Microsoft funds OpenAI while also relying on Nvidia-powered cloud services. Critics call this "vendor financing"âa tactic used during the dot-com bubble to artificially inflate demand. Goldman Sachs acknowledges "elements of investor behavior" mirror past bubbles but argues todayâs AI boom is backed by real profitsâfor now. The bubble debate: Optimism vs. caution Proponents insist AIâs transformative potential justifies the spending. OpenAIâs revenue growth is unprecedented, and Altman argues the industry is still undervalued. Federal Reserve officials even suggest this could be a "good bubble," driving innovation despite financial risks. Yet MIT research found that 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver returns, despite $30â40B in spending. Venture capitalist Alan Patricof warns, "The losses will be pretty significant." Meanwhile, AIâs impact on jobs remains uncertainâAnthropicâs CEO predicts mass white-collar layoffs, while McKinsey sees AI as a productivity booster, not a replacement. The road ahead: Crash or correction? Three scenarios could burst the AI bubble: Concentration risk: If OpenAI or Nvidia stumble, a domino effect could destabilize the sector. Governance failures: Poor oversight (like FTXâs collapse) could trigger regulatory crackdowns. Technological disruption: Quantum computing breakthroughs could render current AI infrastructure obsolete. Despite warnings, AIâs momentum shows no signs of slowing. The question isnât if but when reality catches upâand whether the fallout will be a minor correction or a catastrophic crash. A bubble with a fifference? Unlike the dot-com era, todayâs AI investments are fueled by trillion-dollar tech giants with vast cash reservesânot speculative startups. Yet history suggests unchecked exuberance rarely ends well. Whether AI reshapes the economy or becomes the next speculative bust, one truth remains: Investors should tread carefully.

Title: BlackRock CEO thinks tokenization of all assets is just ‘beginning’ – Details

How far could tokenizing real-world assets really go? Fink called tokenization a game-changing innovation that lets investors, including crypto holders, access long-term products like ETFs on blockchain platforms. BlackRock currently manages BUIDL, a tokenized money market fund with $2.8 billion AUM. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck an optimistic tone in a recent interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. He highlighted the firm’s strong third-quarter results, while also touching upon its expanding footprint across key financial verticals. Fink noted that the company’s growth has been broad-based, driven by robust performances in cash management, AI-powered equity strategies, and blockchain initiatives. Looking ahead, he spotlighted the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, equities, and bonds, as the “next wave of opportunity.” He also positioned this initiative as a central pillar of BlackRock’s long-term innovation strategy. Fink said, “You know, I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities.” During the interview, Fink also outlined how tokenization could fundamentally transform the investment landscape. He explained that blockchain-based tokenization would bridge traditional finance with digital infrastructure. This approach would allow investors, even those using digital wallets or crypto holdings, to seamlessly access conventional long-term financial products such as ETFs. As part of this vision, Fink revealed that BlackRock already operates a tokenized money market fund – BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity (BUIDL) Fund. It also manages one of the largest Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs in existence, with assets surpassing $100 billion. In short, once a crypto skeptic, Fink candidly admitted that he now “loves it,” signaling how institutional confidence in digital assets has evolved over the years. Fink also cited decades of market resilience, from the dot-com crash to the pandemic. In doing so, he emphasized that staying invested through volatility allows compounding to work in investors’ favor. The discussion arose on the back of BlackRock’s rapid growth across markets. Its Spot-based Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs remain the largest of their kind in the U.S, with $93 billion and $17 billion in AUM, respectively. Beyond ETFs, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), launched in partnership with tokenization firm Securitize, now manages $2.8 billion across Ethereum, Solana [SOL], and Avalanche [AVAX]. This makes it the largest tokenized money market fund to date. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was hovering around $111,828, following modest gains of 0.3% in 24 hours. As it stands, BlackRock plans to expand its tokenized products, potentially including its flagship crypto and traditional ETFs. In facr, according to a Bloomberg report, BlackRock is exploring plans to bring stocks and other real-world assets on-chain, allowing them to trade as digital tokens. In short, all these moves could position the firm at the forefront of Wall Street’s tokenization revolution.

Title: Paddy McCarthy is match-sharp and ready if called upon for Ireland debut against Japan

Paddy McCarthy will be hoping it’s second time lucky after being named in Andy Farrell’s Ireland squad for the four November Tests. The 22-year-old prop was one of 11 uncapped players who travelled to take on Georgia and Portugal during the summer but while nine made their debuts, McCarthy and Ulster scrumhalf Nathan Doak missed out. That fate is unlikely to befall him again, with a crack at Japan at the Aviva Stadium on November 8th a likely occasion for his first cap. Paddy is the youngest of three McCarthy boys alongside Leinster, Ireland and Lions secondrow Joe and the eldest, Andrew, a former Leinster culture captain and a member of the Seapoint Dragons mixed ability team. Paddy started in Old Belvedere minis before attending Blackrock College where he won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup under the captaincy of hooker Gus McCarthy, who has gone on to represent Leinster and Ireland. Centre Hugh Cooney, also from that Blackrock schools side, has featured for Leinster while Ruben Moloney, Liam Molony and Oliver Coffey are in the Leinster academy. Tom Brigg is in Ulster’s academy, while Conor O’Shaughnessy and Mikey Yarr are in Connacht’s. McCarthy’s talent, athleticism, speed, power, capacity to break or beat tackles and facility to play both sides of the frontrow made him a standout player in the Ireland Under-20’s Grand Slam-winning team in 2023. That team went to South Africa that summer and reached the World Junior Championship final, where they lost to France. He made his Leinster senior debut in October of that year, coming on as a replacement against Glasgow Warriors, and won a further three caps before Christmas. Injuries limited his involvement thereafter and he made just two further appearances, but he played for Ireland in an A international against England at Bristol and was then selected for the summer tour to Tbilisi and Lisbon. Having come on against the Stormers in the first game of the season, he made his first start for Leinster in his seventh cap for the province against the Bulls. McCarthy then retained his place in the run-on team for last weekend’s win over the Sharks at the Aviva Stadium. His latest performance was a tour de force that showcased all of those qualities listed above. There’s little doubt he benefits from being in an environment where he is subjected to rigorous daily challenges laid down by his fellow Leinster props in the Ireland squad – Andrew Porter, Jack Boyle, Tadhg Furlong and Thomas Clarkson. The call-up is a fitting reward for an outstanding prospect. Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: US, China still committed to global debt efforts, IMF strategy chief says

The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and current G20 president South Africa issued a progress report after the meeting, calling for continued efforts to address elevated debt vulnerabilities, particularly in low-income countries. It said debt levels in low-income countries and emerging economies had generally stabilised but remained higher than during the pre-COVID-19 era, with a few being particularly vulnerable. Many also faced elevated debt-service challenges, crowding out spending on education, health and infrastructure. "Recent shifts in global policies and cuts in foreign aid add to the challenges," the report said, underscoring the need for domestic reforms by debtor countries to boost growth, with specific attention to rising domestic debt vulnerabilities. Participants agreed to keep working to improve debt restructuring processes, including looking for ways to accelerate the restructuring of non-bonded commercial debt, accelerating support to countries with sustainable debt but high debt-service challenges, and strengthening transparency. IMF strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu said the continued participation of the US and China in the roundtable, despite a fierce trade war dividing the world's two largest economies, showed their commitment to keep addressing the high debt levels hurting developing countries. The roundtable, which met during the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, had led to progress in shortening the timelines of official debt restructurings and reworking bonded debt, but there was more work to do on non-bonded debt, Pazarbasioglu told reporters before the meeting. "These discussions have been important to get everyone on the same page," she said. "The fact that tomorrow we will have the US Treasury Secretary (Scott Bessent) there, China will be there, and others will be there, is a sign that they are still committed to this discussion." The progress report showed that transparency was a shared concern, especially regarding non-bonded debt. "Non-bonded debt is the laggard at this point," Pazarbasioglu said, noting some countries had moved through a restructuring but still faced bank exposures or other loans that prevented credit ratings agencies from removing their default status and raising ratings. "This is a critical step to make sure that countries are able to access lower cost financing. So that's what we are really focusing on now," she said. A recent IMF paper detailed the challenges faced by such countries - including Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia and Suriname. The report cited broad support for earlier and more comprehensive publication by official creditor committees of the key terms of restructurings - including the net present value reduction - once an agreement was reached, though full consensus had not yet been reached. Participants also broadly supported extending to all G20 creditors the World Bank's "Debt Data Sharing Exercise," which ensures the data of debtors and creditors are reconciled. Many of them expressed strong interest in the World Bank's proposal for a digital platform to automate loan data reconciliation, building on a pilot program launched with Indonesia, it said. Negotiators continue to work on a declaration on debt issues that the Group of 20 major economies, which launched the Common Framework for debt restructurings during the COVID-19 pandemic, hopes to issue on Thursday, participants said. Global debt is at record levels, but many emerging markets have actually reduced their debt-to-GDP ratios, although they still face crushing debt service payments and have been crowded out of the capital market by advanced economies. Liquidity is a bigger concern now than solvency, Pazarbasioglu said. Debt experts say high borrowing costs on international capital markets have effectively shut out many riskier borrowers, pushing governments to opt for loans where terms and conditions are rarely published. Jose Vinals, former group chairman of Standard Chartered, one of the two private-sector creditors together with BlackRock that are part of the global sovereign debt roundtable, said more transparency was clearly needed. "This is something that complicates enormously the restructuring processes and I think one of the things where progress needs to be made," he said during an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee late on Tuesday. Loans lack mechanisms such as collective action clauses often written into bonds that help to streamline sovereign debt restructurings by allowing a majority of bondholders to bind the minority to a new deal and prevent "holdout" creditors. He also pointed to working groups such as the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt, launched in June by the British government to help make contracts clearer and more transparent, as improving the way loan terms address natural disasters, and addressing problems with group lending practices. Almost all international bond and loan contracts across emerging markets use England and New York as jurisdictions.

On Wednesday, during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, top officials gathered to discuss debt vulnerabilities in developing countries and explore solutions for improved debt management. (Source: Reuters) The meeting included top officials from the U.S. and China, alongside representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and South Africa as the current G20 president. The discussions focused on the lack of transparency in commercial bank loans, which complicates debt restructuring efforts in developing nations. Debt levels in low-income and emerging economies have generally stabilised but remain higher than in the pre-COVID-19 era. Some countries are particularly vulnerable, and elevated debt servicing obligations limit spending on essential sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure. Recent global policy shifts and cuts in foreign aid have further increased these challenges. Participants agreed on the need to improve debt restructuring processes. This includes accelerating the restructuring of non-bonded commercial debt, supporting countries with sustainable debt but high debt-service obligations, and enhancing transparency in debt-related processes to make financing more accessible. IMF strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu highlighted that the participation of the U.S. and China, despite ongoing trade tensions, shows their commitment to addressing high debt levels in developing countries. While progress has been made in shortening official debt restructuring timelines, more work is needed to address non-bonded debt. Non-bonded debt remains a critical concern. Countries may complete restructuring of some loans but still face bank exposures or other debts that prevent credit rating improvements. The focus now is on ensuring that countries can access lower-cost financing, with Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia, and Suriname cited as examples facing challenges. The meeting showed broad support for early and comprehensive publication of restructuring terms once agreements are reached. Participants also backed extending the World Bank’s “Debt Data Sharing Exercise” to all G20 creditors. There is growing interest in a digital platform to automate loan data reconciliation, building on a pilot programme in Indonesia. Global debt has reached record levels, yet many emerging markets have reduced their debt-to-GDP ratios. Despite this, high debt-service obligations and limited access to capital markets remain major challenges. Liquidity is currently a bigger concern than solvency, and high borrowing costs push many governments toward non-transparent loan arrangements. Private-sector creditors, including Standard Chartered and BlackRock, emphasised the need for greater transparency in loan terms. Unlike bonds, many loans lack collective action clauses, complicating restructuring processes. Initiatives like the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt aim to improve contract clarity and address issues in group lending practices. Negotiators continue to work on a G20 declaration on debt issues. The goal is to enhance transparency, streamline restructuring, and provide support to vulnerable countries. Collaboration among nations, international organisations, and creditors is critical to address the growing challenges of global debt.

Title: Newly Launched Waypoint West Puts Liquidity Planning at the Center of Its Advisory Model

October 16, 2025 00:13 ET | Source: Waypoint West Waypoint West Photo courtesy of Waypoint West. SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waypoint West, the independent wealth advisor founded earlier this month by siblings Haley and Brooks Schaffer, underscored liquidity planning as a central focus of its offering for founders and builders. According to the firm’s briefing, entrepreneurs and senior employees often hold 70–90 percent of their net worth in company equity. Without careful preparation, more than half of that wealth can be lost to taxes at the point of liquidity. At the same time, companies are remaining private for 10–12 years on average before IPO, more than double the timeline of a generation ago, forcing individuals to manage concentrated positions for longer and seek innovative ways to unlock value. The firm noted that the challenge is amplified in today’s environment, where industries such as artificial intelligence are experiencing rapid transformation. It drew parallels to the dot-com bubble, when companies like AOL and Sun Microsystems were once considered untouchable but eventually faded, while others such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft went on to become enduring leaders. The takeaway for founders and employees: concentration can feel safe inside an iconic company, but diversification is what sustains wealth. Waypoint West stated that the goal of its program is to put structure and strategy around liquidity events, positioning them as turning points for long-term financial independence rather than short-term transactions. The firm emphasized the importance of beginning planning 12 to 24 months ahead, when strategies can be coordinated across a client’s full team of advisors, including estate planners, tax specialists, and legal counsel, to maximize after-tax outcomes. The program highlights a toolkit of public-market solutions that can be customized to client needs, including options-based hedges, exchange funds, custom ETFs and direct indexing, long/short overlays, and, where appropriate, simple sale and reinvest strategies. Waypoint West noted that as an independent RIA operating in an open-architecture framework, it sources across custodians, banks, and counterparties to design the optimal mix for a client rather than relying on a single provider. The firm also pointed to the rise of private-market liquidity solutions as companies stay private longer. These include secondary sales, NAV or portfolio loans, and structured financing arrangements tied to company performance. While each approach carries trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity, and signaling, Waypoint West said it helps clients evaluate these paths in the context of broader retirement, family, and philanthropic goals. By positioning liquidity as both a financial and life event, Waypoint West is seeking to fill a gap for founders, builders, and early employees who face unique challenges in converting on-paper wealth into enduring prosperity.

No more FOMO. Any tips on which filaments to order for a first timer? Just ordered the P2S combo from the deal, hoping to print using only PLA for board game inserts, basic models and things like that :) PLA will be the easiest to print with - for models, I recommend PLA Meta, which is great for printing fine details, and comes in a lot of colour variety (which conveniently is the cheapest in this deal!). TPU is surprisingly handy too, so I'd recommend grabbing a roll of that to play with, great when you need something nearly indestructible and rubbery. If you're after some stronger materials, PETG is a good starter option too, but I tend to find I'm not using it too much due to it never printing as nicely as PLA or ABS. ABS and ASA create some noxious odours when printing, and have a tendency to warp, so may cause problems when printing, but have extra heat resistance and strength that can be useful. Your printer will handle these and the higher-grade engineering filaments too (like carbon fibre filaments, nylon, polycarbonate, or PPA) but PLA Meta is a really great start point. Thank you so much for your detailed reply, I really appreciate it! Possibly the most helpful reply I've seen on ozb in the last week or two! Everyone be more like Flippsy PLA is much easier to use. If you are using it for board game inserts, you will want more grey as it looks nicer. You might also want a variety of different colours if you are printing tokens. So for wood pieces you might want chocolate as a colour or red/blue/yellow/green to print player dashboards for something like Catan. Congrats! I bought the P1S for my 10yr old during their Anniversary Sale. The P2S looks to be a step up. Getting eBay forcing a postage cost on a random filament when in cart, even though items say free postage on the item page. when I remove the product that has postage, it adds it to another one that didn't have postage cost before, anyone else seeing this too? I had this when it didn't like my postage address. It would add $10 postage. When I updated the suburb and postcode it went back to free. Excludes QLD South East? I'm South East and just checked the first link, I get free shipping and can use that code? Yeah the coverage is a bit more than those exclusions - I've updated the post to be a bit more accurate. Some stores will also ship to regional areas and charge a fee. South East QLD is where the capital city is though heh Anyone have any experience with PLA meta? Is it any different from PLAs you can get from Bambu's official store? I use PLA meta for printing figurines and models, I find that it has less noticeable layer lines and a smooth finish without being overly shiny, compared to the other PLAs. One minor downside is that when printing with supports, the scarring can be a bit more noticeable compared to PLA matte or PLA+, leaving white discolouration. It's pretty comparable to Bambu's PLA basic, just a lot cheaper. Awesome, thanks for sharing!

Title: Microsoft and Nvidia-backed AI consortium buys Aligned Data Centers for $40B
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/15/microsoft-nvidia-backed-ai-consortium-buys-aligned-data-centers-40b/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T01:57:08Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 21:57 EDT / OCTOBER 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley An artificial intelligence infrastructure consortium led by Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and BlackRock Inc. today announced it’s planning to buy Aligned Data Centers LLC in a deal valued at about $40 billion. It’s one of the largest-ever acquisitions of data centers, designed to secure vast and highly coveted AI computing capacity for the consortium’s members. The consortium, known as the AI Infrastructure Partnership or AIP, was formed last year by BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit, Abu Dhabi’s state-backed investment group MGX and Microsoft. Nvidia and Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. joined the consortium in March, along with Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Ltd. and the Kuwait Investment Authority. Founded in 2013, Aligned Data Centers has emerged as one of the major winners of the AI infrastructure spending boom. It operates a number of colocation data centers that rent capacity to customers, and it also builds data center facilities for hyperscale and enterprise firms. It currently operates data centers in Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Northern Virginia, and it’s building additional sites in Illinois, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia. In addition, it has a massive operation in Latin America, having acquired a company called OData in May 2023, which has facilities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. It’s also an investor in the Canadian data center operator QScale SEC, which gives it a foothold in that country, too. All told, it operates 50 data centers globally, amounting to 5 gigawatts of compute capacity. In January, Aligned was boosted by a $12 billion capital injection that came from two sources – $5 billion in primary equity from its current parent company Macquarie Asset Management LLC and $7 billion in new debt commitments. Aligned’s customers include the data center software company Nutanix Inc. and the information technology services provider Datto Inc. The AIP consortium said the acquisition will help it to accelerate its mission of “advancing the infrastructure and innovation needed to power the future of AI.” “With AIP, MGX and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data center infrastructure,” said Aligned Data Centers Chief Executive Andrew Schaap. The acquisition is just the latest example of how big technology companies are funneling billions of dollars into the infrastructure required to power their AI innovations. The likes of Google LLC parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., CoreWeave Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft have committed to spending more than $400 billion on AI data centers this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle and SoftBank Group Corp. on the $500 billion Stargate initiative that aims to build a cluster of data centers in the U.S. In addition, the ChatGPT maker has also struck deals with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc. that may eventually be worth over $1 trillion to secure the AI accelerators needed to fill those data centers, which will have a combined capacity of around 26 gigawatts. Meta also has plans to build a number of new data centers in the U.S., including a newly announced $1.5 billion facility in Texas and a massive complex in Louisiana called “Hyperion” that’s expected to provide 5 gigawatts of capacity when it comes fully online in 2030. The enormous spending on data centers is the AI industry’s equivalent of the “gold rush”, with companies hunting for computing resources rather than precious metals, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. “It’ll take time to see if these efforts pay off, but the deal makes sense because data centers take a long time and a lot of money to build,” he said. “It’s a solid acquisition because Aligned has been building and operating data centers for years, and so this expertise will come in handy too.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Oct 16, 2025, 07:52 AM Updated Oct 16, 2025, 10:14 PM Bengaluru – An investor group including Singapore’s Temasek, BlackRock, Microsoft and Nvidia is buying one of the world’s biggest data centre operators with nearly 80 facilities in a deal worth US$40 billion (S$51.8 billion) to secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence (AI). The deal is the biggest-ever data centre transaction as companies race to lock in AI computing power. Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Texas, currently has 50 campuses in the US and South America. It has 78 data centres under management or in future development, according to its website. Its purchase from Australia’s Macquarie Asset Management on Oct 15 is also the first deal for the AI Infrastructure Partnership, formed in 2024. The partnership includes Temasek, the Kuwait Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi-based fund MGX and Mr Elon Musk’s start-up xAI among its backers. “With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI,” said BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who also serves as the chairman of the AI Infrastructure Partnership. The acquisition is the latest in a series of big-ticket deals involving big tech and Silicon Valley start-ups, which the boom in AI has fuelled. Major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft and CoreWeave are on track to spend US$400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Morgan Stanley estimates. OpenAI, the start-up at the heart of the AI boom, struck deals in recent weeks with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom that may cost over US$1 trillion to secure about 26GW of computing capacity, enough to power roughly 20 million US homes. OpenAI, the start-up at the heart of the AI boom, struck deals in recent weeks Meta Platforms is building several multi-gigawatt AI data centres, including one called Prometheus, due to come online in 2026, and another, Hyperion, which can scale up to 5GW. Privately held Aligned Data Centers currently has over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Mr Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Nvidia shareholder Equity Armor Investments, said the acquisition highlights the growing value of data centre assets for investors. “They’re looking at rapid expansion to meet AI demand and optimise for it.” Founded in 2013, Aligned has been a big winner of the AI infrastructure spending boom, raising US$12 billion in equity and debt earlier in 2025 – one of the largest private capital injections into a data centre company. Its customers include cloud computing platform Nutanix and information technology services provider Datto, according to its website. The company also has a land portfolio with access to significant near-term power capacity in key markets, said Macquarie, which first invested in the company in 2018. Shares of its publicly-listed rivals, such as Applied Digital, have soared more than fourfold in 2025. Applied Digital shares jumped 5 per cent on Oct 15. The investment group buying Aligned has an initial target of deploying US$30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching US$100 billion including debt. It has not disclosed how much each partner has contributed to the group nor the equity value of the deal. Nvidia and Aligned declined to comment, while the investors did not immediately respond to requests seeking more details on the deal. “All the major parties in that consortium, they are showing the strength of the AI ecosystem,” said Mr Hendi Susanto, portfolio manager at Nvidia investor Gabelli Funds. Aligned will remain headquartered in Dallas, Texas, under CEO Andrew Schaap when the deal closes in the first half of 2026, the investor group said in its statement.

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by: Mihir Kshirsagar This week, Open AI announced a multibillion dollar deal with Broadcom to develop custom AI chips for data centers projected to consume 10 gigawatts of power. This investment is separate from another multibillion dollar deal OpenAI struck with AMD last week. There is no question that we are in the midst of making one of the largest industrial infrastructure bets in United States history. Eight major companies—Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, Oracle, OpenAI, and others—are expected to invest over $300 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025 alone. Spurred by news about the vendor-financed structure of the AMD investment and a conversation with my colleague Arvind Narayanan, I started to investigate the unit economics of the industry from a competition perspective. What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two. That said, I am open to being wrong in my analysis and welcome corrections as I write these thoughts up in an academic article with my colleague Felix Chen. Here is the puzzle: the chips at the heart of the infrastructure buildout have a useful lifespan of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear, but companies depreciate them over five to six years. In other words, they spread out the cost of their massive capital investments over a longer period than the facts warrant—what The Economist has referred to as the “$4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud.” This accounting mismatch has significant competition implications, especially upstream of the model layer of the GenAI stack. (Figure 1.) In the application layer enterprises choose AI models to integrate into their operations. Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available. The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage. Even if we ignore the accounting question, a September 2025 Bain report estimates that AI firms will face an annual $800 billion revenue hole in 2030 to fund their capital expenses—a gap larger than Amazon’s entire annual revenue. Per my calculations, this hole grows to over $1.5 trillion annually if the true total cost of ownership is taken into account. (For reference, that is roughly equivalent to the size of the global foodservice industry.) Even assuming these self-reported figures are inflated by 50%, the revenue challenge remains unprecedented in scale. If these coalitions establish durable customer relationships in the initial years, the market structure crystallized during this window may persist regardless of whether the underlying investment economics are sustainable at true replacement costs. The lessons from the efforts to unwind Google’s dominance of the search market are instructive here. Technical analyses have converged on estimating the useful lifespan of AI chips at one to three years. One unnamed Google architect assessed that GPUs running at 60-70% utilization—standard for AI workloads—survive one to two years, with three years as a maximum. The reason: thermal and electrical stress is simply too high. But physical failure isn’t the only concern. Technological obsolescence drives replacement cycles. Nvidia’s GB200 (“Blackwell”) chip provides 4-5x faster inference than the H100. When competitors deploy hardware with significantly better performance, three-year-old chips become economically obsolete even if they still function. Investment analysts have run the numbers on what happens if accounting catches up to reality. Barclays, for example, is cutting earnings forecasts of AI firms by up to 10% for 2025 to account for more realistic depreciation assumptions. The physical evidence, the technological trajectory, and the emerging financial data all point in the same direction: actual useful life is at least half the accounting life, and this does not even account for the significant operational expenditures required. These aren’t loose partnerships—they’re deeply integrated coalitions where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. True outsiders trying to compete at the application layer include companies like Cohere (enterprise-focused models), AI21 Labs, Mistral, and application builders like Harvey (legal AI), Glean (enterprise search), and Writer (enterprise content). Many have struggled to scale or ended up partnering with hyperscalers—Mistral now has a partnership with Microsoft, and Cohere partners with Oracle. The emerging pattern suggests that coalition membership is becoming necessary for survival. The accounting subsidy creates competitive advantages that flow through the coalition structure. A recent McKinsey analysis projects that approximately 60% of AI infrastructure spending in the next five years goes to computing hardware (chips, servers, memory), 25% to power and cooling infrastructure, and 15% to physical construction. Assuming half of the infrastructure spending goes to computing hardware with 1-3 year useful life: companies can depreciate this hardware over 5-6 years rather than the realistic 1-3 years. This effectively halves their reported annual depreciation expense. This cushion between reported costs and actual replacement economics creates a capital subsidy that allows coalition leaders to subsidize application-layer pricing, expand capacity faster than true economics justify, and report profitability metrics that attract capital on more favorable terms than their operational reality warrants. The Microsoft-OpenAI Example Microsoft’s Azure AI infrastructure investments, when depreciated over six years rather than the more realistic three years, allow Microsoft to report more attractive margins on its infrastructure business. Consider Microsoft’s ~$80 billion annual AI infrastructure spend. If half goes to computing hardware with a true three-year lifespan, Microsoft faces actual replacement costs of approximately $13 billion per year. But by depreciating over six years, Microsoft’s reported annual depreciation is only $6.5 billion—creating an apparent $6.5 billion annual cushion. This cushion enables Microsoft to subsidize OpenAI’s infrastructure costs during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. OpenAI can price its APIs aggressively to win enterprise customers while operating on a cost structure that wouldn’t be sustainable at true market rates for infrastructure. Microsoft benefits because every enterprise customer that integrates OpenAI’s models becomes more deeply embedded in the Azure ecosystem. The same pattern holds for Amazon-Anthropic. Amazon’s AWS can depreciate AI infrastructure over extended periods, subsidize Anthropic’s infrastructure costs through favorable terms, and benefit from the resulting AWS consumption as Anthropic wins customers. Incumbent coalitions can: New entrants—whether independent model developers or application builders—face steeper economics. Even with access to chips at market rates, they can’t match the pricing of model developers whose infrastructure is subsidized by hyperscaler partners using six-year depreciation. Their profitability looks worse on paper, making it harder to raise capital and compete for customers during the critical window when market structure is being determined. The strategic bet: By years 4-5, when accounting reality might catch up to operational reality, customer relationships will be locked in through switching costs, integration depth, and organizational inertia. The durability of incumbent advantages involves some complex projections. Let me lay out three scenarios and examine how the accounting subsidy affects competition in each. If frontier models keep improving meaningfully with more compute, then training capacity matters more than inference efficiency. This is a strong assumption that does not appear supported by current science. Nevertheless, playing out this world, we see that model quality differentiates providers, customers pay premium prices for frontier capabilities, and incumbent coalitions who built massive training capacity have lasting advantages. The moat is capability-based, reinforced by infrastructure scale. Incumbent coalitions face profitability pressure when accounting catches up to operational reality, but they retain competitive advantages through superior models. New entrants with better unit economics can’t easily compete because the game is about model quality, not inference cost. The capital requirements are enormous and ongoing. Whoever builds scale first maintains advantages. There is also a policy question about whether private capital can sustain the hundred of billions in annual replacement cycles indefinitely, or whether maintaining leadership requires ongoing policy support once true costs become visible. If model capabilities hit diminishing returns and most models become “good enough,” competition shifts to inference efficiency, cost, and building applications. When the market power moves upstream, that creates the most troubling competitive dynamics. In this world, models plateau in capability, inference costs have fallen dramatically, and open source models match or approach proprietary quality. But incumbent coalitions who built scale in the early years retain advantages through: New entrants might have better unit economics, but if switching costs are high enough, customers stick. This is where the Google search case becomes the crucial analytical framework. The Justice Department’s case against Google in search provides a roadmap for understanding how customer lock-in can persist even when competitive alternatives exist with comparable or better economics. Google maintained search dominance through default placements and integration lock-in. Google paid billions annually to be the default search engine on Safari, Android devices, and elsewhere. These defaults created inertia: users rarely switched even when alternatives were “one click away.” The court found this lock-in was anticompetitive. The insight for AI infrastructure is that even in a market where switching takes literally a few clicks, default positions and integration created durable advantages that competitors couldn’t overcome with better economics or comparable quality. Now consider that switching costs are far higher in the AI market: In other words, the lock-in is to the entire hyperscaler infrastructure stack. If Google could maintain dominance in search with relatively low switching costs, how much more durable might AI application-layer lock-in prove when enterprises are deeply integrated into coalition stacks? There is an alternative scenario where the competitive effects could be less severe. Here, models plateau, inference commoditizes, and switching costs prove lower than expected. APIs standardize across providers, models are equally capable, price becomes the primary differentiator, and integration depth matters less than anticipated. New entrants can now compete effectively on price and service, leveraging newer, more efficient infrastructure. The early years’ investment by incumbents might look wasteful in retrospect. Better technology in newer chips defeats scale advantages on older infrastructure. For competition, this means there is no permanent foreclosure—just wasteful spending that created temporary advantages and shaped the market structure during a critical period, even though those advantages don’t persist. The short answer is that we don’t know yet. The available evidence suggests model capabilities have plateaued and inference scaling is the name of the game. As a result, inference costs will fall, but we don’t know how dramatically. Customer lock-in at the application layer might prove durable (like Google search) or weaker than expected. If we’re in Scenario B (models plateau, enterprise lock-in), the accounting subsidy lets incumbent coalitions foreclose competition at the application layer during the critical window, and switching costs prevent correction even when better alternatives emerge. This is the Google search outcome. If we’re in Scenario C (models plateau, low switching costs), the asset-life treatment enables wasteful overinvestment that may temporarily distort competition, but it does not create permanent harm to the market structure. One intuitive consideration is that better chips and algorithms should undermine incumbent advantages over time. The problem is that technology improvement helps everyone, but it helps incumbents more when lock-in exists. For coalitions with locked-in customers, capability expands through replacement spending alone. They are continuously upgrading infrastructure, and existing customers automatically benefit. New entrants with better technology have lower unit economics, but they still must acquire customers. This is challenging when customers are already integrated with the OpenAI APIs through Azure, operating under multi-year contracts, built compliance frameworks around the incumbent stack, facing switching costs that exceed savings from better technology, and receiving continuous capability upgrades from their current provider. The core insight from the Google search case: the technology deflation curve that should enable new entry actually reinforces incumbent advantages when lock-in is strong. The competitive dynamics become more concerning when combined with the circular financing structure at the heart of the AI infrastructure boom. The circular structure reinforces the coalition dynamics and makes it harder for new entrants to compete in the future. Nvidia has embarked on a strategy of making strategic equity investments in its customers. CoreWeave is the clearest example. Nvidia owns roughly 7% of the company, a stake worth about $3 billion as of June 2025. CoreWeave has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs—mostly H100s at roughly $30,000 each, totaling around $7.5 billion. Essentially, all the money Nvidia invested in CoreWeave has come back as revenue. In turn, CoreWeave signed $22.4 billion in contracts with OpenAI to provide AI infrastructure. Nvidia participated in OpenAI’s $6.6 billion funding round in October 2024, then announced a $100 billion investment commitment in September 2025. The circle takes shape: Nvidia invests in OpenAI. OpenAI signs contracts with CoreWeave. CoreWeave buys GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia has equity in CoreWeave. The money flows in a loop, with each transaction appearing as legitimate revenue or investment depending on which company’s books you examine. Not many details have been released about the AMD deal with OpenAI, but reports suggest it involves similar features of circular financing. We’ve seen circular vendor financing disrupt market structures before. During the late 1990s telecom boom, equipment makers financed their own customers to drive sales. Lucent offered $8.1 billion in vendor financing ($15.8 billion in today’s dollars), which represented 24% of revenue. Nortel had $3.1 billion ($6.0 billion today). And Cisco was $2.4 billion ($4.7 billion today). The strategy: lend money to cash-strapped telecom companies so they could buy your equipment. Everyone wins. You book revenue. Your customers build networks. The market bids up your stock. Repeat. Until the music stopped. Forty-seven competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. When customers defaulted, vendor financing became bad debt. Lucent wrote off $3.5 billion in customer loans. Today’s numbers are larger. Nvidia’s disclosed investments and financing commitments total roughly $110 billion against $165 billion in last-twelve-months revenue. That’s 67% of revenue—nearly three times Lucent’s exposure at the peak. There are crucial differences. First, there are no allegations of fraud or any untoward activity. Second, the competitive implications differ because of asset lifespans. In telecom, assets had long useful lives. When companies went bankrupt, carriers could buy that fiber at fire-sale prices and use it for decades. The short lifespan of AI chips changes this fundamentally. If the current buildout proves excessive and coalitions face financial pressure, excess capacity won’t be available for new entrants to acquire and deploy effectively. Three-year-old chips at fire-sale prices don’t provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Even if the circular financing unwinds, it won’t necessarily enable competitive entry at the application layer. The evidence shows that the market structure is being determined by competition among 3 coalitions, with no realistic path for true outsiders to compete at the application layer during the critical window when customer relationships are being formed. Competition authorities are starting to look at market concentration in AI, focusing on traditional antitrust metrics: market share, pricing power, exclusionary conduct. As far as I know, the competitive effects of vendor financing and accounting policy have not yet been discussed extensively. Two policy proposals can help maintain competition. First, enhanced disclosure requirements about capital and operating costs. Any AI infrastructure project receiving government support should disclose realistic useful life assumptions for hardware, expected replacement schedules and costs, total capital requirements under multiple technology scenarios, relationships between vendor financing and equipment procurement, partnership economics showing how infrastructure costs flow from hyperscalers to model developers, and analysis of customer lock-in mechanisms at the application layer. Second, developing interoperability standards to prevent lock in. Interoperable standards on model APIs and cloud integration frameworks make it easier for enterprises to switch between providers. The Google search remedy focused on reducing switching costs—the same principle applies here. In summary, the market structure for AI firms is coalescing around models that rely on a combination of massive capital flows, circular financing structures, and accounting assumptions that may not match operational reality. The accounting subsidy enables incumbent coalitions to establish market share in the early years, when critical customer relationships at the application layer are being formed. The Google search case demonstrates that lock-in can be decisive even with low switching costs. AI application-layer integration has far higher switching costs. As I’ve said, we don’t yet know which scenario we’re in. But the decisions being made now—based on assumptions that may overstate financial sustainability by a factor of two—are determining the future market for AI services at the application level.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Blackstone is officially under contract to sell Park Avenue Tower for nearly the same price the 36-story office building fetched 11 years ago. SL Green will acquire the 622,000-square-foot property at 65 East 55th Street for $730 million, sources told Commercial Observer. Blackstone subsidiary EQ Office (now known as Perform Properties) purchased the Midtown Manhattan office asset for $750 million in 2014 from Shorenstein Company. Eastdil Secured’s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the latest megadeal, sources said, which went under contract yesterday. The sale of Park Avenue Tower is being executed nearly a decade after EQ Office undertook a $25 million renovation project following the exit of the building’s anchor tenant, law firm Paul Hastings, which relocated to the MetLife Building, as CO reported at the time. Perform Properties inked a 17,458-square-foot lease from Reinsurance Group of America in August, to house the St. Louis-based global reinsurance firm’s first New York office, CO previously reported. Other tenants include Panagram Structured Asset Management and Quilvest Capital Partners. Just last month, SL Green also snapped up 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th Street for $160 million just last month. “This acquisition will deliver sustainable cash flow and provide long-term value creation while further solidifying our commitment to being the leading owner of premier properties along Park Avenue at a time when demand has never been higher,” Harrison Sitomer, chief investment officer at SL Green, said in a statement announcing the Park Avenue Tower acquisition. “Park Avenue Tower is strategically located and well-leased at below-market rents, offering significant upside as vacancy in the Park Avenue corridor continues to trend below six percent.” The property in the deal was part of a Blackstone fund that is 95 percent realized and generated a 14 percent internal rate of return. “This successful exit from a substantially realized fund capitalizes on the strong rebound in demand for office in Midtown Manhattan and demonstrates the momentum for recently renovated office assets in prime submarkets,” the Blackstone spokesperson said in a statement. Eastdil Secured did not immediately return a request for comment. Andrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Photo / Getty Images A consortium led by asset manager BlackRock, including chip giant Nvidia and Microsoft, is set to acquire data centre specialist Aligned Data Centres from Australian financial services group Macquarie for approximately US$40 billion ($69.9b). The deal marks another sign of the tech sector’s insatiable appetite for AI infrastructure, including chips, servers, and data centres that provide the computing storage and processing power required by artificial intelligence. And it comes on the heels of Macquarie’s A$23b deal to sell Australian and Asia Pacific data centre operator AirTrunk to Blackstone for A$23.5b and the rise and rise in valuation of Canberra Data Centres, half-owned by NZX-listed Infratil. On October 7, Infratil said the latest 2025 independent valuation of CDC showed an increase of A$77 million since June 30 to A$13.6b, making its 49.72% stake worth a new high of A$6.8b. Founded in 2013, Aligned currently operates more than 50 data centres across the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, with a projected capacity exceeding 5 gigawatts. Macquarie initially acquired a stake in the Texas-based company in 2018 through its subsidiary Macquarie Asset Management and subsequently increased its investment in 2020. The acquiring consortium consists of BlackRock, Emirati sovereign tech fund MGX, and the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), a joint venture established by BlackRock in 2024 that includes BlackRock, MGX, Nvidia, and Microsoft. AIP plans to raise US$30b in direct investments and leverage debt to achieve a total investment capacity of US$100b. The partners have not disclosed how equity will be distributed among Aligned’s new shareholders following the transaction’s completion, expected in the first half of 2026. “We are entering a new era in which AI will fundamentally re-engineer our economies and enable accelerated growth,” said Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, CEO of MGX and vice-chairman of AIP, in a press release. BlackRock CEO and AIP chairman Larry Fink said the acquisition enabled its clients to participate in the growth of AI. -Agence France-Presse with Herald staff After 75 years on NZ shelves, Reader’s Digest has moved on to the digital world.

Title: Argentina First? Trump Treasury Sec Reveals Bailout Amount Has Doubled
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/201811/donald-trump-treasury-secretary-argentina-bailout-doubled
Time Published: 2025-10-15T18:56:32Z
Full Content:
One day after Donald Trump celebrated a multibillion-dollar bailout for Argentina, his administration moved to double the ante. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters at the Treasury building Wednesday that the United States is “working on a $20 billion facility that would be adjacent” to the $20 billion credit swap line Trump already approved, totaling $40 billion in assistance for the economically fragile South American country. “Many banks are interested in it, and many sovereign funds,” Bessent said. “It is a private-sector solution to Argentina’s upcoming debt payments.” The aid is intended to salvage Argentina’s collapsing economy ahead of the country’s October 26 midterm elections. That vote will determine if Argentine President Javier Milei, one of Trump’s international allies, will maintain the ability to pursue his dramatic cost-cutting agenda. But there’s another notable beneficiary of the Trump admin’s Argentina bailout package: major hedge funds led by Bessent’s friends. Several major investment funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, stand to significantly gain from the aid transfer, as do several independent investors with ties to Bessent, The New York Times reported earlier this month. Bessent described the exchange Wednesday as an “economic Monroe Doctrine,” referring to the 1823 policy that rejected European intervention and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. “Much better to use the heft of the U.S. economic power rather than have to use military power,” Bessent continued, comparing the situation to the supposed “narco traffic coming out of Venezuela.” But the White House’s planned Argentina bailout is remarkably hypocritical for an administration that has axed critical executive agencies under the auspice of slashing spending. Stateside, the government is still shut down over how to fund Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included cuts of billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid—a shutdown that Bessent himself claimed Wednesday was costing America “$15 billion a day.” And the U.S. will likely need a bailout of its own very soon. American soybean farmers have been pummeled by Trump’s tariff policies, which have ripped the Chinese market from their grasp. However, after it came to light that Argentina had replaced the U.S. as China’s top soybean supplier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the anticipated Argentina-bound cash infusion had morphed into a “credit swap line.” House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that harassment, assault, and stolen valor allegations against Republican Representative Cory Mills are not “serious” matters of discussion at a Wednesday press conference. A Florida judge on Tuesday issued a restraining order against Mills, after his ex-girlfriend alleged that he had threatened to blackmail her using sexually explicit images of her and to commit violence against her future romantic partners. Johnson bristled at reporters after being asked twice about the matter. Responding to a question from NBC News’s Melanie Zanona, Johnson initially claimed to have “not heard or looked into the details of that.” NOTUS’s Reese Gorman followed up, noting additional scandals—two out of a bevy of others—that Mills has faced, i.e., a different woman once accused him of assaulting her at his apartment, which she since recanted, and Mills, an Army veteran, has also been accused of stolen valor, including by military veterans who served alongside him. “Are you concerned about these allegations?” Gorman asked. Johnson told him to ask Mills, whom he called “a faithful colleague,” before pleading ignorance of the allegations. “Let’s talk about things that are really serious,” said the speaker, growing cross, before taking another question. Federal agents arrested a Portland mother who was playing the “Ghostbusters” theme song on her clarinet at a protest outside an ICE facility. Oriana Korol, 38, is a member of the Unpresidented Brass Band, which calls itself a “social action oriented, horn driven marching band,” and seeks to deescalate protest tensions. In a video of her arrest from Sunday, a federal agent can be seen violently dragging Korol to the ground, as two more agents come to his aid and her clarinet falls out of her hands. She has been in Clark County Jail in Vancouver, Washington, since, and is still being held without bail. Video of the Portland clarinet player being arrested.Honestly ditching the black bloc in favor of silly costumes, naked bike rides & brass bands is politically quite ingenious. It makes ICE look utterly foolish in any footage that appears on the news average Joe watches. pic.twitter.com/FY87x9xKGr “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone running, and then a federal officer running after them. By the time I turned around, this person had been tackled to the ground, and there was an officer on top of them,” said Mike Thompson, Korol’s bandleader. “This was happening right at Oriana’s feet. And she was kind of, they were kind of pinned against a fence,” he said. Korol’s husband didn’t know she’d been transported across state lines until 2 a.m. the next morning. “It is a beautiful party atmosphere. Everybody’s really excited. Then the band hits into ‘Ghostbusters,’ and then at ‘Ghostbusters,’ that’s when ICE start storming in,” Korol’s husband told KOIN 6. “Why are they targeting a clarinet player? A clarinet player standing on the sidewalk far away from the street, following instructions. “We’re not seeing her. We don’t know when we’re going to see her again,” he added, referring to himself and their 3-year-old child. This arrest is yet another example of the excessive, indiscriminate, and in some instances unlawful actions that the federal agents who’ve flooded American cities in the past few months have taken. On Tuesday, federal agents in Chicago violated a freshly minted temporary restraining order banning them from tear-gassing civilians, also gassing local police officers in the process. The Portland Mutual Aid Network has called for Korol’s release, urging supporters to call the Clark County Jail. “Oriana Korol was peacefully protesting ICE on 10/12 and was illegally detained by ICE and DHS,” their statement reads. “She is the clarinet player for Unpresidented Brass Band, and was playing music for protestors. Protesting for immigrants is not a crime!” Republicans are rushing to recast upcoming protests against President Donald Trump as anti-American rallies that are somehow prolonging the government shutdown. During an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the Democrats for a lack of movement on reopening the federal government, claiming that they were waiting to move until after the “No Kings Day” rally planned for October 18 opposing the administration’s authoritarian tilt. “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting to get this crazy ‘No Kings’ rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest-core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party which is, you know, a big title,” Bessent claimed. “You know, no kings equal no paychecks,” he added. During a propaganda press conference later Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson framed the upcoming “No Kings Day” as a “Hate America rally.” “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said. “I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display. The people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” Other Republicans were quick to join Johnson, with Representatives Steve Scalise and Lisa McClain also referring to the protest as the “Hate America rally.” Johnson started the trend of villainizing constitutionally protected protest last week when he inexplicably claimed that the “No Kings Day” demonstration was somehow to blame for the government shutdown. “It’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally, ’cuz they can’t face their rabid base,” Johnson said of Democrats at the time. For the past three weeks, GOP lawmakers have been phoning in that whole defending-the-Republic thing, ever since Johnson sent them home amid the ongoing government shutdown. It seems clear that it’s Republicans who have refused to negotiate with Democrats—not the other way around. Crucially, Republicans are blatantly mischaracterizing the attendees of the nationwide “No Kings” rally, in an attempt to criminalize dissent against Trump. These protests, which have been recurring since the beginning of the second Trump administration, have been notably tame, reportedly populated by older, liberal white people who love America but hate Trump’s policies. The temperate collective action would likely not be left enough for anyone who was ostensibly anti-fascist. Republicans’ outlandish predictions for who is likely to attend are simply setting the stage for law enforcement crackdowns on protesters’ First Amendment rights. The speaker’s suggestion that protesting the government is un-American is particularly disturbing, as it is not only a historically American activity, but also a foundational right supported by the U.S. Constitution—a right that Republicans such as Johnson seem to care about less and less everyday. The largest political advertisement spender of the year is: you, the U.S. taxpayer. While the rest of the Trump administration hatchets away at the federal budget, the Department of Homeland Security has gone on a spending spree to heap praise on Donald Trump. The agency has so far spent at least $51 million in 2025 on a sprawling ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to either exit the country or be “hunted down.” Fox News bought the bulk of the ad spots, airing $9 million worth of content, Axios reported Wednesday. America’s morning shows saw the most program-specific spending, with Today, CBS Morning, and Good Morning America leading the pack. Over the course of the last month, viewers of three programs consumed the most DHS advertising: the Mexican soccer league (Fútbol: Liga MX), Fox’s The Five, and Univision’s Despierta America. But the campaign has also had a digital arm targeting social media users. The ads have specifically targeted Spanish speakers and users who like Mexican pop music, Latin music, the Mexican Grand Prix, Latin cuisine, and the Mexican national soccer team, according to Meta ad library data obtained by Axios. Almost all the adverts feature DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Directly facing the camera, Noem suggests that undocumented immigrants are “violent criminals” flooding American cities with drugs, and accuses the Biden administration of taking a weak stance on border crossings. (Joe Biden increased border enforcement across the board and arrested an “unprecedented” number of immigrants that crossed illegally, according to the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.) One detail is consistent across all the DHS adspots: unmitigated applause for the current president’s agenda. “Strong borders mean a stronger America. President Trump is making America safe again,” Noem says at the end of one advert. Compare that to DHS’s last ad campaign under the Biden administration: a series of billboards in Texas that read a person “in immigration custody has rights.” That campaign cost $150,000, and did not feature President Joe Biden or former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In a now infamous September raid on a 130-unit apartment building in Chicago, hundreds of agents reportedly rappelled in from helicopters, kicked in doors, ransacked rooms, deployed flashbangs, and zip-tied people—immigrants and native Chicagoans, adults and children—in the middle of the night. Amid growing criticism of this heavy-handed blitz, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller defended the operation, calling it a “brilliantly executed raid against a Tren de Aragua complex filled with TdA terrorists.” (Tren de Aragua, or TdA, is a Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration, with characteristic alarmism, claims has “invaded the United States.”) So, how many members of the Venezuelan gang did they catch in the controversial September raid? DHS says that, of the 37 individuals arrested that night, agents got ahold of “just one ‘verified’ Tren de Aragua member,” MSNBC reported this week. It was previously reported that two of the 37 arrested were members of TdA, but even that disappointing figure was evidently overstating it. Further, DHS has yet to provide proof of the alleged gang member’s connection to TdA—a point worth noting, since the Trump administration has faced criticism for advancing weak claims of immigrants’ gang membership in service of its mass deportation campaign. This new finding lends itself to the conclusions Illinois Governor JB Pritzker shared in his recent conversation with TNR’s Greg Sargent about the raid: “If this was Pinochet’s Chile, if this was Argentina under authoritarian rule, maybe you’d call it successful,” he said, adding later, “Whenever the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and [Customs and Border Protection] agents say something, they put out a release or, you know, you’ve got Stephen Miller talking about it, they are lying.” Federal agents ended up tear-gassing Chicago police officers on Tuesday while trying to perform basic crowd control, violating a temporary restraining order banning the very use of tear gas in the process. A crowd of community members and protesters formed near 105th and Avenue N, where Border Patrol struck a civilian car while trying to arrest the people inside. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said that the crowd “eventually turned hostile,” forcing them to use “crowd control measures” like tear gas. CPD officers present were caught in the crossfire. About 13 officers were exposed to the tear gas, Chicago police said. This is the second time CPD officers have been gassed by ICE while trying to work with them. The federal agents are also blatantly ignoring the temporary restraining order sent down from Judge Sara Ellis on October 9, after journalists and community organizations brought the issue forward. Ellis explicitly banned the agents from “using riot control weapons,” “firing [tear gas] canisters,” “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual,” “striking any person with a vehicle,” and more abuses of power. The order applies to all agents from the Department of Homeland Security, including ICE and Border Patrol, and was supposed to last until October 23. The federal agents violated it almost immediately. Civilians have continued to be terrorized by these riot tactics. “The eyes and the nose ... it burned,” community member Pascal Manuel told NBC 5 Investigates. “This type of escalation is going to cause harm—it’s not the people of Chicago. It is the federal agents,” said Beatriz Ponce De Leon, Chicago’s deputy mayor of immigration and refugee rights. There is currently no update on the status of the temporary restraining order. Republican Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana appeared dumbstruck Tuesday night after his ridiculous attempts to blame Democrats for massive funding cuts to energy projects blew up in his face. During an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sheehy was asked about the $1 billion grant that the Department of Energy pulled from the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a clean energy project spanning Washington state, Oregon, and Montana. “They just yanked a billion dollars from that. So, is that taking away good paying jobs in Montana?” asked Collins. “Of course it is. As I said, we want the government to be open. You should be saying this to Chuck Schumer, who is closing the government down,” Sheehy replied. “I’m agreeing we should have the government open right now, this is an unnecessary shutdown.” Collins pressed whether Sheehy was acknowledging that President Donald Trump’s administration was hurting his state, prompting the Republican to launch into an unrelated list of federal services interrupted by the government shutdown. “So, this shutdown is not a good thing, and that’s why we don’t want it to continue,” he said. Collins tried to steer Sheehy back to the topic at hand. “The Trump administration didn’t have to make that decision, they decided to pull that billion dollars from your state,” she said. “Do you disagree with that?” “Well, I think the reality is we wouldn’t be here if the government was still open, and now we’re going on week three of a pretty unnecessary shutdown,” Sheehy repeated. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright had specifically told Collins earlier this month that the canceled grant had nothing to do with the shutdown, or the Democrats, for that matter. “He said they would’ve done that even if the government wasn’t shut down, that that was months in the making even before the government shut down,” Collins said. The two fell silent, as Sheehy’s desperate excuses evaporated. After a long moment, Sheehy replied: “Well, it’s unfortunate we’re still shut down. We shouldn’t be.” COLLINS: The Dept of Energy just canceled a billion dollars for a hydrogen hub that covers your state of Montana. Is that taking away good-paying jobs?SHEEHY: Of course it is. We want the govt to be openCOLLINS: But the Energy Secretary says they would've pulled that funding… pic.twitter.com/6AAfmldQf8 Last week, OMB Director Russell Vought—not Wright—declared that the Trump administration would cut nearly $8 billion in lawfully approved funding for energy projects, targeting 16 Democratic-led states. A longer list of grants to clean energy projects assembled by DOE senior staff totaling roughly $30 billion circulated Capitol Hill, alarming energy advocates and lawmakers, including Republicans whose districts could be affected by the cuts. The fate of the remaining $22 billion, which is mostly earmarked for Republican districts, remains unclear. An opinion on Charlie Kirk could be what keeps people in or out of America. The State Department announced Tuesday it has revoked at least six visas from foreign nationals after their recipients made comments about Kirk in the wake of the far-right youth leader’s assassination. So far, individuals from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Paraguay are affected. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the State Department wrote on X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Exactly what qualifies for expulsion is not clear, though some of the remarks were notably benign. An Argentine national who had their visa revoked said that Kirk spread “racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric”—all of which is demonstrably true. That language in particular has even been circulated by House lawmakers in criticizing Kirk’s point of view. In a string of social media posts, the official account for the State Department shared several examples of the comments that caught its attention from individuals “who are no longer welcome in the U.S.” The State Department claimed that nearly all of the examples suggested the commenters were attempting to justify Kirk’s death. “Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and he died by his own rules,” wrote the Paraguayan national. A German, writing in German, commented that “when fascists die, democrats don’t complain.” The State Department warned in an X post that “[President Donald Trump] and [Secretary Marco Rubio] will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws.” “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the department wrote. Vice President JD Vance late Tuesday decried “pearl clutching” over a Politico story unearthing a private group chat in which prominent members of Young Republicans chapters called Black people monkeys, spoke approvingly of rape and slavery, and wrote other odious remarks, such as “I love Hitler” and messages containing racial and homophobic slurs. Opting for whataboutism, Vance highlighted unearthed messages by Jay Jones, a Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, who recently apologized for leaked private messages from August 2022, in which he joked about shooting then-state House Speaker Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones also said Gilbert would not take action on gun safety unless his children were endangered, writing, “Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy.” Vance posted a screenshot of the latter comment on X, with the caption: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.” For one, it’s not a matter of fact that Jones’s messages are worse than those of the Young Republicans, who spoke about having their political opponents raped and sent to gas chambers. Vance is also trying to downplay the importance of the messages by claiming they were shared in a “college group chat.” But Young Republicans groups include those between 18 and 40 years old, with members of the reported group chat well into adulthood. The man Politico identifies as “the most prominent voice in the chat spreading racist messages,” for instance, is 31. The members held notable positions in Republican politics, with several leading state affiliates of the GOP’s youth arm. Some worked in state politics, and at least one serves as a state senator. Vance’s tweet exemplifies his time-tested willingness to excuse vitriol in his own ranks, embracing a “no-enemies-to-the-right” stance that is seemingly limitless.

Title: Intel laid me off — and I could see it coming. My third layoff in a decade has been the toughest to bounce back from.

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kent Ha, a 37-year-old job seeker in Portland, Oregon, who previously worked as a digital marketing strategist at Intel. He holds a bachelor's degree in new media communications from Oregon State University and an MBA from George Fox University with a concentration in leadership and management. He's looking for product marketing and digital experience roles. Business Insider has verified Ha's past employment with documentation. It has been edited for length and clarity. On July 9, I learned I'd been laid off by Intel. While I enjoyed my five years at the company, I didn't have the reaction some people describe — getting the news, breaking down, and cycling through emotions. Part of the reason is that I saw the layoff coming. In recent years, Intel has conducted thousands of layoffs, which made many of us worried about our job security. When our CEO left the company last December, we were worried that more cuts could be coming. My role fell under the company's sales and marketing group. In the months leading up to July, Intel had taken steps to outsource some of my team's work to another company. That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit. The other reason the layoff news didn't affect me too much was that I'd already been laid off twice by other companies since 2015 — once during a restructuring and again during the pandemic. By the time it happened a third time, my mindset had already shifted. I'd seen it coming, I knew what it was like to lose a job, and I was already looking for my next role. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Before I was laid off, I'd started focusing on building my skills in hopes of reducing the chances I'd be let go. But at the same time, I began monitoring the job market to assess the types of roles available. As the company's outlook worsened, I began browsing roles more actively, and it became clear that finding a new job could be challenging. By June, I believed there was a decent chance I'd be let go in the coming months, so I took two steps to prepare. The first was reaching out to my financial advisor. I told them a layoff seemed likely and that the job market looked tough. They advised me not to overreact to something that hadn't happened yet, but said that if I was let go, I should file for unemployment — and that my wife and I should cut back spending on things like eating out and vacations. The second step I took to prepare for the layoff was to start applying for jobs. I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan. Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes. It was a contingency plan — that's how I thought about it. As I began searching for jobs, with a focus on product marketing and digital experience positions, I found myself reflecting on the two previous times I'd been laid off. In 2015, I moved from Portland, Oregon, to San Diego for a new role. Six months later, I was let go due to company restructuring. After that layoff, it took me about two and a half months to secure my next role, a three-month contract position. Knowing there wouldn't be a chance for an extension, I kept searching — and was able to find a full-time job that started shortly after the contract ended. In 2020, I was working at a home improvement company that focused on in-home services. When the pandemic hit, those services came to a halt. To cut costs, the company laid off workers — and I was among them. I was fortunate to land a content manager contract role at Intel in less than a month. That role eventually led to a promotion into a full-time digital marketing strategist position, which I held until I was laid off this year. In both 2015 and 2020, I cold-applied to jobs — but what actually worked was posting my résumé on sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster. Staffing agencies would reach out, which led to interviews. Compared to my prior layoffs, this job search has been particularly challenging. I'm not having as much luck with those job boards, and when I do hear back, it's usually for entry-level roles. There also seems to be an increase in scams — for example, I recently got an email where the subject line said Audi was hiring, but the body of the message referenced the Marriott Hotel. My other strategies have included updating my résumé — with help from ChatGPT — to ensure it reflects the skill sets needed for the roles I'm targeting. I also strengthened my personal website, hoping to showcase my capabilities to potential employers. I've also reached out to my network to let them know I'm looking for work. I was fortunate to be part of a supportive team at Intel, and even now, many of us continue to share job leads and support each other. That's helped quite a bit. While these strategies have helped me get some interviews, I'm still struggling to land a job. The search has been an emotional roller coaster because there are roles that seem like a perfect fit, and then they go nowhere. I've been fortunate enough to secure some interviews, but it's really difficult to prepare for them and convey the right information within a short timeframe. As I go through my job search, I'm very grateful to my wife, who listens to me talk about companies day in and day out. Knowing how stressful it is for me, she's made us go on nightly walks to decompress. It's also been extremely helpful to have her income coming in — she works in the healthcare industry. I have a few pieces of advice for others who have been laid off: The first is related to your mindset. My first layoff in 2015 hit me hard — I'd just moved to California for the role, and six months later, I lost it. Over time, I realized it wasn't personal. Companies evolve, and so must you. That perspective helped me stay grounded during later layoffs, including this one. Second, find ways to grow. I noticed that one role I was interested in preferred a certified Scrum Product Owner certification, which I was already planning to pursue, so I took the course. I'm now planning to explore AI courses as well to stay current and competitive. And finally: Take a breath. As hard as this is, it might be the only time in your career when you can pause. I remind myself it's a marathon. Having a routine, staying sharp, and preparing for the next opportunity — that's what keeps me going.

Title: Did A Cyber School Giant Try To Hide Its Troubles By Attacking A Public School?

ByPeter Greene, Senior Contributor. Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. "Our students deserve better," said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release. "This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law." Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins." The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin." According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education." And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Elison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, "despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012." In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their "epic series of tech errors." K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners.

Title: Tech Workers Versus Enshittification
URL: http://cacm.acm.org/opinion/tech-workers-versus-enshittification/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T17:34:50Z
Full Content:
The men who appeared on the dais behind President Trump at his inauguration were never good men. Take Tim Cook. Cook owes his elevation to Apple CEO—which made him a billionaire twice over—to his leadership in moving Apple manufacturing to “iPhone City” in south China.3 Other Apple execs had tried this, but they could never get the precision and reliability Apple demanded. Cook managed it, but the brutal working conditions created by Foxconn, Apple’s contract manufacturer there, led to the installation of suicide nets5 to catch workers who leapt to their death rather than facing another shift. Or look at Jeff Bezos. Workers in Bezos’s warehouses are injured (often critically) at three times the rate of workers in other companies’ warehouses.7 Bezos’s contract drivers have to relieve themselves in bottles because they are not given toilet breaks. They are also monitored by AI cameras that score their eyeball movements.11 Google’s top bosses covered up for a senior manager who allegedly preyed on a female subordinate, whom he subjected to violent sex acts. He was given millions of dollars to go away quietly12 while his victim was prohibited from suing by the “binding arbitration” waivers in her contract. These men have always abused anyone they could get away with abusing. If they seemed to treat some people well—for example, the pampered coders who get gourmet cafeterias, free massages, and all the kombucha they can drink—it was because they feared the difficulties of replacing those workers. Now that U.S. Big Tech has shed more than 400,000 jobs in just two years, there’s a reserve army of desperate techies who can be given the suicide-net-and-urine-bottle treatment. One of the first official acts of the current administration was to cancel every single labor investigation and enforcement action in the entire country.8 The administration’s antitrust boss canceled investigations into predatory pricing (selling goods below cost to drive out competitors) and surveillance pricing (using commercial surveillance data to charge you more (for example, by increasing the price of your breakfast sandwich on payday) or pay you less (for example, offering nurses lower wages if they are known to have overdue credit card bills).10 Instead of helping workers and shoppers resist predatory assaults fueled and perpetrated by Big Tech, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission chair is focusing all his energies on a new snitch line where FTC employees can report “wokeism.”4 The men who run Big Tech have always wanted to “enshittify” their services—to shift as much as they can from users, workers, suppliers, and business customers to themselves. The forces that prevented that—militant, scarce workers; competitors; regulators; and rival technologies—were critically weakened and even eliminated over the past 40 years. Biden’s administration was the first in two generations to take fighting corporate abuses seriously.1 Is it any wonder that Big Tech were all in for his rival? Enshittification would be much, much worse if not for tech workers. Tech workers have historically enjoyed remarkable workplace status—not just the material perks, from dry cleaning to personal trainers, but also the power to tell their bosses to go to hell. When your skills are in such high demand that you can quit your job, walk across the street, and get a better one later that same day, your boss has a real incentive to make you feel like you are their social equal, empowered to say and do whatever feels technically right, or just, you know, show up for work with facial piercings, a green mohawk, and a black t-shirt from Defcon with writing on it that your boss doesn’t understand but still feels uncomfortable about. Tech workers may have given their bosses tsuris and demanded sky-high wages, but at least they were wildly productive. The per-worker revenue for successful tech companies is unfathomable—tens or even hundreds of times their wages and stock compensation packages.2 What’s more, many tech businesses had more work than they could hire skilled workers to perform, so bosses’ strategy focused on getting the workers they could hire to put in longer hours. That strategy has a name: “vocational awe,” a term coined by the librarian-theorist Fobazi Ettarh to describe the grueling hours endured by workers who believe in the social value of their work. Teachers, nurses, librarians—any profession whose practitioners are motivated by a sense of duty is a profession vulnerable to vocational awe. Tech companies have been widely derided for their grandiose mission statements, such as Google’s “organize all the world’s information and make it useful” or Facebook’s “making the world more open and connected.” But whether the management of these companies believed in these high-minded words, they were absolutely internalized by employees, who—despite their job security—worked every hour god sent, sleeping under their desks and missing their parents’ funerals to hit their bosses’ arbitrary deadlines. As a motivational tactic, vocational awe (or, as Elon Musk puts it, “being extremely hardcore”) works very well, but it fails very badly. It turns out that when you actually care about your job, and when your boss can’t replace you, and when you can get a new job whenever you want, it’s damned hard to convince you to wreck the things you built and harm your users, even if that will make your boss more money. For many years, tech workers have been the last line of defense between Internet users and tech bosses, bravely holding the line on enshittification. But once tech started to shed workers en masse—260,000 layoffs in 2023,6 another 160,000 in 20249—the power of workers was shattered. Scarcity can give workers power, but scarcity is temporary: Eventually, enough people train to work in your industry, or your boss figures out how to outsource your job to overseas workers with fewer protections and rights, and your power is shattered. No wonder tech bosses are so excited about AI coding tools, which promise to turn skilled programmers from creative problem-solvers to mere code reviewers for AI as it produces tech debt at scale. Code reviewers never tell their bosses to go to hell, and they are a lot easier to replace. Now that tech workers are as disposable as Amazon warehouse workers and drivers, as disposable as the factory workers in iPhone City, it’s only a matter of time until the job conditions are harmonized downward. Jeff Bezos doesn’t force his delivery drivers to relieve themselves in bottles because he hates delivery drivers. Jeff Bezos doesn’t allow his coders to use a restroom whenever they need to because he loves hackers. The factor that determines how Jeff Bezos treats workers is “What is the worst treatment those workers can be forced to accept?” Throughout the entire history of human civilization, there has only ever been one way to guarantee fair wages and decent conditions for workers: unions. Even non-union workers benefit from unions, because strong unions are the force that causes labor protection laws to be passed, which protect all workers. Tech workers have historically been monumentally uninterested in unionization, and it’s not hard to see why. Why go to all those meetings and pay those dues when you could tell your boss to go to hell on Tuesday and have a new job by Wednesday? That’s not the case anymore. It will likely never be the case again. Interest in tech unions is at an all-time high. Groups such as Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition are doing a land-office business, and copies of Ethan Marcotte’s You Deserve a Tech Union are flying off the shelves. Now is the time to get organized. Your boss has made it clear how you’d be treated if they had their way. They’re about to get it. Walking a picket line is a slog, to be sure, but picket lines beat piss bottles, hands down.

Title: Abu Dhabi Fund MGX Emerges As Key Player In Two Major Trump-Era Deals
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/10/15/mgx-abu-dhabi-tiktok-trump-usd1-binance-aligned-data-centers/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T17:24:27Z
Full Content:
ByZach Everson, Forbes Staff. MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi fund, has surfaced in two of the most scrutinized deals in Donald Trump’s second term—it’s reportedly set to take a stake in TikTok’s U.S. business and used a Trump-linked stablecoin for a $2 billion transaction that may have benefited the president’s family financially. The Abu Dhabi government created MGX in March 2024 as a technology investment company, tasked with “accelerat[ing] the development and adoption of AI and advanced technologies” through global partnerships, according to a launch announcement. MGX was launched by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, and G42, an artificial intelligence holding company, in which Microsoft has invested $1.5 billion. The fund targets semiconductors, infrastructure, software, tech-enabled services, life sciences and automation services, with past investments in OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Altera and Binance. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan chairs MGX’s board—he’s also the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ National Security Adviser and chair of G42’s board as well as those of four other companies. MGX’s CEO, Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, studied at MIT, worked in investment banking and previously oversaw private equity investments at Mubadala. Asked about the TikTok talks, MGX chief communications officer Noelle Camilleri told Forbes, “On TikTok, we don’t have anything to share at this time.” In April 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States over privacy and data concerns, effective January 2025. The ban was never enforced, and on Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order, “Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security,” that would allow the platform to remain available. The executive order paves the way for U.S. investors to take majority control, while the Chinese parent company ByteDance’s stake will drop to less than 20%. The new owners have not been confirmed but, citing unnamed sources, CNBC reported that MGX, Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake will be the main investors, owning a combined 45% of TikTok USA. Oracle and Silver Lake did not respond to inquiries. On Wednesday, MGX announced it was teaming with the Artificial Infrastructure Partnership and BlackRock to buy Aligned Data Centers in a deal that values the company, which has 50 facilities, at $40 billion. The TikTok deal is not the first time MGX has been tied to Trump’s administration. The day after his second inauguration, Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed by MGX, OpenAI, Oracle and Japan’s SoftBank. And earlier in September, MGX joined Silver Lake in buying a 51% stake in Altera, Intel’s programmable-chip unit. The U.S. government owns 9.9% of Intel, after taking the extraordinary step of purchasing an $8.9 billion stake as part of the Trump administration’s semiconductor strategy. Final terms of the TikTok restructuring are not publicly known, including how large a stake MGX may take and what governance rights it could secure. Another open question is whether MGX will use the Trump-linked USD1 in future deals. $100 billion: The amount MGX hopes to have under management within a few years, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. World Liberty Financial says it was “inspired by the vision of Donald J. Trump” and lists him as co-founder emeritus, alongside co-founders Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Barron Trump. According to the company’s website, an LLC affiliated with the Trump family owns about 38% of World Liberty Financial, which issues the USD1 stablecoin. Stablecoin issuers typically earn interest on the reserves backing their tokens, such as U.S. Treasurys and cash equivalents. In May, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff said MGX would use $2 billion worth of USD1 to invest in the crypto exchange Binance. That choice effectively placed $2 billion of reserves with USD1’s custodian, potentially increasing the interest income for World Liberty Financial’s owners. The transaction also helped lift USD1’s market cap, aiding its scale and visibility. As of 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, USD1’s $2.7 billion market cap made it the sixth-largest stablecoin, according to CoinGecko, a crypto analytics firm. Also, two weeks after Witkoff announced the deal, the Trump administration agreed to allow the UAE to buy advanced computer chips from U.S. companies, the New York Times reported. One company set to benefit from the deal: G42, a founding partner of MGX, which Tahnoon chairs. (Although that deal is delayed, with some administration officials concerned about G42’s involvement, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. G42 did not respond to Forbes’ inquiry.) An MGX spokesperson told Forbes that Binance asked to settle in cryptocurrency and both sides opted for a stablecoin to limit volatility. Binance’s said that while its client “did not control the payment method chosen by MGX,” it welcomed the use of a stablecoin. MGX said it evaluated stablecoins on business suitability, the jurisdiction and currency of the reserves, and compliance history, then chose USD1 because it is fully reserved in U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by an independent U.S. custodian and audited. MGX added that it did not invest in World Liberty Financial, paid no fees and doesn’t hold USD1 today. MGX said it weighed “compliance history” in picking USD1, but that claim doesn’t match the timeline: MGX announced its $2 billion Binance investment on March 12, and World Liberty Financial didn’t unveil USD1 until March 25—leaving little track record to assess. Another firm Tahnoon chairs, G42, already had owned a stake in ByteDance but divested it after in response to U.S. lawmakers concerns about his ties to China. In January 2024, a Republican-led House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged the Commerce Department to impose export controls on G42—an AI holding company that helped found MGX—after an investigation found G42 had ties to Huawei and other blacklisted Chinese companies. The probe also linked G42 affiliates to a scientist accused of stealing U.S. military-funded research from UCLA to establish a government lab in Beijing. The following month, G42 divested from Chinese companies—including what had been a $100 million stake in ByteDance, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the deal. In April, Microsoft announced its $1.5 billion investment in G42 and a partnership to accelerate AI in the UAE. After MGX’s use of USD1 became public, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., joined by 11 other Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., filed a resolution to enforce the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars presidents from “accept[ing] of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without Congress’ consent. Senate Republicans blocked the measure. Separately, Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to Binance and MGX, asking why they used USD1 instead of fiat or another cryptocurrency. Any responses have not been made public, and Binance’s attorney declined to share details on any response it sent beyond saying its client “conducted themselves entirely properly with regard to the MGX investment.” The senators also asked the Office of Government Ethics to weigh in, but it has not responded. “You probably don’t have to scratch very deep to find an instance where the president has received an enormous infusion of cash to his crypto coin from a CEO or foreign oligarch who is then asking for a favor from Donald Trump,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told MSNBC in May. Since 2008, MGX vice chair Khaldoon Al Mubarak also has chaired Manchester City Football Club. Forbes ranks the team no. 5 on its list of the world’s most valuable sports franchises, estimating it’s worth $5.3 billion.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The AI revolution is expensive, but a group of investors led by BlackRock aren’t shy to open their wallets. The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), founded late last year by BlackRock, NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX, bought Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. The deal, which also included BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), is aimed at funding next-generation cloud and AI computing infrastructure. Australia-based Macquarie Asset Management sold the equity. Founded in 2013, Aligned has emerged as a leader in the data center space with more than 5 gigawatts of current and planned capacity across 50 global campuses. Aligned’s portfolio is found across Northern Virginia (which include two hyperscale campuses in Sterling and Ashburn), Chicago, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Ohio, São Paulo, Brazil, Queretaro, Mexico and Santiago, Chile. The consortium — financially anchored by the Kuwait Investment Authority and Singapore’s state-owned Temasek Holdings — plans to accelerate that growth, though expansion details were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Aligned will stay headquartered in Dallas with CEO Andrew Schapp at the helm. “AI is reshaping every sector of the global economy,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “By combining Aligned’s scalable, adaptable platform with AIP’s capital and capabilities, we will build the infrastructure to support innovation at scale.” Aligned’s trajectory is emblematic of the sheer energy surrounding data center investment. The company earlier this year raised roughly $12 billion in capital, split between equity and debt, in one of the largest-ever private sector investments in a data center developer. Indeed, tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others are expected to spend some $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year alone, according to Morgan Stanley.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off: IBIT ETF Breaks $100 Billion Barrier

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to statements made on CNBC, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has topped $100 billion in assets under management less than two years after it launched. That figure marks one of the fastest rises for any ETF in recent memory. It also puts the world’s largest asset manager squarely at the center of institutional Bitcoin holdings. Based on reports, BlackRock holds 804,944 BTC. At current, lower market levels, that stash is worth close to $90 billion. When Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week, the same holding was worth more than $100 billion. BlackRock’s position represents 3.83% of Bitcoin’s total supply. For comparison, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) owns 640,250 BTC, or 3.048% of supply, according to available figures. Those numbers show how ownership of Bitcoin is shifting toward big financial firms as ETFs and other products bring new capital into crypto markets. Larry Fink told viewers the firm is moving faster into digital assets and that tokenization will be used for a wide range of investments, from property to bonds. BlackRock also manages an Ethereum portfolio valued at more than $17 billion. The company has launched tokenized money market vehicles, and one product called BUIDL has become the largest tokenized cash money market fund, according to the firm. With about $4 trillion reportedly sitting in digital wallets worldwide, BlackRock sees an opportunity to reach investors who prefer digital channels. Reports show IBIT’s rapid growth has changed the balance of large holders. Where corporate treasuries and early adopters once dominated ownership, institutional funds now control a rising share. That matters for liquidity and for how large inflows or outflows might affect the market when they happen. It also shifts some power over market behavior to managers who must answer to clients and regulators. Based on market updates, Bitcoin fell below $112,500 on Wednesday. Price action cooled after recent gains, with renewed headwinds including US-China trade tensions and a temporary US government shutdown contributing to weaker sentiment. Analysts say the next few weeks could offer buying chances as funding and perpetual markets calm. Institutional flows into ETFs like IBIT will be watched closely because they can tilt short-term demand. BlackRock’s move signals a larger reality: digital assets are now part of mainstream finance. Fink’s change in tone — from caution to active investment — reflects that shift. The presence of a major manager with hundreds of thousands of BTC and a growing set of tokenized offerings will influence how investors view crypto exposure.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 billion deal highlights the unstoppable AI data center gold rush, as CEO Larry Fink pushes back on AI bubble fears

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Today’s announcement that a group of investors led by BlackRock has agreed to buy Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal underscores the seemingly unstoppable flow of money into AI data centers—and comes as its CEO, Larry Fink, pushes back on AI bubble fears. The deal to buy Aligned, which is owned by Macquarie Asset Management, is being inked by the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP)—a coalition formed in September 2024 by BlackRock, its infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners, as well as Microsoft, Nvidia, and MGX, an AI investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI, and Temasek joined as additional participants. The AIP was formed to invest up to $30 billion of equity capital in AI, data centers, and energy; this is its first deal, which ranks as one of BlackRock’s largest infrastructure investments to date. If completed, it would be among the largest data center transactions on record, and regardless it underscores how Wall Street is racing to claim a stake in the AI boom. Fink has rejected the idea that AI infrastructure spending represents a dangerous bubble, arguing that massive data center build-outs are essential if the U.S. is to remain the global leader. “Well, there’s a bubble in investing,” he said on CNBC Squawk Box yesterday. “But are we inferring a bubble means a bad thing? There is certainly a skyrocketing amount of capital being put to work. If you put it in a framework of geopolitical positioning, we as a country need these investments if we’re going to be the leader in AI technology.” Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Plano, Texas, was founded in 2013 to build and operate data centers for hyperscalers and cloud-computing companies. It has data centers across the U.S.—including in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City—as well as in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile. The timing of the deal comes as Big Tech firms race to secure scarce land, power, and compute capacity—the foundational resources underpinning the AI race. For example, over the past few weeks, OpenAI has announced multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD in order to lock in the computing power the company needs. “We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” Altman told reporters during a media event at OpenAI and Oracle’s flagship 800-acre Stargate data center location in Abilene, Texas, last month, where he also announced the companies will build five massive new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. OpenAI is far from alone: Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals in the past two months with U.K.-based data center developer Nscale, including the announcement today of a new site in Texas that will have capacity of as much as 240 megawatts of power. Also today, Meta announced it would invest $1.5 billion in an AI data center in El Paso, Texas, that could scale to 1 gigawatt, making it one of the largest planned data center campuses in the U.S. The total numbers are staggering: On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. And McKinsey said U.S. data center demand, driven largely by AI, could triple by 2030, and require data centers to make nearly $7 trillion in investments to keep up. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The long list of proposed funds includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETFs, as well as funds giving amplified exposure to crypto-related stocks such as crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin treasury firms Strategy and Tesla. Typical ETFs give investors exposure to an asset—be it a security or commodity—via shares that track its price and trade on stock exchanges. A leveraged ETF holds debt to amplify its position. The idea is that returns for investors can be greater than the tracked asset, but losses can also be compounded—in this case, potentially by five times. Volatility Shares had already filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get crypto ETFs on the market with three times exposure to the daily returns of the asset. The company in March debuted two ETFs tracking Solana futures, including one with two times daily exposure to SOL. Leveraged crypto ETFs are already on the market: Miami, Florida-based Defiance ETF's MSTX gives investors access to a leveraged position in Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's stock (MSTR), amplifying gains—and losses—by 175%.

A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% in morning trading. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: Khosla Ventures And Cleveland Clinic Partner On Healthcare Tech
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2025/10/15/khosla-ventures-and-cleveland-clinic-partner-on-healthcare-tech/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T16:00:22Z

ByAmy Feldman, Forbes Staff andAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at the Khosla Ventures-Cleveland Clinic partnership, Town Hall Ventures’ $440 million haul, the CDC’s “Friday night massacre,” Boehringer’s new pulmonary fibrosis drug, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. New technologies are transforming the way that hospitals operate. To try and gain an edge, Khosla Ventures and Cleveland Clinic signed a deal in which the health system will test new technologies that span AI, digital health and next-generation therapeutics from the VC firm’s portfolio companies—and the two will explore opportunities to incubate new companies together. “I think this is a novel approach,” Hal Paz, Khosla Ventures’ operating partner, told Forbes. Discussions that led to the agreement, announced at Cleveland Clinic’s Life Sciences Summit in London on Tuesday, had been in the works for a year. The storied VC firm, with $17 billion in assets under management and more than 300 portfolio companies (about one-third of them in healthcare), gains a substantial healthcare partner with whom to test new technologies from clinical validation through adoption, that may also become a valuable customer for the companies it’s invested in. Meanwhile, Cleveland Clinic, the highly-regarded non-profit health system that spans 23 hospitals and 280 outpatient facilities, gets access to a pipeline of emerging technologies that could help it improve care and efficiency. Already, some 10 to 12 of Khosla’s portfolio companies, mostly in AI and digital health, are in discussions with Cleveland Clinic about how they could work with the health system, Paz said. One, Vista AI, which has developed AI to automate and simplify cardiac MRIs, is already working with Cleveland Clinic at its Akron hospital. Vista’s software enables more scans to be done on a single machine with improved quality and consistency. The two are also already working on a first startup incubation, though neither the final idea nor the timing of its launch has been set. “We are at an inflection point in the industry,” said JD Friedland, Cleveland Clinic’s executive director of venture. “New transformational technologies are emerging that we believe are going to fundamentally address some of the perpetual challenges in healthcare.” The agreement comes as tech-based venture firms have increasingly viewed healthcare as an area of opportunity and as hospitals and health systems have been testing how technology could improve patient care, reduce physician burnout and increase razor-thin margins. It also follows a move by General Catalyst to acquire health system Summa Health, a $515 million deal that created the first hospital system to be owned by a VC firm. “I bet the more significant venture investors in healthcare are going to find different ways to get access to that clinical and research expertise,” Cleveland Clinic’s Friedland said. “It certainly costs a lot less money to partner with Cleveland Clinic than to buy a hospital, and it comes with less strings attached and less brain damage.” For both Khosla and Cleveland Clinic, their non-exclusive partnership could be the first of multiple collaborations—but both Paz and Friedland stressed there was much to do first. Said Paz: “Before we get over our skis and think about the second health system to partner with and the third, we need to give this a little time and learn from it.” When Andy Slavitt left government, he wanted to prove that you could use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities—and still make a profit. The former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and overseer of the successful turnaround of healthcare.gov, set up healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures in the summer of 2018 to do just that. “I’ve got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,” he told Forbes. “If [investors] think you are impact, they’ll put you in this bucket—people who do nice things and maybe some nice family office wants to invest in you because they’ve got an impact mandate. I have always resisted that.” Since its launch seven years ago, Town Hall Ventures has invested in 35 companies and started seven others, including kidney care specialist Strive and Suvida, which offers primary care focused on Hispanic seniors and their families. Its first fund posted top-decile performance, with a net internal rate of return from its July 2018 inception (thru June 30) of 33% versus 12% for the median VC fund. A total of 10 its bets surpassed a billion-dollar valuation, including Cityblock Health, a healthcare provider focused on low-income communities that was one of its initial investments and has since reached a valuation of $6.2 billion; SignifyHealth, a provider of tech-enabled at-home risk assessment acquired by CVS for $8 billion in 2023; and Landmark Health, a startup offering in-home medical care to patients with chronic conditions purchased by Optum Health for $3.5 billion in 2021. Buoyed by that track record, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has now raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. While the New York-based firm, whose general partners consist of Slavitt, David Whelan and Meera Mani, remains small compared to venture capital giants like Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst or Sequoia, each of which has tens of billions in assets under management, it’s a well-regarded player in healthcare.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease in which scarring on the lungs makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. Martin Beck, head of Boehringer’s inflammation disease area, told trade publication Fierce Pharma that the drug represented a major shift forward in treating a disease that had been a “graveyard of clinical development” with more than 36 failed trials over the past decade. Jascayd blocks a type of enzyme, called PDE4B, that’s involved in the honeycomb-patterned lung scarring and inflammation associated with the disease. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that it slowed patients’ decline in lung function compared to a placebo over the course of a year. Plus: Obesity startup Kailera Therapeutics raised $600 million, led by Bain Capital Private Equity, to start Phase III trials of its lead drug candidate, an injectable GLP-1 drug similar to Lilly’s Zepbound. The size of the round ties it with Isomorphic Labs for the largest biotech fundraise of the year. Forbes profiled Kailera earlier this year. Kailera was worth $1.5 billion before the new funding; its new valuation was not disclosed. Duos, a digital health company focused on seniors, raised $130 million, led by FTV Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The two-year-old company helps members enroll in government programs, retain Medicaid coverage and figure out benefits they may be eligible for but aren’t using. Plus: Umar Afridi, a pharmacist who previously cofounded Truepill, raised $20 million to bring AI to pharmacy operations with Foundation Health. Truepill was acquired by LetsGetChecked for $525 million last year. Digital Health-focused VC firm Define Ventures led the funding round. Biotech startup Immusoft safely re-dosed a patient with its experimental gene therapy for progressive genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type I that causes skeletal abnormalities, heart disease and vision loss. The company’s gene therapy makes use of engineered B-cells, which the body typically uses to make antibodies, to make specific proteins that treat diseases instead. The benefit of the approach is that it doesn’t require immunosuppression or chemotherapy as other gene therapies do. The ability to safely re-dose makes the therapy more long-lasting, which had been a question during its clinical trial. Forbes spoke with CEO Sean Ainsworth about the company’s technology earlier this year. Plus: Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its orthopedics business, which generated $9.2 billion in revenue in 2024. The new company, called DePuy Synthes, is expected to launch in 2027. Last Friday, around 1,300 CDC employees received notices that they’d been laid off with no warning. Over the weekend, more than half appear to have been told their firing was rescinded, though some 600 employees still appear to remain fired, according to the National Public Health Coalition, an organization of former CDC employees. So far, many of the departments hit appear to be core to the agency’s work, including the CDC library, which provides access to crucial scientific data for agency scientists; the agency’s entire Washington office, which provides information and support to Congress, the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and staff focused on data collection and disease surveillance. The Health and Human Services Department blamed the layoffs on the current government shutdown and said that employees laid off had been declared non-essential. This is one of several waves of layoffs that have eliminated around 25% of the CDC’s staff since Trump took office. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the Trump Administration, challenging the legality of layoffs during a government shutdown. In a lawsuit over a previous round of layoffs, a federal judge found that the Administration’s firing of CDC staff was likely unlawful. “Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump Administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” John Brooks, former chief medical officer for CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, told reporters at an National Public Health Coalition press conference on Tuesday. In response these ongoing program cuts, the Wall Street Journal reported today that 15 states, all with Democratic governors, are building an alliance to manage public health threats. The states have agreed that they will “help one another prepare for pandemics, track infectious diseases, write public-health guidelines, share expertise on preventive care and buy vaccines and supplies in bulk.” Novo Nordisk agreed to acquire Akero Therapeutics for up to $5.2 billion for its experimental liver disease treatment. San Francisco-based Akero has been testing its drug, efruxifermin, as a treatment for MASH, which causes fat to build up on the liver, leading to fibrosis. The deal follows Roche’s announcement last month that it was buying 89bio for $3.5 billion for its experimental MASH drug. Amazon sellers made millions from banned “Dechoker” medical devices, according to the FDA. Biotech dealmaking, from M&A to venture investments, ticked up in the third quarter. Political pressures are influencing work at FDA, according to career staffers there. Consumer Reports found that some protein shakes and powders contain extremely high levels of lead. Mixtures of common drugs that wind up in waterways may accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria, according to research led by the University of Exeter. Wearable health company Oura raised $900 million led by Fidelity, bringing its valuation to $11 billion. That’s more than double the $5.2 billion it was worth last December. The United Nations World Food Programme warned that nearly 14 million people faced severe hunger due to cuts in global aid, especially from the Trump Administration.

Title: What Chipmaking Equipment Giant ASML's Q3 Results Said About AI Demand, China Trade

Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to “decline significantly,” thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen “continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.” U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world’s leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.

Amazon is reportedly planning significant layoffs, targeting about 15% of its human resources staff and potentially impacting other departments. This move aligns with the tech giant's strategy to invest heavily in artificial intelligence while reducing employee costs. CEO Andy Jassy has previously indicated that AI adoption will lead to workforce reductions as the company seeks efficiency gains.

Title: The Protocol: Monad Airdrop Portal Opens as Token Launch Nears

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: MONAD AIRDROP COMES CLOSER AS PORTAL OPENS: Monad is gearing up for one of the most anticipated token launches of the year. The Layer-1 blockchain project has opened its MON airdrop portal, inviting eligible users to check their status ahead of the official token distribution. While the airdrop itself hasn’t gone live yet, the Monad Foundation said that users can now verify eligibility and connect their wallets, with the window remaining open until Nov. 3, 2025. “There is NO incentive to claiming really fast, so take your time. Triple check everything,” said Keone Hon, the co-founder of Monad, on X. The Monad Foundation shared in a blog post that it will target around 5,500 core community members and 225,000 broader crypto users, rewarding those who’ve helped grow the Monad ecosystem. Distribution will be done through a multi-track system spanning five categories: Monad Community, Onchain Users, Crypto Community, Crypto Contributors & Curious and Monad Builders. Those who qualify across multiple tracks can stack their allocations, giving more weight to active participants. The team also said it will be combining on-chain activity data (such as DEX volume and NFT ownership) with off-chain verification through platforms like Twitter, Discord and Telegram. The airdrop marks a step toward Monad’s upcoming mainnet launch, though the details of when that will happen and the number of tokens allocated towards these communities are still unknown. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. FUSAKA GOES LIVE ON ETHEREUM’S SEPOLIA TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched the second test of the upcoming Fusaka upgrade earlier this week on the Sepolia network, marking another step toward the upgrade’s mainnet debut. The test follows a successful rollout on the Holesky testnet two weeks ago. Developers plan one final rehearsal on the Hoodi network on Oct. 28, after which they’ll set a date to activate Fusaka on Ethereum’s main blockchain. Coming only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade, Fusaka is designed to lower costs for institutions using the network. One of its key features, PeerDAS, allows validators to verify only portions of data rather than entire “blobs.” This improvement reduces bandwidth demands and helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Testnets like Sepolia play a crucial role in Ethereum’s development cycle, giving developers a reliable environment to test upgrades under real-world conditions before they go live on the main network. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. MONERO RELEASES PRIVACY BOOST AGAINST SNEAKY NETWORK NODES: Leading privacy blockchain Monero has released an important upgrade that significantly strengthens user protection against spy nodes. The blockchain announced CLI v0.18.4.3 'Fluorine Fermi' on X, calling it a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes. Monero relies on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network where nodes (computers) connect directly to each other to share and verify transactions and blocks. Privacy is ensured through several key technologies: each transaction uses unique stealth addresses so that the recipient’s actual address stays hidden; ring signatures mix a sender’s transaction with other decoy transactions, making it unclear who really sent the funds; and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) hide the amount being transferred. Still, a paper published on the research sharing platform arXiv in September noted the growing presence of non-standard nodes in the network. These nodes pose as honest nodes but are likely intended for monitoring the network and spying on other nodes, thereby endangering privacy. The Fluorine Fermi update tackles this challenge by implementing an improved peer selection algorithm that reduces the chance users connect to multiple nodes within the same IP subnet, a common spy node tactic. It discourages connections to large clusters of suspicious IP addresses, steering users toward safer nodes. — Omkar Godbole Read more. EF MAKES PRIVACY A PILLAR OF ITS WORK: The Ethereum Foundation is making privacy a formal pillar of its roadmap, expanding research efforts into a dedicated cluster that now covers private payments, proofs, identity, and enterprise use cases. Ethereum has supported privacy research through its Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team since 2018, with experiments like Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail and zkTLS, and the Anon Aadhaar project. These have become reference points for developers across the ecosystem, spawning hundreds of forks and integrations. The new “privacy cluster,” coordinated by Igor Barinov, brings these experiments under a single umbrella alongside new initiatives, per a blog post. Those include private reads and writes for payments and interactions, portable proofs for identity and asset ownership, zkID systems for selective disclosure, UX work to normalize privacy tools, and Kohaku, an SDK and wallet designed to make strong cryptography usable by default. An Institutional Privacy Task Force is also part of the cluster, translating compliance and operational requirements into specifications that larger enterprises can test. The Foundation framed privacy as essential to Ethereum’s credibility. Blockchains are transparent by design, but widespread adoption requires that users and institutions have the option to transact, govern, and build without exposing sensitive data. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

"Five years from now, there's not going to be a stock, there's not going to be an option, there's not going to be a mutual fund, ETF, anything that's not in effect tokenized," Moglia told CNBC on Tuesday, describing traditional finance professionals as still struggling to grasp the shift happening in Web3 and DeFi markets. “Going forward, real-world assets are going to be tokenized as the rest of the world is going to be,” he added, while adding he’s pursuing tokenization of its reinsurance company's risk as part of its strategy. His comments come as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appeared on 60 Minutes advocating crypto ownership after previously dismissing Bitcoin in 2017 as an "index of money laundering,” a shift Moglia attributes to Fink becoming "a DeFi guy" who "appreciates the future." BlackRock is developing proprietary tokenization technology and "having conversations with all the major platforms" about digital wallet integration, according to Fink's recent earnings call. "We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries," Fink said, pointing to real estate, where tokenization could reduce fees and make home ownership more affordable by cutting out layers of middlemen. Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt that tokenization will now "work its way up that risk curve" toward less liquid assets. "I truly believe ultimately we will have almost every financial asset in a tokenized version because it just helps to automate the value chain, starting from issuance over the primary market, secondary market, the legal anchor, corporate actions, all of this. Musheer Ahmed, Founder & MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt, "while there is significant momentum for tokenization of financial products and I am also bullish on the use case, this timeline of 5 years to tokenize everything is highly optimistic." Ahmed noted that the timeline is plausible even as “most trading rails and infra will take many years” and that “the tokenization wave is led by the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE,” while most markets still “lack frameworks for digital assets.” The low trading volume in tokenized assets stems from “the nature of the underlying assets,” he said, noting “most RWAs are not liquid or in high demand for daily turnover.” “Current tokenized products (outside of bonds) are not being actively marketed by brokers, private banks, or investment funds,” he said, and that once they are offered more widely, “demand will pick up and help create a more dynamic secondary market.” Total real-world assets on-chain have reached $33.91 billion, up 6.6% from 30 days ago, with 483,892 total asset holders, according to RWA.xyz data.

Title: CAIS Summit Underscores the Growing Adoption of Alts in Wealth Space

The alternative investment platform’s fourth annual conference highlighted how far advisors have come in moving into private markets. October 15, 2025 Asset managers and advisors converged in Los Angeles this week for the fourth annual CAIS Summit—a conference that brings together many of the alternative investment platform’s users. It also serves as a useful barometer for the ongoing trend of increased adoption of private markets in the wealth space. Attendance at the show has grown from a few hundred at its inaugural event to over 1,200 at this year’s show. Of that, CAIS reported 325 wealth management firms, and 800 advisors are attending the event. (In all, CAIS said that 2,000 wealth firms and 62,000 advisors currently use its platform.) On the asset management side, most of the major alts managers increasingly targeting the wealth space are also represented, including names like Apollo, Ares, Blackrock, Blackstone, Blue Owl, Brookfield Oaktree, Carlyle, Coller Capital, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, JP Morgan, KKR, Partners Group, T. Rowe Price and others. In reflecting on the evolution of the space since launching CAIS about 15 years ago, CAIS CEO and founder Matt Brown pointed to the rush by firms that historically served institutional investors to gain traction in the private wealth space. “The alternative asset management community really cares about wealth management,” Brown said. “That hasn’t always been the case. By the way, that’s a huge positive for the advisor community. Alts managers see an opportunity to grow their businesses, and advisors are no longer an afterthought. [Asset managers] are collaborating, designing products, rolling out education and building teams to service you. They are all in. My recommendation is to take advantage.” Related:Blackstone Creates Business Group to Bolster 401(k) Strategy Several major trends were apparent throughout the first full day of the conference, including the coalescence around evergreen funds (interval funds, tender offer funds, BDCs and non-traded REITs) as the preferred vehicle for delivering private markets to the wealth channel. Today, there are more than 400 registered funds available with alts exposure, and about half of those have been launched in the last 24 months. (A recent report from consulting firm Deloitte projected that over the next five years, semiliquid funds’ global AUM could grow 12-fold to $4.1 trillion.) In addition, the convergence of public and private markets, marked by a surge in mergers and partnerships among traditional and alternative asset managers, was a significant theme. Several products (some as model portfolios, others as semiliquid funds) have already come to market with more on the way. Related:Envestnet, Orion, Vestmark Expand Integrations with CAIS For its part, CAIS has launched a models marketplace that is selectively adding managers and strategies. “With the use of models, it goes from manager selection to outcomes,” said CAIS Advisors Chief Investment Officer Neil Blundell. (CAIS Advisors was created last year to assist financial advisors with streamlining portfolio construction.) “It’s a big strategic shift. It’s a lot easier to say, ‘Are you looking for enhanced income? Diversification? Growth? Etc.’ Models are designed with strategic asset allocations in a fashion that can deliver that outcome.” Lastly, unsurprisingly, AI was a significant theme, both as an investment opportunity gained via exposure to private market stakes in AI firms and data center and energy infrastructure, and in terms of its application in the space. (For its part, CAIS showcased AI that will soon be integrated into its platform, named CAIS.ey.) The state of private credit was also a hot button topic, especially amid the announced bankruptcies of U.S. auto parts supplier First Brands and car dealership Tricolor and recent comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during the bank’s third quarter conference call. “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Dimon said during the call. Related:Former Envestnet CEO Bill Crager Joins Private Markets Startup Private credit managers bristled at those remarks and pointed to the fact that private credit has withstood several business cycles with low loss rates. They also pointed to the importance of due diligence, underwriting and sponsor quality. “Credit quality is reasonably good,” said Glenn R. August, founder and CEO of Oak Hill Advisors. “We are not leveraging these investments 10 times with mark-to-market financing. ... We learned in 2008 that marked-to-market financing doesn’t work.” In a separate session, Ken Kencel, President and CEO of Churchill Asset Management, pointed to his firm’s average loss rate of five basis points per year on private credit as a sign of stability in the asset class. “We welcome the scrutiny because we know we’ve proven ourselves over 20 years,” Kencel said. “The best managers have a longstanding track record you can look to support performance and values.” He added that focusing on less volatile sectors—for example, it doesn’t do loans to energy companies, restaurants or retailers—as a major part of the firm’s strategy to avoid risk. “Our belief is individual investors in particular are looking for excellent risk-adjusted returns,” he said. “They are not looking for managers chasing an extra 50 basis points. They know that chasing leads to taking on more risk.” He also pointed to the significant number of deals the firms passes on financing. “There are top borrowers that you want to finance,” he said. “And then there are deals you turn down. In our case, those are deals that are cyclical and higher risk. It’s not about chasing yield. It’s about financing the best businesses. That’s where you want your direct lending partner to be.” Comments at the conference also touched on the state of the macroeconomy and regulatory environment. Despite the increased volatility in markets largely stemming from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, speakers retained a bullish outlook on the economy. Many pointed to how markets rebounded after a sharp drop in April from Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, and in subsequent months, reactions to shifting policy have been more muted. “What I look for is not what politicians say, but what businesses need and what consumers are demanding. That leads to a series of trends that policymakers usually back,” said Ken Mehlman, partner, global head of public policy and affairs at KKR. (Mehlman previously served stints as chair of the Republican National Committee from 2005 to 2007 and as White House director of public affairs for two years during President George W. Bush’s administration.) “Is there a risk that because of policy change and political change, it could be disrupted? Yes,” he said. However, he underscored that focusing on trends that transcend who is in power is a way of limiting policy risk. On the regulatory front, panelists welcomed the lighter touch from government agencies and expected that to continue, potentially expanding access to private markets to more investors. In concert with the conference, CAIS announced expanded integrations with several TAMPs (Orion, Envestnet and Vestmark) and managed account platforms. It also announced a partnership with secondary market specialist LODAS Markets. LODAS Markets enables investors in private vehicles such as non-traded REITs, interval funds and other structures, an option outside those funds’ dedicated redemption windows to sell shares. Through the partnership, LODAS secondary trading tech will be integrated into the CAIS platform. The functionality is expected to go live in the first quarter of next year.

Title: AI Won’t Replace Jobs, but Tech Bros Want You to Be Afraid It Will

Time Published: 2025-10-15T14:20:54Z

reading time 5 minutes AI is overrated, according to author Cory Doctorow. “I don’t think AI can do your job,” Doctorow said, but despite that, bosses across industries are “insatiably horny” about the idea that AI will replace jobs. Top of the list is tech bosses. Tech is one of the industries where AI is scaling significantly faster in the workforce than average (the bigger picture corporate AI adoption is much slower, and some studies claim the returns on investments are low). Many tech CEOs have made statements expressing their wishes to automate tasks that would have regularly gone to human workers. A new report by Source, a consulting firm that works with the tech industry, claimed that over half of tech companies are considering restructuring because of AI. “Tech bosses love the story of AI replacing programmers,” Doctorow said at an event hosted by the Brooklyn Public Library last week, where he was answering former FTC chair Lina Khan’s questions. During her tenure in the Biden administration, Khan was known for her firm regulatory stance against big tech monopolies. Computer programming was once the most lucrative industry to go into, with a surplus of demand for workers; there were numerous job opportunities with great pay and benefits, and cushy amenities. Now, the script has completely switched. Many have blamed the rise of generative AI for it. But Doctorow argues “that’s just not a thing AI is doing” or even can do. “AI can write sub-routines, it can’t do software architecture. Can’t do engineering, because engineering is about having a long, broad context window to understand all the pieces that came before, all the pieces that are coming in the future, and the pieces that sit adjacent to code, and if you know anything about AI, the one thing that is most expensive to do with AI is expanding the context window,” Doctorow said. Doctorow is famous for having coined the term “enshittification” to describe the common, modern-day phenomenon of almost every tech platform becoming soulless, dysfunctional and widely-hated corpses that internet users are still trapped under.Â It’s a cathartically profane critique of capitalism in the tech age that Macquaire Dictionary picked as its word of the year in 2024. He argues that what tech bosses actually like is to have tech workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” To understand why, you need to look into how the dynamic has changed in the tech workplace in the past two decades. “The way that tech bosses motivated tech workers was appealing to their sense of mission,” Doctorow said. It was a double-edged sword: it both motivated the tech workers to work grueling hours, but it also made them passionate about the product and its purpose. So, if the boss decided to make changes at the expense of that vision of greater good and in the pursuit of greater margins, the workers tended to fight for the user. One example of that was the Google employee protests over the controversial military AI initiative Project Maven, which successfully saw the tech giant walk back its involvement. Back then, Doctorow argues, tech workers were a good way to keep the industry in check because they had a sense of purpose and they had power. Demand for workers far exceeded the supply, so if things were going awry in the company’s progress towards its mission, they could threaten to leave. There were many other opportunities that they could switch to. But things have since changed, and supply has caught up with demand. Roughly 400,000 tech employees have been laid off in the past two years alone. Silicon Valley companies are asking their employees to work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a schedule known as “996” that was popularized in China. Meanwhile, big tech companies are spending big and making record profits. Nvidia just became the first and only company to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. The power dynamic has now switched, and the power is with the bosses. And this time around, according to Doctorow, they want to make sure that the power dynamic stays that way. “Tech bosses have shown us how they treat workers they’re not afraid of,” Doctorow said, pointing the finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Federal injury data from 2022 found that Amazon warehouse workers were seriously injured at more than twice the rate at other warehouses. A subsequent Senate probe from 2024 concluded that Amazon had been manipulating its self-reported injury data to make its warehouses appear safer. “The minute Jeff Bezos can put a piss jar next to your workstation, he will,” Doctorow said. “At this point, when Google is firing 12,000 workers, and then doing a $70 billion stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the next 27 years, you need a union,” he advised. If Doctorow’s estimates are true, then AI won’t take over any jobs. But then what about the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the AI industry, so much so that those investments are almost entirely driving American economic growth? “The great kind of tragedy and terror of all of this is that AI, if it can’t do your job, then whatever benefits we get from it are not commensurate with the capital expenditures that we’ve made for it, nor will they be sufficiently profitable to incur the operational expenses associated with maintaining these large foundation models,” Doctorow said. TLDR on that: He thinks there is an AI bubble. And he is not alone in thinking like this; many other experts have been sounding the alarms of a rapidly growing AI bubble. In a notable addition this week, the United Kingdom’s central bank said that “equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” and that this could lead to a sudden, sharp correction. The Bank said that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five are the AI-heavy big tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Lina Khan painted a picture of some other reasons why experts believe there is an AI bubble at the event on Thursday. “There have been increasing discussion about how we may actually be just seeing a big AI bubble,” the former FTC chair said. “We’re seeing all of these circular investments where it’s like the same five to seven companies just handing each other big bags of cash, saying, IOU, we’re seeing, you know, increasing reporting in the business press that even though we’re seeing such significant investment in AI, increasingly, firms are being candid that they don’t know what the profitable use case is going to be, but are just kind of afraid of missing out.” In her time in office, Khan’s FTC opened inquiries into the various deals and partnerships between big tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and the then-rising, now-reigning AI labs OpenAI and Anthropic. A bubble is worrying. A pop is even more worrisome. “I think we’re going to see a collapse, and it’s going to be very bad,” Doctorow said. “I think 2008 is going to look like a golden age when AI pops.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Apple has topped Interbrand’s annual Best Global Brands ranking for the 13th consecutive year—but AI giant Nvidia is closing in on its crown. Interbrand’s list ranks 100 companies based on their financial performance, the role their brand plays in purchase intent, and the brand’s competitive strength. The total value of this year’s Best Global Brands stands at $3.6 trillion, a 4.4% increase versus last year. 2025’s top five brands remained unchanged from 2024, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Samsung following Apple’s lead. However, further down the list, there’s been a historic surge for Nvidia and 12 new entrants across tech, finance, retail, and more, underlining shifting market dynamics. AI chipmaker Nvidia recorded the largest-ever brand value increase in Best Global Brands’ history, rising by 116% to reach $43.2bn—catapulting it from 36th place in 2024 to 15th in 2025. “Nvidia’s stellar product marketing and complete dominance in its ecosystem have spurred its meteoric rise,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand. However, he cautioned that the Silicon Valley company (which was founded in 1993, but has recently surged in prominence as its hardware drives the AI boom) shouldn’t get too comfortable. “The emergence of a disruptor could undo this brand if it does not invest in long-term brand storytelling,” Silverman said. “It has the scale, but that’s not a brand strategy. To maintain sustainable growth, this is imperative.” Despite their recent advertising blitzes, consumer-facing AI brands like OpenAI and Anthropic did not make this year’s list. Notable new entries included investment firm BlackRock, which landed at number 31, Booking.com (32), and Uniqlo (47). Instagram’s brand value grew 27%, leading it too enter the top 10 for the first time, too. When it came to brand tumbles, Nike—which is transforming to regain its marketing edge—dropped from the 14th to the 23rd spot after losing 26% of its value. Elon Musk’s Tesla also dropped 13 spots to 25th place, with a 35% decline in brand value. Interbrand’s Best Global Brands 2025 – Top 10 1. Apple 2. Microsoft 3. Amazon 4. Google 5. Samsung 6.

Amazon plans layoffs: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% job roles in its human resources department, along with certain other roles, Fortune reported on Wednesday, 15 October 2025. According to the news portal's report, Amazon's HR department, also known as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, will bear the majority of the cuts, while other departments, such as the consumer business, may also experience some impact. Amazon's HR department has more than 10,000 people employed globally. The company is reportedly laying off staff as the e-commerce giant aims to reduce its employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure. Big IT companies such as TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are among other firms that have carried out restructuring to improve efficiency and reduce costs amid the rise of AI. TCS is cutting nearly 12,000 employees, or around 2% of its global workforce, in the financial year 2025-26, amid restructuring plans and a push for AI expansion. In the case of Wipro, although there is no official confirmation of layoffs, media reports suggest that the IT major has cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Global IT services giant Accenture announced in September 2025 that it would lay off more than 11,000 employees across its global workforce, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over. Salesforce reportedly reduced its customer support workforce to 5,000 employees, down from its earlier 9,000 employees, marking a reduction of approximately 4,000 employees. 1. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) — Laid off 6,000 employees or 1% of its headcount. It will lay off another 6,000 employees to cut a total of 12,000 jobs or 2% of its total workforce. 2. Google — Laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 3. Accenture — To lay off 11,000 employees across its global workforce. 4. Salesforce — Cut nearly 4,000 customer support staff. 5. Microsoft — Cut more than 40% or nearly 4,000 jobs in its software engineering business. 6. IBM — Cut nearly 1,000 job roles as the firm shifted to its hybrid cloud and AI business. 7. Cognizant — Laid off 3,500 employees in an effort to simplify the organisation's structure. 8. Wipro — Cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Many tech companies around the world are facing challenges due to pressure from their US business and recent concerns about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in the H-1B visa fee. Jobs are at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to boost productivity and efficiency over that of the human workforce.

Title: How LLY Stock Delivered $47 Billion To Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/how-lly-stock-delivered-47-billion-to-shareholders/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets. Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history. The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels. Eli Lilly’s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion. Let’s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management’s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that’s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That’s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let’s examine Eli Lilly’s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That’s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That’s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers—balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn’t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events—the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic—it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility—a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Do you already hold Nvidia stock? You may want to think about retaining it. Are you planning to buy in? This could be your opportunity. Nvidia has emerged the most important semiconductor player in the AI space, driven by its advanced GPU architectures that form the backbone of AI training and inference workloads across industries. The stock has surged 30% this year, and remains up about 90% from its April 2025 lows. Reflect on the following information. While we prefer to buy dips if the fundamentals are strong — for NVDA, see Buy or Sell NVDA Stock — we remain cautious about falling knives. Particularly, it’s essential to determine whether, if conditions worsen and NVDA declines another 20-30% to $126 levels, we could maintain our position in the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Interestingly, the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during several economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and (b) the speed of its recovery. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor. Here are the specifics, but first, as a brief background: NVDA offers graphics, compute, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, in strategic partnership with Kroger Co. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction 2008 Global Financial Crisis Concerned that NVDA may drop significantly further?

Title: Still not ready for Black Friday 2025? Here is your last minute rescue plan

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Heads up! Black Friday is almost here, and if you still haven’t prepared, it’s time to act fast. The clock is ticking, but you can still make meaningful updates that count. This article covers practical and straightforward last minute Black Friday tips to help you make quick, effective changes to your eCommerce store. Even with just a few days left, there’s still room to attract customers and make the most of the biggest shopping event of the year. Did you know? Numbers show that Black Friday 2024 broke all records, as U.S. shoppers spent a staggering $ 10.8 billion online, representing a 10.2 percent increase from 2023. These numbers prove one thing: it is never too late to take action and grab your share of the Black Friday rush. The fastest way to put your Black Friday campaign on pilot mode is by focusing on a few essentials that make an immediate difference. These must-do, last minute Black Friday tips are your quick wins, helping you cover the basics, build momentum, and set up the foundation for a successful marketing campaign. When shoppers land on your website, your Black Friday deals should be impossible to miss. Highlight your best offers right on the homepage or add a static banner so visitors see them immediately. The clearer your offers are, the easier it is for customers to take action. One of the most innovative ways to increase engagement is by using countdown timers. They build urgency, encourage faster decisions, and make shoppers feel like they’re part of something time-sensitive. The Diamond Store saw this in action when they added a live countdown clock to their 24-hour Black Friday email campaign. The result? A 400% higher conversion rate compared to their previous emails. For WordPress users, OptinMonster is a quick way to get started. It lets you create dynamic floating bars and banners with countdowns, all through a simple drag-and-drop builder. If you’re using Shopify, the Essential Countdown Timer Bar app works perfectly for creating announcement bars or cart countdowns to drive urgency and prevent cart abandonment. Did you know a long or confusing checkout process is one of the biggest reasons shoppers abandon their carts, especially during high-traffic days like Black Friday? That’s the last thing you want when every second counts. Before the rush begins, take a few minutes to go through your own checkout process on both desktop and mobile. Place a test order just like a customer would. Verify that your discount codes are applied correctly, your payment options load smoothly, and the overall flow feels quick and effortless. Read more: Boost your checkout page UX: Vital tips for online stores Ask a few friends, family members, or even teammates to try it too. Fresh eyes often spot friction points you might miss, such as unclear buttons, confusing forms, or slow-loading pages. Trust also plays a huge role. Ensure your checkout page displays secure payment badges and recognizable gateways, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Stripe. When shoppers feel confident their payment is safe, they’re far more likely to hit “Buy now.” And one last tip: keep it simple. The fewer distractions and clicks, the smoother the path to purchase. That’s precisely what drives conversions during a last minute Black Friday rush. Black Friday emails have been shown to generate 33 percent higher conversion rates than regular marketing messages. That alone makes it one of the smartest last minute Black Friday tips to focus on. When time is short, your existing customer base is your best asset. They already trust your brand and are far more likely to act quickly on your offers. Keep your email focused and straightforward. Start with a subject line that clearly highlights your best deal or most significant discount. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see how the key offer or discount is prominently displayed in the subject line, while the body reinforces the offer with a clear call to action. Inside the email, make your main offer impossible to miss. Emphasize the key benefits of your product or service, and include a direct call to action that takes users straight to your Black Friday sale page. Make it visually engaging by adding a countdown timer or a short GIF that brings energy and urgency to the message. Remember, this isn’t about crafting a perfect campaign. It’s about getting the right message to the right people at the right time. A simple, well-timed email can make a real difference in your Black Friday sales. Social media continues to play a significant role in Black Friday success. It has seen a 7 percent year-over-year increase in traffic, now driving around 10 percent of all global mobile traffic referrals during the holiday season. Your audience is already scrolling, searching, and shopping, so this is your opportunity to be where they are. In these last few days, your social media strategy should focus on building anticipation and trust. If you have customer review videos, testimonials, or any user-generated content, start sharing them now. Boosting these posts or running quick ad campaigns featuring real customer stories can help you build credibility fast. People are far more likely to buy when they see genuine experiences from others. You can also collaborate with a micro-influencer or a brand advocate who already has a connection with your target audience. Even a brief post, story, or reel from them can draw attention to your sale and help you gain visibility. If you are short on time, focus only on your most active platform, whether that is Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or LinkedIn. Post your best offer as a pinned post or a story highlight and use countdown stickers or short video snippets to create a sense of urgency. Lastly, remember to engage. Reply to comments, answer questions, and reshare posts from happy customers. Small interactions can make your brand feel more approachable and help you stand out during the Black Friday rush. Must read: How to handle comments on your blog If you haven’t touched your SEO yet, don’t worry. There’s still time to make a few quick updates that can help your store appear in the search results. These last minute Black Friday SEO tweaks can enhance visibility, attract the right audience, and might give your deals a competitive edge. Start with your meta titles and meta descriptions. Add words like Black Friday 2025, sale, or deal to your titles so searchers know what to expect. For example, instead of ‘Women’s handbags – Classic collection,’ you can try ‘Black Friday 2025 deals on women’s handbags.’ Keep it relevant, natural, and clear. Next, check your product and landing pages. Make sure they’re up to date with current pricing, stock status, and offers. Highlight the discounts in your product descriptions, and, if possible, include keywords that shoppers might search for, such as ‘best Black Friday deals’ or ‘holiday gift offers.’ Another smart move is to reuse your existing content. If you already have an older Black Friday or holiday gift guide, simply refresh it for 2025 by updating the year, offers, and internal links. It’s a fast way to keep your content relevant without having to start from scratch. Lastly, take a minute to review your page experience. A fast, mobile-friendly site can make or break your Black Friday sales. Run a quick check using Google’s PageSpeed Insights and fix anything that’s slowing your pages down. Even minor improvements can help increase conversions. These quick wins may not replace a comprehensive Black Friday SEO strategy. However, they can still make your website more discoverable and help you capture traffic from shoppers actively seeking deals. Okay, so the must-dos can help you frame a solid last minute marketing campaign. But if you’ve managed to check those off quickly and still have a little time on your hands, don’t stop there. The following few ideas may seem optional, but they can give your campaign the extra boost it needs to capture more attention, convert hesitant shoppers, and capitalize on the Black Friday rush. Don’t let potential buyers slip away after visiting your store. Retargeting ads help remind them of products they viewed or added to their carts, increasing the chances of conversion. Even a short, time-bound campaign with strong visuals and clear CTAs can make a difference during the Black Friday rush. Shoppers love convenience, especially during the holidays. Bundling complementary products or creating quick gift sets can simplify decision-making and increase your average order value. Highlight these as limited-time deals to develop a sense of urgency and drive faster sales. Many customers abandon their carts when questions go unanswered. Adding a live chat feature helps resolve last minute queries instantly and keeps buyers engaged throughout the checkout process. Tools like Tidio and LiveChat integrate seamlessly with both WordPress and Shopify, making setup quick and easy. Getting your offers in front of the right people starts with how your website appears and performs in search results. That’s where Yoast SEO can be a real game-changer during the Black Friday rush. Here’s how: With Yoast SEO, you can create content that both readers and search engines understand. With Yoast SEO’s real-time feedback: Shoppers move fast during Black Friday.

Instead, focus on achievable actions that create immediate impact. Refresh your existing content, refine your offers, and utilize tools like Yoast SEO to optimize your pages efficiently.

We think there is nothing to fear in ANET stock, considering its overall Very Strong operational performance and financial health. Therefore, despite its Very High valuation, the stock is seen as Attractive but Volatile. Here is our evaluation: ANET stock has seen a notable decline recently, and we see it as attractive yet volatile.

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. The generative AI boom is characterized by massive debt accumulation, projected to reach $1.5 trillion for infrastructure by 2028, and concerning circular financing schemes where investors fund customers who then buy their products.Significant financial instability is evident from OpenAI's high cash burn and the 95% failure rate of AI pilot projects, raising doubts about the sector's actual return on investment and profitability. The generative AI boom grew even bigger this week when Open AI announced its latest multibillion-dollar chip deal, this time with Broadcom – sending its stock up 10%, CNBC reported. The agreement, along with pacts with AMD and Oracle, is one of many that’s pumping money into an AI bubble that looks like it could end much like the dot-com bubble did. Will it end liked the dot-com collapse — which sent the Nasdaq down 78%? If such a value decimation began today, it would ultimately swipe $40 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. Or will the Gen AI boom continue for decades? Read on to learn how to tell which scenario is most likely. In March 2000, the dot-com bubble – which began with the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape – began bursting. The collapse subtracted $3.6 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. There was also lots of debt -- $500 billion borrowed to build fiber optic networks went largely unrepaid due to the bankruptcy of telecom providers such as WorldCom and Global Crossing. While the Nasdaq began declining from its peak on March 10, two events on March 20, 2000 lit the fuse to this cash conflagration. That day "Burning Up," a Barron’s cover story by Jack Willoughby – who interviewed me for the article – was published. Willoughby’s column listed 51 publicly traded Internet firms he forecast would burn through their cash out of 207 by March 2001. That same day, MicroStrategy – whose CEO Michael Saylor is now Executive Chairman leading the renamed company’s strategy of selling stock to buy bitcoin – announced a revenue restatement for 1998 to 1999 due to "aggressive accounting practices," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. MicroStrategy’s accounting irregularities further shattered investor confidence. By April, the company also restated 1997 results – news of which sent the stock down 91% from its peak. The GenAI boom has certain parallels with the dot-com one. There is OpenAI – the cash incinerating startup driving the hype; debt-heavy infrastructure operators such as CoreWeave; and cash rich providers of customer financing – notably Nvidia and Oracle – to encourage those cash-burning startups to buy more of their picks and shovels, about which I wrote in my book Brain Rush. To build data centers, infrastructure operators are borrowing more than $1 trillion, according to a recent Morgan Stanley study. This could end badly if the cash required to repay that debt is insufficient to cover interest payments. I see three scenarios: GenAI keeps booming, there’s a soft-landing in which valuations decline somewhat, and the OpenAI bankruptcy scenario which brings it all down abruptly should the company be unable to raise more capital to fund its money-losing operations. The bursting of the dot-com bubble wiped out more equity – much of it held by individuals because so many dot-com companies had gone public – than debt. But the unpaid debt damaged lenders and other institutions. For example, WorldCom’s $41 billion bankruptcy and Global Crossing’s $12.4 billion collapse resulted from debt service way in excess of their money losing operations’ ability to repay. During the telecom boom, companies laid 80 million miles of fiber optic cable – between 85% and 95% of which remained unused years after the crash, The Bubble Bubble reported. Today’s GenAI boom could wipe out a significant amount of privately held equity value. While it does not appear a peak has been reached, the debt taken on to finance the building of AI data centers is expected to be even larger than it was during the dot-com boom. Major tech companies pledged a record $320 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, Fortune wrote. That number is growing so much that capex is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2028 – a whopping $1.5 trillion of which will come from various forms of debt, according to Morgan Stanley. Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft generate massive cash flows. But the growth in debt to build AI data centers highlights the strain on their internal resources. The Morgan Stanley report suggests external financing, including high-cost private credit deals, is necessary to supplement their free cash flow. Investors should note Oracle’s recent experience: the company is already losing $100 million quarterly on its data center rentals to OpenAI noted AInvest despite signing a $300 billion, five-year deal, as I wrote in a September Forbes post. If Oracle — a relatively disciplined operator— can’t make AI infrastructure profitable, who can? The most alarming parallel to 2000 involves circular financing arrangements in which a company finances its customer’s purchases. Nvidia, Microsoft and others are now engaging in this practice. Here are five examples: These circular deals are not enough to satisfy OpenAI’s ambition. The company aims to build 250 gigawatts of new computing capacity by 2033 with a price tag exceeding $10 trillion, noted Bloomberg. What if enterprises – which are consuming much of the the data center capacity being built to train and operate AI chatbots – decide they are wasting their money? With 95% of AI pilot projects failing to to yield meaningful results, according to MIT NANDA, that absence of a return on their $40 billion investment could come soon if a recession is near. What could trigger a bursting of the AI boom? OpenAI needs to reach $125 billion in revenue just to break even—a target not expected until 2029, Reuters reported. Until then, the ChatGPT provider must finance its losses by raising capital. A loss of confidence in the industry’s ability to borrow money to build more AI data centers could send investors scrambling for the exits. However, given the small number of publicly-traded AI chatbot providers, it is difficult to envision another article like Willoughby’s March 2000 “Burning Up” – which was based on dozens of public companies likely to burn through their cash. Differences between today and 2000 may make a GenAI crash less severe. Unlike the dot-com era’s 2,288 IPOs, noted International Banker, many of today’s AI companies remain private. More than 300 enterprise software unicorns are trapped without exits. Their median age is “11.5 years, and 50% need to raise or exit within 12 months,” wrote SaaStr. The relatively small number of GenAI IPOs could limit the damage of a crash. In 2000, retail investors were borrowing money to bet on publicly-traded Internet companies which collapsed after they burned through their cash. Retail investors’ losses spread the dot-com collapse’s pain more widely. If recently public GenAI companies – such as CoreWeave or SoundHound -- were to implode, their relatively small number might limit the damage. Another thing that’s better about today is the high profitability of many of the tech giants betting on AI. Today, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 contribute 28.8% of total earnings – a big jump from 2000’s 16.1%, reported Fortune. Investors should prepare for three scenarios: To get a sense of which scenario is most likely investors should monitor these indicators: When today’s equivalent of Willoughy’s Barron’s article appears — providing specific data on which companies will run out of cash when — the psychological foundation will crack. The question is not if such a moment comes, but when, and whether the AI boom’s stronger fundamentals can cushion the fall that dot-com’s relative lack of substance made inevitable.

Title: 4 New AI Jobs That Pay Up To $200,000+ In 2026
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/10/15/4-new-ai-jobs-that-pay-up-to-200000-in-2026/

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. We hear a lot about AI disrupting the workforce and making millions of jobs obsolete. We’ve seen AI-related layoffs last year and this year, with plans being drawn up for more layoffs at large companies like Amazon. But what roles is artificial intelligence actually creating? What are the new jobs of the future, the roles that will be in high demand in 2026 and beyond? In this article, you’ll learn about four AI jobs that you’ve probably never heard of, which offer eye-watering lucrative salaries of up to $200,000 and above. These will be the hot jobs of 2026 and will continue to grow in demand as AI implementation is rolled out across organizations. Keep reading to discover what these AI jobs are, the responsibilities involved, and how much they pay: This is the hottest new addition to the C-suite in 2025 and will continue to rise in demand in 2026. According to Asana’s Global State of AI at Work report, companies that have experienced the most success in terms of ROI and productivity when it comes to rolling out AI across their organizations, have designated roles in place, and have a strong strategy, treating it as a business-critical resource (82%). Part of this strategy involves having someone dedicated to AI implementation, digital transformation, and AI ethics and policy in the organization. This has carved the way for this new role, Chief AI Officer, who sits at the executive level and oversees all things AI implementation and strategy. Because this role, and many of the others listed below, are fairly new, we still don’t have access to broad numbers of salary data. However, based on the available information from salary comparison sites such as ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and analyzing job listings, here is what you can expect as an average pay rate in the U.S.: Average salary: $259,502 (some companies offer eye-watering pay packages in excess of $1 million) As a generative AI content expert, you would be optimizing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), by creating high-quality training data, using your own judgment to close gaps of information, and using your creativity to train AI models that produce the best outputs. An AI content expert or strategist’s job title can also refer to using AI tools to create and deliver a content schedule on behalf of a business, using your eye for detail to tweak the output and ensure accuracy while maintaining the company’s voice. Because this title is used to mean different responsibilities, take time to thoroughly review the job description before applying, so you know what you’re getting into. This role is best suited for professionals with extensive writing experience and a strong grasp on grammar, original creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Having STEM background may also be preferred by some employers. Average salary: $55,000 to $90,000+ (there aren’t many advertized salaries in this field yet) An applied AI engineer builds, develops, and deploys customized AI solutions for a business to use internally and for their clients. Many of these roles are associated with building and deploying AI agents, which are the buzzword in workplaces right now. These customized solutions enable a business to implement AI and work at scale, using artificial intelligence in a way that best works for their needs, rendering them more effective when it comes to AI integration, or AI scalers, as Asana's State of AI report refers to them. As an example of what you’d be expected to deliver in this role, a job posting by The General Intelligence Company of New York says: When describing what they’d look for in their ideal Applied AI Agent Engineer candidate, the job posting says: Average salary: $154,442 When AI is being rolled out in an organization, there has to be guardrails in place. Otherwise, the company can incur great risk. One thing Asana’s report noted is that AI infrastructure requires three Ps: policy, psychological safety, and performance. The first P, policy, is where an AI ethics lead comes in. You’ll be responsible for “developing clear frameworks that provide guardrails without bureaucracy, defining who does what, when AI is appropriate, and how quality gets maintained.” This ensures safe practices for users as well as those on the receiving end of the output. As an example, OpenAI is currently hiring for a software engineer for AI safety, and the salary on offer is $210,000 – $325,000 plus equity. Average salary: $242,471 To succeed in these roles and land lucrative, niche, AI jobs, here’s what you need to start doing now: Keep upskilling and make your skills niche and relevant. Focus on ways that you can provide direct financial value and translate your technical expertise to niche business solutions. This is what enterprises are looking for. Constantly update and share your portfolio on LinkedIn. Then, monetize your expertise by teaching it online or by selling your projects. Finally, learn how to make your skills marketable so that you can catch the attention of employers and high-caliber clients.

Δ Those cuts could include up to 15% of the tech giant’s human resources (HR) staff, Fortune reported late Tuesday (Oct. 14), citing multiple sources familiar with the plans. Aside from HR, other areas of the company’s consumer business are also likely to be affected, two of the sources said. The Fortune report notes that the cuts are happening at a time when Amazon is seeking ways to reduce employee costs while spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure for in-house use and as an enterprise offering. Amazon has said it aims to spend more than $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, as it expands its cloud and AI datacenters. This follows a series of layoffs in other parts of the company earlier this year, including consumer devices unit, the Wondery podcast arm, and in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the time, Amazon noted that it was still hiring throughout the company, including AWS roles. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue While those layoffs came soon after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence (AI) would lead to job cuts, the company stressed to PYMNTS at the time that these cuts were not connected to AI, but instead followed a review of areas that could be streamlined. PYMNTS has reached out to Amazon for comment about this latest round of cuts, but has not yet gotten a reply. Jassy in June sent a message to Amazon workers saying that employees who have learned to use AI will be in a better position to be a part of the company. He added that Amazon’s corporate workforce would likely shrink in the next few years as the company embraces AI, calling it the most transformative technology since the advent of the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, from the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” found that more than half (54%) of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The study also found that 38% of workers said they were worried the technology could eventually lead to their jobs being eliminated.

Title: Reasons Behind Microsoft's Recent 40% Stock Surge

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 40.1% fluctuation in Microsoft (MSFT) stock between 4/17/2025 and 10/14/2025 can be largely attributed to a 27.5% variation in the company's P/E Multiple. Although there is more to this narrative than mere figures, let’s first analyze the stock price trends and their influencing factors. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is considerable advantage to a more diversified strategy, such as the one we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock that appeals to you, or should you create a portfolio that is structured to succeed throughout market cycles? Our analyses indicate that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed the uncertainty of stock selection into reliable market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation framework of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm and Trefis collaborator – whose asset allocation strategy achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 crisis when the S&P 500 plummeted by over 40%. Returning to the "change": The shifts in fundamental aspects such as valuation, revenue, and profit margins reflect underlying business dynamics and investor sentiment. Below, we outline the key factors that affected the stock price movements for MSFT. For context, MSFT provides software, services, devices, and solutions, including Office, Microsoft Teams, Windows OEM licensing, and productivity tools to meet both business and personal computing demands. Opinion: At present, we view MSFT stock as relatively overpriced. Why is that the case? Investigate the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell MSFT Stock to understand the factors influencing our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, Microsoft is not immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of approximately 65% during the Dot-Com bubble and nearly 58% in the Global Financial Crisis. Recent shocks have also led to considerable declines — around 37% in the inflation spike and nearly 28% amid the Covid sell-off. The lesser correction in 2018 still resulted in a fall of over 18%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but when the market undergoes severe sell-offs, even leading stocks like MSFT can be caught in the downturn. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor — particularly given the volatility that comes with an individual stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising of 30 stocks, has a proven history of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 throughout the last four years. Why does that happen? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Are Leveraged ETFs to Blame for Selloffs? JPM Says Yes

Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com When markets tumble, everyone starts looking for a suspect, and leveraged ETFs could be next in the police lineup. JPMorgan analysts blamed levered ETFs for Friday’s stock selloff, which resulted in the S&P 500’s biggest one-day loss since April, in a research note published Monday. JPMorgan Managing Director Bram Kaplan said leveraged products will “likely trigger further systematic selling flows this week, leaving markets fragile.” Although the drop was triggered initially by President Donald Trump’s threat of new tariffs against China, the note estimated that roughly $26 billion of selloffs from leveraged ETFs worsened the decline. While experts agreed on the dangers posed to individual investors by leveraged funds, not everyone was convinced of their widespread risks. “I wouldn’t say that leveraged ETFs wholesale create systemic issues,” said Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s director of ETF and passive strategies. “But there definitely have been instances where they make things worse.” Leveraged ETFs are still relatively new to the scene, but the role they play in shaping macroeconomic trends might be outsized. Leveraged ETFs typically hold swaps instead of options. Because of the structure and high liquidity of swaps, their price can swing wildly, particularly in leveraged products, which promise 2x or 3x returns on underlying holdings. “Forced buying and selling when everyone knows roughly what they’re going to have to do can be very problematic,” Armour said. “It can increase volatility [and] hurt investors in the leveraged ETF, because then they have to sell lower and buy higher each day.” Still, there is reason to believe levered products aren’t all to blame: Ultimately, Armour doesn’t think the amount of assets these ETFs currently hold is significant enough to have much of an impact. The largest 3x leveraged product is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), which only has around $29 billion in AUM, according to VettaFi data. Doesn’t Ring a Bell. The hope is that individuals will recognize the risks of these funds before buying into them, said Morningstar research analyst Lan Anh Tran. “It’s hard to tell where investors are interested in putting their money next,” she said. “With these leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs, they blow up every once in a while, and then the next year, it seems people are going through a collective amnesia. They forget that that ever happened.” As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How I Became a Populist

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. I wasn’t surprised to see JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on stage yesterday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit. I’ve interviewed several women leaders over the years—TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett, Travelers Chief Marketing Officer Lisa Caputo, Mary Callahan Erdoes, who runs JPMorgan Chase’s Asset & Wealth Management, and veteran finance executive Heidi Miller, among others—who consider Dimon an important mentor. Women make up half of JPMorgan’s board and seven of the 13 members of its operating committee. Dimon spoke with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell about topics ranging from AI to blockchain, which you can read about here and here. Fresh from reporting a banner quarter, the bank chief expounded on AI, gold, regulation, jobs, tariffs, debt, government waste, New York’s mayoral race, and “the need to keep the Western world together economically.” You can check out the full interview here. And here’s what I’ve gleaned from attendees, when it comes to Dimon’s mentorship approach: Bet on Winners: Dimon helps people who’ve earned his respect and trust, whether it’s hiring people like Miller at multiple companies or advising Duckett during her inaugural year as CEO of TIAA. That instinct isn’t limited to women: Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf comes to mind. Dimon says he’s guided by performance, not gender or loyalty. To do otherwise, in his view, is a disservice to the team. Share your network: Lisa Caputo met Dimon after he’d been fired from Citigroup and she had just arrived there. As she put it yesterday: “I was trying to build a women’s business from scratch. Every time Jamie would call, he would give me the names of three people to talk to inside the company, and he would also ask me what I’d learned so far. Through my conversations with him, he was literally helping me shape what the business model could look like.” Go Beyond Borders: Anyone who launches a $1.5 trillion initiative is seeking a purpose beyond their own company. After almost two decades as CEO, Dimon expects ambitious people may leave. Part of his job is to help good people become better leaders wherever they go. The world needs more of them. Relationships matter. And having friends in far places helps a leader learn.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Why the U.S. Supreme Court might keep Trump’s tariffs On their face, President Trump’s trade tariffs are illegal because Congress did not approve them and because routine trade is not the “emergency” that Trump claims. But the U.S. Supreme Court may rule to leave them in place anyway because of the logistical difficulty of undoing them, according to former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. “The government is coming to court and saying, ‘We would have to unwind billions or trillions of dollars. It could bankrupt our nation,’” she said. Trump considers cooking oil ban for China “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China,” the president said on Truth Social. Investors took it as a signal that there would be no immediate compromise in the trade war, sending the S&P 500 down 0.16% on the day. Trump preps list of programs he will eliminate The U.S. government shutdown shows no sign of coming to an end. Yesterday the president said he was drawing up a list of “egregious socialist, semi-communist” government programs that he would eliminate permanently if Democrats in Congress don’t help him pass his spending bill. “We're closing up programs ... that we wanted to close up or that we never wanted to happen,” Trump said. “We're not going to let them come back.” Dimon issues private credit warning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more” JPMorgan Chase wrote off $170 million in debt it was owed in the collapse of auto parts supply company First Brands, the company reported in its Q3 earnings call, and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon warned there may be more cracks in the private credit markets to come: “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan also warned of “late-cycle accidents” but Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said it was not a systemic problem. Powell hints at further rate cuts In a speech on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the institution is likely to cut rates again as a weak job market trumps inflation concerns. Policy changes may need to “take another step toward a more neutral stance,” Powell said at the National Association for Business Economics. Amazon is preparing a new round of layoffs Amazon is planning to lay off as much as 15% of the company’s human resources staff, according to sources familiar with the situation, with other departments likely to be affected as well. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment on the situation. Mark Cuban says employees deserve more stock Billionaire Mark Cuban wrote in a post on X that companies should be better incentivized to give shares to their employees as stock gains multiply. The post was in response to a recent report from Oxfam showing that billionaire wealth has increased by $33 trillion since 2015. Sam Altman says OpenAI will allow “erotica for verified adults” “Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,” he said. Separately, Deutsche Bank reported that subscriptions at OpenAI have “flatlined.” S&P 500 futures were up 0.47% this morning. The index closed down 0.16% in its last session.

Title: Amazon likely to cut 15% jobs in new round of AI-driven layoffs: Report
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazon-new-round-of-ai-driven-layoffs-report-10308167/

Amazon is looking to eliminate 15 per cent of jobs from its human resources division even as the tech giant continues to aggressively invest in developing AI products and infrastructure. Internally referred to as the People Experience Technology (PXT) team, the HR division at Amazon comprises over 10,000 employees across the world, including a recruiting team, technology staff, and other HR-related roles. The upcoming round of layoffs at Amazon is expected to impact the PXT team hardest, according to a report by Fortune. Employees in other divisions involving Amazon’s core consumer business could also be affected by the layoffs, the report said. The exact number of employees that will be let go and when the layoffs are expected to happen is still unclear. The latest round of job cuts at Amazon comes amid a deteriorating job market for those in the tech sector, with several big tech companies looking to leverage AI tools in order to shrink headcounts and lower costs. While many AI-related layoffs are being framed as ‘restructuring’ efforts, big tech firms are simultaneously ramping up investments in data centres and compute to stay ahead in the AI arms race. Amazon, for instance, has earmarked over $100 billion in capital expenditures this year to build out its cloud and AI data centres. In June this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had announced in a memo to its 1.5 million employees that, as the company embraces AI tools across the organisation, it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy added that generative AI will ‘change the way our work is done,’ and said the company will eventually ‘need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.’ “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he further said. Taking over as CEO from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy oversaw the largest layoffs in the company’s history roughly two years ago, when Amazon cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs. Earlier this year, Amazon also laid off employees in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant also announced this week that it will be hiring over 2,50,000 seasonal employees across its warehouses and logistics networks in the US ahead of the holiday season. India has strongly condemned Pakistan’s recent military actions along the Afghan border, accusing Islamabad of sheltering and sponsoring terrorist organisations amid escalating tensions between the two neighbours. At a press briefing on Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also underlined New Delhi’s support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and independence.

Amazon layoff news: E-commerce and tech giant Amazon is set to slash as much as 15 per cent roles in its human resources department, besides some other roles, in a new round of layoffs, Fortune reported citing sources. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to respond, it added. While it is expected that Amazon's HR team, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, which has over 10,000 staff globally, will take the most cuts, other core consumer business departments could also see some impact, two sources told the publication. As per the report, these job cuts come as the giant looks to reduce employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence products and AI infrastructure. Amazon has stated it aims to spend over $100 billion capex in 2025 to build its AI data centres and cloud computing centres. These will be for sale to customers and for internal use, the report added. From late 2022 into 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy signed off on at least 27,000 job cuts at Amazon — largely from its corporate offices. The period saw many large tech companies, including Meta and Google, slashing jobs. In June, Andy Jassy in a company memo stressed the importance of AI adoption to employees. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added. Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire 2,50,000 workers during its peak holiday season in full-time, part-time and seasonal roles. The company in a statement said that temporary workers will earn $19 per hour on average, and permanent roles will pay $23 per hour on average. The 2,50,000 workers on holiday hire is unchanged from the previous two years, a Bloomberg report noted.

Amazon is planning to cut human resources staff by 15%, Fortune reported, citing sources. People eXperience Technology Team, human resource department of the company, will be the worst hit in the move. Core consumer business will probably to be affected by the move as well. Fortune's report did not mention how many number of employees, and when they will be laid off. Amazon's PXT division has more than 10,000 employees worldwide. The team includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional human resource roles, the report said. Compared to other companies, Amazon has laid off a relatively small number of people early this year. The layoffs happened in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and in the Amazon web series. The company is looking for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in artificial intelligence products and infrastructure. Amazon intends to increase the use of AI for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers, Fortune said. Amazon has planned to spend upwards of $100 billion capital expenditure this year as it builds its cloud and AI data centres, according to the report. Meanwhile, Amazon will likely add 250,000 to its workforce during its peak season, Bloomberg reported. The aggressive hiring during holiday season makes the company a standout in an otherwise bleak holiday labour market. Amazon will hire for full-time, part-time, and season roles with temporary workers earning an average of $19 per hour, Bloomberg reported, citing a statement from Amazon. Pay for permanent roles averages $23 per hour. US shoppers will likely spend $253.4 billion on online shopping during November and December, which indicates a 5.3% upside from 2024, according to Adobe Inc. However, shoppers are also planning to curb overall holiday spending because of tariff-related price increases and a weakening labour market, according to a survey released in September by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Two sources told Fortune that Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but that other areas of Amazon’s core consumer business are also likely to be affected. It couldn’t be learned how many employees in total Amazon plans to let go, nor the exact timing of the cuts. The company laid off relatively small numbers of employees earlier this year in areas such as its consumer devices unit, its Wondery podcast division, and in Amazon Web Services. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment.Amazon’s PXT division, which reports to senior vice president Beth Galetti, has more than 10,000 employees worldwide, and includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional HR roles. The new cuts come as Amazon continues to look for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in AI products and infrastructure—both for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers. The company has said it intends to devote upwards of $100 billion to capital expenditures this year, as it builds out its cloud and AI data centers. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in company history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed.Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staffers on their payrolls.Jassy himself is one of them. The CEO fired a bit of a warning shot to his own employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO job in 2021, has earned a reputation as a cost-cutter (though to be fair, he inherited a company that many say had become wasteful and bloated in some areas). Amazon executives regularly require managers to hit a certain percentage goal for unregretted attrition, or URA—essentially a percentage of employees that the company would be okay losing, whether through voluntary departures, being “managed out,” or through formal layoffs. But sources told Fortune that these cuts are being discussed in a different way internally than the typical URA process. While Amazon plans these layoffs of corporate roles, the company announced its usual holiday hiring spree of warehouse staff on Tuesday. This year, the company will hire 250,000 seasonal employees across its U.S. warehouse and logistics networks. Amazon’s stock price is down a little more than 1% this calendar year, but 15% higher than it was 12 months earlier. The company will report earnings later this month.

Title: A Paralegal’s AI Best Friend
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-prompt/2025/10/14/a-paralegals-ai-best-friend/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T23:45:05Z
Full Content:
ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Welcome back to The Prompt. About a year ago, Viraj Bindra watched as his friend’s law firm struggled with a deluge of cases, far more than it had the capacity to handle. In the end, the firm had to turn away cases that had a fair chance of winning simply because it didn’t have the bandwidth. Bindra soon learned that this is a widespread problem that impacts a lot of people: Some 77% of American households can’t access legal help when they need it, in part due to staffing shortages at law firms. “For everyday Americans, counsel is more of a luxury than a right,” he said. So Bindra, an ex-DoorDash product manager, decided to build AI software to ease that burden–and help lawyers more easily manage lots of clients. In April 2025, he launched Finch, a voice-based AI system that automates administrative tasks typically done by paralegals, such as retrieving medical records, setting up and tracking insurance claims, etc. The startup also hires its own paralegals to ensure and improve the accuracy of its product. Finch is “taking on the work that otherwise a law firm would've had to hire staff to do,” he said. The New York-based startup is selling its technology to personal injury lawyers and plaintiff firms that make money based on contingency, meaning they aren’t paid unless there’s a settlement or victory at trial. These lawyers are more incentivized to use AI than those who bill their clients hourly, as it helps their staff’s productivity and allows them to take on more cases, Bindra said. In just six months, Bindra claims his startup has seen significant revenue growth though he declined to disclose specific numbers. The company announced today it has raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, which valued it at $100 million, according to a person familiar with the round. It’s a solid start, but Finch faces a growing cluster of competitors with startups like Harvey, Legora and EvenUp already emerging as front runners in the AI legal landscape. Meera Clark, a partner at Redpoint Ventures said Finch’s biggest differentiator is its focus on helping smaller law firms save direct labor costs. Let’s get into the headlines. BIG PLAYS Retail giant Walmart is doubling down on AI. The company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow users to shop for its products directly through ChatGPT. The idea is that people who are already using the tool to plan meals and find new recipes can also buy needed ingredients while they’re at it. In recent months, OpenAI has made a concerted effort to add e-commerce capabilities to ChatGPT, recently forging similar deals with Shopify and Etsy. CHIPS + COMPUTE On the heels of its massive deal with chip giant AMD, OpenAI announced yet another partnership, this time with Broadcom. Under this deal, OpenAI will design its own chips to train and run its models while Broadcom will provide infrastructure support like networking systems and custom chips for its planned buildout of 10 gigawatts worth of AI data centers. Broadcom’s shares jumped after the announcement, similar to other companies that have announced multi-billion dollar partnerships with OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman is clearly adept at crafting these deals, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine writes, by selling established companies a “world-changing vision” of the future of artificial intelligence to raise historic amounts of capital. SHOW ME THE MONEY Salesforce plans to invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years to ramp up AI adoption across enterprises, the company said at its annual Dreamforce conference, though details on the investment are still unclear. The funding will be used to create an AI incubator hub on its San Francisco campus and upskill employees on how to use AI. Investors seemed unimpressed by the announcement–its share price closed down 3.6%, continuing the 28% slide it's seen so far this year. DEEP DIVE It’s been a big year for AI infrastructure deals. In just the last month, OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and others have announced epic transactions worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The deals are complex, unconventional—and often circular: Nvidia’s up to $100 billion investment in OpenAI, announced late last month, for instance, will allow OpenAI to purchase Nvidia GPUs to build out its own data center capacity. In a similar deal that flips who gets equity, AMD and OpenAI recently announced their own strategic partnership in which OpenAI got a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, or 10% of AMD’s shares, that vests in tranches based on OpenAI using 6 gigawatts of AMDs GPUs over a period of time. Behind this spate of deals is something of a stampede mentality. “The world needs much more compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X announcing the AMD deal. Altman has been trumpeting that “more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission” for years. “There's so much impatience and desire to move quickly and fear of getting left behind that there’s a very high premium on getting the most you can the fastest,” says Stella Biderman, executive director of AI nonprofit EleutherAI, which trained an open-source version of GPT-3 on CoreWeave GPUs. And that’s leading them to make these scratch-my-back deals that are literally set up to help them help one another. Thanks in large part to the big deals, valuations are skyrocketing, and the billionaire founders, executives and investors tied to the massive AI data center buildout have benefited the most. By Forbes’ count, 20 of the most notable billionaires tied to the explosive growth in AI infrastructure spending have already added more than $450 billion to their fortunes since January 1. Read the full story on Forbes. MODEL BEHAVIOR AI-powered bots accounted for around 51 percent of internet traffic in 2024. Thanks to Sora, OpenAI’s social media platform to share AI-generated videos, more AI slop is proliferating across social media, making it harder to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. Large language models are writing everything from tweets to blog posts to resumes while fake candidates are giving job interviews to AI agents, opening bank accounts and buying concert tickets. All that AI has led tech leaders like Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to propound the “dead internet theory”— the idea that the internet is dominated by bots instead of humans. Once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, this may be coming true in the age of AI.

The king of precious metals is having a good run right now. That might be a problem. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. When prices are high and global conflicts destabilize the world, some investors start looking backwards—away from an uncertain future and toward the predictability of the past. And what’s older and more dependable than gold? Last week, amid widespread geopolitical turmoil and a weakening U.S. dollar, the price of gold hit a historic high of $4,000 an ounce. This year has so far been gold’s best since 1979, a moment of instability so profound that it led to recession. Gold prices are much closer to a genuine “recession indicator” than, say, the resurgence of frozen yogurt or an uptick in Uber Eats orders. That’s because, over the past 50 years, spikes in the price of gold have typically been correlated with widespread inflation and geopolitical dysfunction. In 1979, amid double-digit inflation numbers in the United States and a global energy crisis, investors stocked up on the precious metal as a way to counter those shocks. In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, as investors lost trust in major institutions once seen as “too big to fail,” gold prices shot up again. And when persistent inflation was crushing the U.S. dollar after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, gold once again soared. The precious metal has long been considered a safe-haven asset, because, unlike the U.S. dollar, its inherent value isn’t determined by any state government. Although it’s probably not realistic for everyone to start piling into Diamond District jewelry shops and hoarding gold bars, gold remains an appealing, if old-fashioned, alternative to more contemporary investments: Its value stems from its shine and rarity, not its ability to produce a line of credit. Some investors see gold as a standard way to diversify their portfolio. Others, stereotypically known as goldbugs, tend to be broadly skeptical about contemporary monetary policy. Just as investors in bitcoin, so-called digital gold, have historically skewed libertarian and anti-institutional, the most extreme goldbugs are betting against the system, doubtful that the Federal Reserve is capable of keeping the U.S. dollar strong. There’s also only so much of the metal lodged in the planet’s crust, compared with the dollar, which can be printed ad infinitum. At least until someone like Elon Musk figures out how to increase its supply by mining asteroids, gold will likely remain the doomer’s hedge of choice. Whereas a different sort of investor looks to get in early on promising new technological innovations, the goldbug doesn’t lose sight of what’s tried-and-true. Gold prices have already risen more than 50 percent this year and are showing no signs of stopping. The story of today’s gold boom began in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Western governments decided to sanction the Russian central bank by freezing its foreign-exchange reserves. The scale of these sanctions was a reminder of why countries might want to own assets that can’t be easily frozen. Especially in emerging markets, central banks around the world “realized that the truly only safe asset” is gold, Daan Struyven, a co-head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, told me. The whiplash of President Donald Trump’s tariff spree this spring introduced new uncertainties for the global market. No nation or territory was off-limits (including remote islands inhabited only by penguins and seals). Trump’s scattershot approach has had clear consequences, especially for countries with fledgling markets. Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Indonesia are among the many nations now buying gold by the ton, according to World Bank data—ostensibly to insulate themselves from any future shocks caused by U.S. policy. Meanwhile, Struyven explained, the ongoing question of whether America’s own central bank will retain its independence could also be contributing to gold’s historic run, because “the gold price tends to rise when questions about central-bank governance rise.” The other main driver of this price spike is less abstract. Some Wall Streeters are concerned that the value of the U.S. dollar will continue to erode as the national debt climbs and the Federal Reserve loses its grip on the currency. They’re making what’s become known as the “Debasement Trade,” shifting money away from the weakening U.S. dollar and into harder, more independent assets such as gold and bitcoin. Shrinkflation, stagflation, good-old-fashioned inflation—all of it means that your paycheck doesn’t go as far as it once did, and all of it is good for gold. The mystery of the current gold rally is that the S&P 500 is also up. The stock-market index reached an all-time high earlier this month, which would seem to suggest that the American economy isn’t quite as close to the brink as the price of gold might indicate. But the reality probably has to do with a bifurcated market. Joe Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist, told The New York Times on Saturday that this rare case of gold and stocks moving in a parallel upward trend has to do with “dramatically different” investor perspectives: The optimists are going with equities, and the pessimists are going with gold. In today’s economy, there’s room enough for both. Another way to put it is that a bet on the S&P 500 amounts to faith in the fruits of modern industry: AI and renewable energy, to name a couple. A bet on gold is a recognition that all empires eventually fall, and a return to something much more ancient.

Evening Read The Drink That Americans Won’t Give Up Without a Fight By Ellen Cushing Coffee is in trouble. Even before the United States imposed tariffs of 50 percent on Brazil and 20 percent on Vietnam—which together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans—other challenges, including climate-change-related fires, flooding, and droughts, had already forced up coffee prices globally. Today, all told, coffee in the U.S. is nearly 40 percent more expensive than it was a year ago. Futures for arabica coffee—the beans most people in the world drink—have increased by almost a dollar since July. And prices may well go up further: Tariffs have “destabilized an already volatile market,” Sara Morrocchi, the CEO of the coffee consultancy Vuna, told me. This is a problem for the millions of people who grow and sell coffee around the world. It is also a problem for the people who rely on coffee for their base executive functioning—such a problem that Congress recently introduced a bipartisan bill to specifically protect coffee from Trump’s tariffs.

Title: AI Deals Are Scaling to Massive Valuations. But In Many Cases—Also Massive Dilution. See e.g., OpenAI
URL: https://www.saastr.com/ai-deals-are-scaling-to-massive-valuations-but-in-many-cases-also-massive-dilution-see-e-g-openai/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T22:12:21Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), SaaStr.Ai So there has never been a “start-up” like OpenAI. Already with 800,000,000+ users and a breathtaking $500 Billion (!) valuation. But it’s also raised and spent epic amounts. So as the chart from FT below shows — all the historic investors together, as a group, will likely own 10% after the company converts to a for-profit. All of them. From Khosla to Thrive to Founders Fund and more. OpenAI has now raised approximately $58 billion in primary funding across 11 rounds, with an additional $6.6 billion secondary sale in October 2025 at the $500 billion valuation. But the cash burn? That’s where it gets interesting. The company now projects it will burn $115 billion through 2029—that’s $80 billion higher than previously expected. Let that sink in. Not $115 billion raised. $115 billion burned. Breaking it down: This isn’t mismanagement. This is the cost of competing in frontier AI. The numbers are staggering: A 17x increase in less than three years. But when you’ve raised $58 billion and are burning over $100 billion to get there, the ownership math tells a different story. Looking at the projected ownership post-restructure (per FT Research and other sources): For founders and early investors who weren’t Microsoft, the dilution has been severe. Eight of the eleven original co-founders have left. Early VCs who got in at sub-$30 billion valuations have seen their ownership percentages compressed dramatically—even as the absolute dollar value has grown. The cap table now includes 11 funding rounds. What makes OpenAI’s story unique is who’s investing and why: Microsoft isn’t just an investor—they’re existentially dependent on OpenAI. Their entire AI strategy—Azure growth, Office Copilots, enterprise AI positioning—runs through OpenAI infrastructure. They’ll keep funding to protect that relationship. But they also receive ~20% of OpenAI’s revenue through their partnership agreement, creating a circular funding dynamic. Nvidia invested $100 million in October 2024 and gets paid back immediately through GPU purchases. They’ve invested in 50+ AI startups creating a circular economy where investment dollars flow back as compute revenue. Part of Microsoft’s and Nvidia’s investment effectively returns to their own coffers. SoftBank went from a $500 million investor in October 2024 to leading a $30 billion round six months later. That’s not normal venture behavior—that’s Masayoshi Son making a macro bet on AGI. Their commitment is so aggressive that if OpenAI doesn’t complete its for-profit conversion by December 31, 2025, SoftBank’s investment could be slashed from $30 billion to as low as $20 billion. Traditional VCs are playing a different game: raising larger funds on the AI narrative, marking up valuations in subsequent rounds, and hoping an exit materializes. But with 60+ investors on the cap table, exit dynamics will be complicated. Honestly it’s kind of based that employees will own 3x as much of OpenAI as VCs https://t.co/7MoOk6L8A1 — Luke Metro (@luke_metro) October 14, 2025 The October 2025 secondary sale is particularly revealing. OpenAI had authorized up to $10.3 billion in shares for sale but only about $6.6 billion ultimately changed hands. Why did employees sell less than authorized? Two possibilities: Either way, this was the second major secondary in a year—a clear signal that liquidity events are necessary to retain talent competing with Meta’s nine-figure offers and public company stock compensation. Here’s the structural complexity that matters: current investors still don’t own actual equity. They hold convertible notes that only convert to shares after the nonprofit-to-for-profit restructuring completes. This requires: The deadline? December 31, 2025. If the conversion fails, SoftBank’s investment drops from $30 billion to $20 billion, and other investors can demand their money back with 9% interest. That’s a potential $40+ billion liability. The OpenAI model isn’t replicable—but the dynamics are instructive: For AI infrastructure founders: If you’re building frontier models, you’re signing up for capital requirements that dwarf traditional SaaS. You’ll need to raise 4-5x your revenue run rate continuously. You might own 5-15% of something huge rather than 25% of something modest. And you’ll need to accept strategic investors who become customers, partners, and dependencies simultaneously. For AI application founders: The good news is you probably don’t need the OpenAI model. If you’re building on top of foundation models, your capital requirements are dramatically lower. But you’re also betting that OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider maintains reasonable API pricing as they burn billions. For investors: Traditional venture math is broken in frontier AI. A 10x return on a $500 billion valuation requires a $5 trillion outcome. You’re not investing for returns—you’re investing for: To be fair, the revenue growth is real: At a $500 billion valuation on $12.7 billion revenue, that’s roughly a 39x revenue multiple. For context, Salesforce trades at 8-9x, ServiceNow at 20x. But both are profitable. The bet is that by 2029, at $100 billion in revenue, a $500 billion valuation would be 5x revenue—reasonable for a high-growth software company. But that requires executing flawlessly for four years while burning $115 billion and fending off Google, Meta, Anthropic, and everyone else building AGI. Yes, OpenAI scaled to a $500 billion valuation faster than any company in history. Yes, they’re generating $12.7 billion in revenue with 500 million weekly users. Yes, they’ve created a new market category and changed how the world thinks about AI. But they’ve also: The valuation is spectacular. The dilution is equally spectacular. The capital requirements are unprecedented. The burn rate is staggering. All of these things are true simultaneously. This is the new reality of frontier AI. Not every hot AI deal will look like this, but many infrastructure plays will require similar capital intensity. The question isn’t whether you can raise at massive valuations—OpenAI proved you can. The question is whether the dilution, complexity, and burn make sense for your business model and your exit strategy. For most AI companies, the answer is no. For foundation model companies competing for AGI, it might be the only path forward.

October 14, 2025 14:26 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 15th mission of the year and the first of 21 new launches for Synspective. The “Owl New World” mission launched on Electron from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 16:33 UTC on October 14 to deploy the seventh StriX satellite to a 583km low Earth orbit. The mission was the first of a series of 21 dedicated Electron launches to take place between now and the end of the decade for Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan. It was also the seventh Electron mission completed for Synspective since launches to deploy their constellation began in December 2020. Altogether, Rocket Lab will launch 27 missions for Synspective, making Electron the primary launcher of their constellation. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “Another Electron launch for Synspective with 100% mission success, and a fantastic start to an exciting run of upcoming launches to deploy their constellation. Precise, direct access to orbit is essential to the iteration and growth of constellations already in space, and I’m proud of the Rocket Lab team for delivering this again and again for Synspective across every launch.” Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Rocket Lab for safely and successfully carrying out this mission, as well as to all the members of Synspective who made this achievement possible. Moving forward, we will continue to leverage our satellite and data analytics technologies to address global challenges, such as security, disaster management, and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the creation of a more resilient and sustainable future.” Electron’s unbeaten combination of reliability, rapid execution, and exceptional satellite deployment accuracy in the space industry’s commercial small-lift launch class has made it the favored rocket for constellation operators globally. Rocket Lab is expected to surpass its previous annual launch record achieved in 2024 with 16 launches, with scheduled missions for other commercial constellation operators and international space agencies in the coming weeks that are set to meet the Company’s forecast of 20+ launches in 2025.

The major U.S. equities indexes rebounded Tuesday afternoon from earlier losses amid lingering worries about U.S.-China trade tensions. The Dow and S&P 500 were slightly higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was little changed. Intel (INTC) shares dropped to lead losses on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after a downgrade by Bank of America analysts to "underperform" from "neutral," saying the stock has climbed "too far, too fast" on optimism about recent AI deals. Arista Networks (ANET) shares also fell after Nvidia (NVDA) announced Meta Platforms (META) and Oracle (ORCL) will use its data center switches, increasing competition with those from Arista. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) and other firms tied to cryptocurrencies sank along with the prices of digital coins. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) shares gained after the pizza delivery giant posted earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates as promotions and demand for its stuffed crust pizza boosted sales. Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) also climbed after the financial firm exceeded profit forecasts and boosted its profitability guidance as federal regulators lifted a cap on the bank's growth as punishment for a fake account scandal. Walmart (WMT) shares rose after the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer said it is partnering with OpenAI to allow customers to buy goods from Walmart through ChatGPT. Gold prices climbed to notch a fresh high above $4,100 an ounce. Crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was slightly lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the pound, but lost ground to the euro and yen.

Title: This Protects You From An AI Bubble, Pays 7.7% Dividends

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I know, I know. This levitating stock market feels like a bubble that will burst any day. So I get it if you’re nervous. And that’s actually a good thing. It pays to be wary when everyone else is throwing money at any asset—stocks included. My take? Well, it might surprise you, but it’s this: We’re not in a bubble—AI-driven or otherwise. But I get the fear—which is why we’re going to look at a two-step move that addresses it. This “best of both worlds” play gives us yields up to 8.2% and a hedge if, say, bullish analysts (like me!) end up wrong and the so-called “AI bubble” pops. Like I said, I think that’s unlikely. But in any market, it always pays to spread out our risks, which is why I think this two-step move makes a lot of sense now. You don’t have to look far to see what’s driving bubble worries. Over the last six months, stocks have soared 32.4%, or 65% annualized. There’s no way that can continue. Right? This perspective keeps people out of stocks, but we need to zoom out. Over the long haul, stocks have done well (but not too well) no matter when you bought them. Over the last decade, stocks have risen 12.9% on average per year. That’s above the century-long average of 10.5%, but not far above. And a higher gain now than in, say, the 1930s, makes sense. After all, our technology is better, and our companies are more efficient. So why shouldn’t stocks rise a bit faster than they used to? So, at the very least, we can say that the last decade has been very good for stocks, but not bubbly. To see what a real bubble looks like, let’s flip back 30 years or so. From 1996 to 2000, stocks returned 24.3% annualized. But most important, that was after several years of strong performance. Meantime, our recent strong market comes after two big selloffs: first due to the pandemic in 2020, and second due to misplaced recession fears in 2022. So a bit of short-term outperformance to offset short-term underperformance makes sense. And that’s before we talk about AI. I had a chat with an old friend who’s now the head of the English department at a small liberal-arts school. He was telling me that he doesn’t know how to plan the curriculum for the upcoming school year because, as he put it, “All anyone wants to talk about is artificial intelligence.” If even liberal-arts schools are obsessed over AI, should we worry that we’re in a bubble? If you look at Google Trends for the phrase “AI bubble,” you can see that, well, there is a bubble of worry about AI. No wonder the AI-bubble case is capturing the thinking of banks, private equity investors and journalists. But let’s stress test this assumption. Our first stop? The CNN Fear and Greed Index. A lack of greed has led to a “neutral” reading, or a market where the fears of bubble prognosticators and the hopes of pollyanna-ish speculators cancel each other out. This is a realistic indicator that, no, we’re not in a bubble—at least not at the inflationary peak of the bubble cycle. A lot of data is telling us that the economy is strong and inflation is high—and that’s not me talking, it’s Apollo Investment’s chief economist, who makes this argument clearly with a slew of charts. Let me just share what I think is the most important point. If Americans’ fear about their jobs is declining and well off earlier peaks (see the far right side of the above chart), we’re far from a situation where this harms the economy. I’m not saying that will never happen—just that it isn’t coming soon. Moreover, a recent study has shown AI isn’t taking jobs. “The labor market doesn’t feel great, so it feels correct that AI is taking people’s jobs,” says Martha Gimbel, one of the Yale academics who authored the study. “But we’ve looked at this many, many different ways, and we really cannot find any sign that this is happening.” So, what is happening? In short, AI is boosting corporate profits. Over the long-term, we’ve seen earnings growth on a steady upward track, with the pandemic breaking that trend. But setting that aside, we’re back on that trend. In part, that’s thanks to things getting back to normal (hence the big jump in late 2021 and early 2022), but it’s also partly due to the 10% earnings rise in the past year, far above the 6.7% annual earnings growth of the S&P 500 over the last 50 years. In other words, stocks are rising more now because profits are doing the same, and technology will likely cause that trend to continue. Nonetheless, if you’re still concerned we’re in a bubble, I have a solution: a closed-end fund (CEF) that sells covered-call options. Under these deals, the fund sells investors the right to buy its stocks when they hit a certain price at a fixed future date. No matter what happens, the fund keeps the fee it charges for this and uses it to fund its dividend. It’s a strategy that does best in volatile markets. So if you hold a fund that invests in the S&P 500 broadly, you have a nice setup for gains in an up market and a bit of a hedge in a down one—say if we do see some short-term correction around AI. That leads us to the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), which yields 7.7%—handing us a nice “cash cushion” in the form of that high dividend. It also owns the S&P 500, so you’re getting a nice mix of large cap AI players, like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), and those that benefit from AI, like Visa (V). The problem with the covered-call strategy is that it can cap our upside in the long run, as the fund’s best stocks are sold, or “called away.” That’s why I prefer the 8.2%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a “pure” equity CEF that’s a holding in my CEF Insider service. This one not only has a strong long-term track record (it’s up over 200% in the last decade, including dividends) but has both increased regular payouts and paid out some huge special dividends, too. Sure, that dividend does float a bit, but that’s because it’s tied to the fund’s underlying performance. It’s actually a good setup as it gives management latitude to reinvest its profits without worrying about being tied to a fixed payout. That, in turn, drives further upside for us. Moreover, as I write this, ASG trades at an 8.2% discount to NAV, which is much more generous than its historical average of 2.2%. That puts additional upside (beyond the stock market’s future gains) on the table as that discount returns to normal. It’s a sweet setup that lets us ride further AI gains and grab big dividends, too—something those who limit themselves to mainstream AI stocks simply can’t get.

By Byron King PostedOctober 14, 2025 Legend has it that in November 2004 Taylor Swift was “discovered” in Nashville. A youngster at the time, merely 14 years old, she was playing guitar and singing at the Bluebird Café when a music promoter heard her, took a look, and decided that this gal was going places. And as you surely know, today she’s a huge mega-star. Taylor Swift in Nashville, but no I didn’t see her. Courtesy billboard.com. Well, I was in Nashville too, last week in fact. But sorry to say, I didn’t see Taylor Swift, nor did I discover any future big-time songstresses. Indeed, I didn’t even hit the music scene. Because I was busy. I was on the company clock at a Paradigm Press event at Nashville’s Renaissance Hotel; me, numerous colleagues, a bunch of audiovisual bubbas, and about 800 guests. We all came together to discuss U.S. and global markets, particularly with respect to precious metals, other critical metals, technology, biotech, crypto, macro trends and much more. Many things are booming in the markets, with some offering “Swift” returns just now, if you’ll excuse the pun, and the numbers are eye-popping (see below). So, I’ll leave singing to Taylor Swift and instead discuss a few things that I heard in Nashville about making money. And really; some of the investment ideas from Nashville could possibly go “Taylor Swift” upside on you if things play out. Let’s dig in… I’ll begin with what I heard from a colleague and friend Ray Blanco, our resident tech and biotech guru. How good is Ray? Well, he (humbly) reminded us of how in 2015 he recommended a then-modest chipmaking company called Nvidia (NVDA); yes, that one. When you adjust for splits, Ray’s 2015 entry price was $0.50 per share; and consider that today’s bid/ask for Nvidia is over $188. In other words, in the past decade Ray delivered readers a gain of over 37,500%. And yes, you are reading that number correctly. Which means that Ray has minted more than a few multimillionaires if they held their original shares, or even if they sold off fractions of their holding on the way up. Ray explained how he did it, and it began with a tech conference in Las Vegas in 2015. There, he took a hard look at Nvidia when the company’s brand emphasized its specialized chips for video gaming consoles. Back then, gaming and gamers were kind of a geeky niche market, but Ray discerned that the same processing capability that delivers game-quality video might transfer over to other areas. And this led to his Nvidia recommendation. As events unfolded, it turned out that Nvidia chips could process immensely large data streams. Thus, Nvidia’s chips were particularly useful for crypto mining, and more recently for massive bit-crunching that goes on with artificial intelligence (AI). And so, Nvidia leads the tech charge these days, and boasts a market cap over $4.5 trillion (yes, trillion with a “t”). Hmm… Kind of a Taylor Swift story, when you think about it. Having established his cred, Ray went on to discuss what he has up his sleeve now. The short answer is that Ray sees a massive robot revolution coming to America. Indeed, Ray envisions America’s old Rust Belt transforming into a “Robot Belt.” It’s in the beginning phases and rapidly ramping up big-time as Ray looks out five to ten more years. Ray foresees robots coming to job sites almost everywhere, from office work to stores and warehouses, factories, farms, mines, mills and more. And Ray explained how the rise of robots will dovetail nicely with American demographics, considering the aging Baby Boomers and how the trend is to replace people in jobs that are repetitive and boring if not physically dangerous. In one example of the robotic future, Ray showed an astonishing video of an AI-controlled farm implement that navigates through plowed fields, a self-driving robot-tractor, so to speak. It identifies weeds with advanced optics and zaps them with a laser beam. This beast can work all day, and even at night because of its night-vision capabilities. In essence, this machine – truly a system of systems – will make farming way more efficient, and also eliminate the need for quite a lot of agricultural chemicals currently in use. And absent the agrichemicals, it’ll lead to healthier food in general. Of course, China too is building its own versions of robot workers, factories, etc., and the Chinese are aggressive. So obviously, the U.S. must compete hard to make things work out for our own economy. And along these lines, Ray laid out several investable non-Chinese opportunities in the robot arena. Meanwhile in Nashville, many of us were watching the charts, but not for Taylor Swift’s latest album. No, we were watching as the price of gold popped over $4,000 per ounce, while silver hit the $50 level. Clearly, something is going on. I learned long ago, in geochemistry class at Harvard (back at “that” Harvard, not the current one), that gold and silver atoms don’t change over time. Indeed, elements like gold and silver are formed in stellar supernovae, and to all intent and purpose are immutable. In other words, the metals don’t change, but their rising price reflects the fall in value of our currency, created and controlled by not-so-cosmic forces in Washington, D.C. And then this week, as the newly reinaugurated Columbus Day holiday unfolded, gold broke over $4,100 and silver crossed above $52; and yes, these prices can bounce around, up and down, but the trend is clear: up-up-up for metals and down-down-down for dollars. As I’ve noted many times, the chief driver for rising gold prices over the past three years was buying by central banks that want to de-risk from holding dollars, definitely in a world of mercurial U.S. politics and sanctions. On the silver side, one key driver for rising prices has been global-scale industrial demand, particularly for more and more use in electronics and solar panels. One way or another, these demand forces push against supply, whether it’s new metal out of the mine pits, or from recycling what’s already here. Another angle on this rising trend for precious metal has to do with “paper” gold and silver, namely the worldwide trading system that pretends to sell metal but is actually just an elaborate gambling pit. That is, most precious metal trading has nothing to do with the metal; it’s all about buying or selling a claim on gold and silver bars that never leave the bullion bank. Except that… well, whoops! We currently have a massive imbalance between “paper” metal and the physical version, and this has created pressure within the physical supply chain. People, businesses and even governments are actually doing what’s called “standing for delivery” for precious metal from bullion banks, which in turn must come up with real ounces to wheel out onto the loading dock. With silver, for example, bullion banks have set themselves up with short positions on paper product; i.e., they sold claims on ounces that do not exist. And now, claimants want the metal but it’s not down in the vault. Indeed, we have far more claims via paper silver ounces than there are physical metal ounces available for delivery. And those delivery requests are surging, which is leading to a collapse in inventories. Looking ahead, markets appear to anticipate a breakout of “failures to deliver,” which will wreck confidence in the pricing structure. And thus, we’re on a trend that could lead to $100 an ounce for silver before year-end. This is what happens when markets become overly financialized, when leverage meets absolute scarcity in an environment of “panic.” That is, when just about everybody with a claim shows up at the same time to demand fulfillment on the underlying promise. I could go on with these points, but I want to switch over and discuss the mining side. Gold and silver prices are rising, which is easy to see at a glance. But what about the mining sector? Well, in general share prices for miners lag the rate of rise in the product they produce. Or look at it this way. Mining companies have an asset called an ore deposit in the ground, and they mine rock, process ore, and refine their material into mineral concentrates, if not produce actual gold or silver. And they carefully calculate costs along the way. Let’s say that in 2022, it cost a company $1,500 to mine an ounce of gold, and the metal sold for, say, $2,000 per ounce, a profit of $500. Okay, great. But now in 2025, let’s say that mining that same ounce of gold costs $2,100 (yes, inflation in labor, materials, energy, etc.), but the sales price is $4,100. Well, the profit has quadrupled from $500 to $2,000, or 4x what it was just a couple of years ago. Here’s a chart to help visualize things. Mining has become a cash machine. Courtesy Mr. Uppy on X/Twitter. In other words, miners in general are looking at serious cash flow benefits from gold and silver, not to mention better days ahead for whatever else comes out of the pits associated with precious metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, nickel and much more, depending on the geology. Looking ahead, if mining companies can keep their costs under control, and the price of energy stays reasonable (eg., oil prices don’t explode upwards), we should see superb cash flows and margins across the sector. And that will attract more and more investors who are currently fixated on the tech vaporware bubble. In other words, if you already own miners then good for you. If you don’t own them, you had better get on the train because it’s moving out of the station. Or stated another way… The mining sector is about to go all Taylor Swift on us. There’s more to say, but that’s enough for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

Title: What’s Behind The 40% Rise In META Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/whats-behind-the-40-rise-in-meta-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:53:29Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META’s stock has seen a solid 43% rise in the last six months. This growth is primarily fueled by a mix of factors, including upbeat quarterly performance and significant AI investments that boosted the core advertising business, leading to a rise in ad impressions and ad prices. Furthermore, rising user engagement across its apps contributed to investor optimism, all while the company returned capital to shareholders via $9.76 billion in share repurchases and $1.33 billion in dividend payments in Q2 alone. From a quantitative perspective, the 43% surge in Meta Platforms stock in the last six months was largely driven by a 33.5% change in the company's P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let's first dissect the stock price movement into its contributing factors. Investing in a single stock can be fraught with risk, but there is substantial benefit to a more diversified strategy, like the one we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about the potential long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Returning to the “change”: The alterations in fundamental aspects like valuation, revenue, and margins carry with them a narrative related to business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed significant developments that impacted the stock price movements for META stock. As a quick background: META offers products that allow users to connect and share through various devices, including mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere. Opinion: Currently, we view META stock as fairly valued. Why is that the case? Take a look at the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell META Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, META is not immune to significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 correction, 35% amid the Covid pandemic, and sustained a heavier blow of 77% during the inflation crisis. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, real risks remain. When markets sour, META can still experience serious downturns. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly given the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of surpassing the S&P 500 during the past 4-year period. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a steadier performance, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/avgo-stock-ai-jackpot-51b-shareholder-returns/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Buy CRWD Stock At $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has climbed 12% over the past month, fueled by optimism following its mid-September investor day. At that event, the company issued long-term guidance that exceeded analyst expectations, projecting net new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth of at least 20% in fiscal year 2027 and setting a target of $10 billion in ARR by FY2031. Given this strong guidance and the company’s robust operating performance and financial condition, we believe there isn’t much to worry about regarding CRWD stock. The primary concern, however, is its very high valuation, which makes the stock seem relatively expensive following the recent run-up. Here is our multi-factor evaluation to determine if it’s still a buy. That is one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Let’s delve into details of each of the evaluated factors, but prior to that, for quick background: With $127 Bil in market cap, CrowdStrike offers cloud-delivered security for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and cloud modules via direct sales and channel partners. This table illustrates how CRWD is valued compared to the broader market. For further details see: CRWD Valuation Ratios This table shows how CRWD is growing relative to the broader market. For additional details see: CRWD Revenue Comparison This table highlights how CRWD's profitability compares to the broader market. For more details see: CRWD Operating Income Comparison CRWD experienced an effect slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We determine this based on both (a) how considerably the stock declined and, (b) how swiftly it recovered. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook.

Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?

Full Content:
Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Broadcom Stock Retreats After Soaring on OpenAI Deal—Monitor These Key Price Levels

Full Content:
Broadcom (AVGO) shares dropped Tuesday morning, giving back a portion of the big gains posted yesterday following news that the chip giant had forged a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company said it would collaborate with OpenAI on the development of artificial intelligence accelerator and network systems for delivery from 2026 to 2029. The announcement comes just a week after rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) inked a deal with the San Francisco-based AI start-up. Broadcom shares were down nearly 4% at around $343 in recent trading, tracking a broader move lower for U.S. equities, after surging 10% on Monday. Investors have bid up the stock, which has risen about 50% since the start of the year, amid surging demand for custom AI chips as enterprises build out their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Broadcom’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting their all-time high last month, Broadcom shares retraced toward the 50-day moving average (MA) before attracting buying interest near the respected indicator. Buying in the stock accelerated yesterday on the highest trading volume in over a month, a move that also coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) reclaiming the 50 threshold to signal a return of bullish price momentum. Let’s point out two key overhead areas to watch on Broadcom’s chart and also identify important support levels worth monitoring during profit-taking episodes. Buying from current levels could initially see a move up to around $374. Tactical traders who have bought the recent pullback may look to lock in profits in this location near the stock’s record high, especially if the RSI simultaneously moves into overbought territory. If the shares enter price discovery mode, investors can forecast a possible overhead target to watch by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior price action to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to Broadcom’s chart, we take the uptrend from late August to early September and reposition it from last month’s low. This forecasts a bullish target of around $415, implying 16% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior move as it followed an earlier dip to the 50-day-MA in August, providing clues as to how a new trend higher from the indicator may take shape if price action rhymes. The first support level worth monitoring sits around $324. This area on the chart could attract buying interest near the September and October lows, which currently closely align with the rising 50-day MA. Finally, selling below this important level could spark a more significant drop to the $291 level. Investors could look to accumulate Broadcom shares in this region near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between July and September.

Title: Stock market ‘concentration risk’ now higher than dot-com bubble period, IMF warns
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/14/stock-market-concentration-risk-now-higher-than-dot-com-bubble-period-imf-warns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T14:15:00Z
Full Content:
Market valuations have “become stretched”, increasing the probably of a “disorderly correction”, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest Global Financial Stability update, published alongside its half-year report on the global economy, the Washington-based fund highlights the concentration risk within the US’s S&P 500 index from the so-called magnificent seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia). It noted that the information technology sector accounted for a weight of 35 per cent of the total S&P 500, similar to during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, but this time just seven stocks accounted for 33 per cent of the index. That meant the concentration risk “was now substantially higher than during the dot-com bubble”. Many analysts believe stock markets, particularly in the US, are on the brink of major negative correction following an investment glut in artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related companies have accounted for around 80 per cent of US stock market gains this year. [ Negative impact of tariffs starting to show, IMF warnsOpens in new window ] In its report, the IMF said the rebound in global equity prices since US president Donald Trump’s April tariff announcement had outpaced expected future earnings. Despite recent economic data trending negative, markets appear to be downplaying the potential effects of US tariffs on growth and inflation, it said. Global financial markets “have largely brushed off subsequent shocks and uncertainties,” it said, noting financial conditions across most regions have eased back to “accommodative levels”. But it warned “the apparent calm masks a degree of complacency.” “Despite trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and rising concerns about sovereign indebtedness, asset prices have returned to stretched valuations and financial conditions have broadly eased,” it said. “Against substantial AI-related investments, the possibility of mega-cap stocks failing to generate expected returns to justify current lofty equity valuations could trigger deterioration in investor sentiment and make the stocks susceptible to sudden, sharp correction,” the IMF said. An analysis of sovereign bond markets also highlighted “growing pressure from widening fiscal deficits on the functioning of markets,” it said. [ Why is the US economy so much stronger than Europe’s?Opens in new window ] In advanced economies, sovereign bond markets are increasingly dependent on price-sensitive investors, it said. “Stress in core bond markets, although a tail risk, could have broad and disruptive ramifications for financial markets, given bonds’ role as key benchmarks and collateral,” it said. In its report, the IMF also highlighted the weakness of the US dollar “Overall, the dollar has depreciated by about 10 per cent so far this year against major currencies,” it said. “Analysts have put forth a number of possible drivers for dollar weakness, from a revaluation of dollar strength amid concerns over the US fiscal position to a shift in allocation away from US-dollar-denominated assets driven by concerns about US policy uncertainty,” it said.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, October 13, stocks moved decisively higher, as seen in the S&P 500 rising 1.56%, the Dow 30 rising 1.29%, and the Nasdaq 100 rising 2.18%. Most stocks saw buying, though some stocks missed out. The following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the highest returns on the last trading day: On the other hand, the following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the lowest returns: Why does this matter? Significant stock moves - up or down - deserve your attention. Sharp declines in fundamentally strong names can offer smart buying opportunities. And when momentum aligns with solid fundamentals, riding the trend can be highly rewarding. In above, we find Humana (HUM) Attractive while Broadcom (AVGO) looks Attractive but Volatile. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Analysing over the last one week (5 trading days), weakness was evident in the S&P 500 falling 1.27%, the Dow 30 falling 1.34%, and the Nasdaq 100 falling 0.91%. The pullback was broad, but select names remained resilient. The following table shows the list of 10 stocks that generated the highest returns over the last week: Similarly, the following table shows the 10 stocks that were at the bottom in terms of returns: On a slightly wider timeline over the last one month, stocks moved decisively higher, as seen in the S&P 500 rising 1.07%, the Dow 30 rising 0.51%, and the Nasdaq 100 rising 2.73%. Most stocks saw buying, though some stocks missed out. The following table shows the 10 stocks that generated the maximum returns over the last one month: In the same period, these 10 stocks were at the bottom in terms of returns: Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Sell RKLB Stock At $65?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock has garnered considerable investor interest in 2025, climbing over 150% year-to-date. Trading at about $65, this extraordinary surge reflects an increasing optimism surrounding the company’s Neutron rocket program and its growing involvement in the commercial space sector. Nevertheless, under this excitement lies a valuation dilemma: the company is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 66.5x—more than twenty times the S&P 500’s 3.2x multiple. For investors contemplating entry at these levels, the pivotal question is whether this momentum is supported by fundamentals or primarily fueled by speculation regarding future prospects. Based on traditional valuation metrics, this premium seems challenging to rationalize. We’ll explore the company’s financials in the sections that follow. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like RKLB, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they avoided the drastic fluctuations, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? The company’s financial profile exposes stark inconsistencies: Despite its unprofitability, Rocket Lab possesses a strong balance sheet that allows them to pursue growth investments: The stock has shown moderate resilience amid market volatility. While it dropped 82.8% during the 2022 inflation crisis (more severe than the S&P 500’s 25.4% decline), it rebounded to pre-crisis levels by November 2024 and has since continued to rise. See more – Buy or Sell RKLB Stock? Our evaluation focuses on past performance and current fundamentals, which suggest RKLB is overvalued. Nonetheless, we may be mistaken in this evaluation, and investors might be inclined to accept a higher valuation multiple for the stock’s future potential, especially concerning the Neutron rocket program. The Neutron rocket signifies a strategic advancement into the medium-lift launch market, potentially positioning the company to compete more effectively with SpaceX’s Falcon 9. If this program succeeds, it could significantly enlarge Rocket Lab’s addressable market and alter its financial dynamics. The company’s solid balance sheet offers the financial endurance to realize this vision without immediate pressure for profitability. That being said, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Rocket Lab is deemed expensive when assessed against present operations—a company losing nearly 46 cents for every dollar of revenue while being valued at 66.5x sales. For investors concentrated on traditional value metrics, this introduces considerable downside risk. Nonetheless, for those who have faith in the company’s technological prowess and the transformative potential of its Neutron program, the existing valuation may signify fair compensation for engaging in the commercial space industry's growth trajectory. Ultimately, the investment decision rests on whether one is acquiring historical performance or prospective opportunities.

Title: How JOBY Stock Falls To $3?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/how-joby-stock-falls-to-3/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T13:33:45Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Joby Aviation stock (NYSE: JOBY) has captivated Wall Street with its vision of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft transforming urban transportation. The stock has experienced a remarkable rise, increasing by over 200% from under $6 a year ago to approximately $17 now. What’s driving the excitement? It’s a blend of future mobility enthusiasm and momentum. Firstly, there’s the overarching narrative of electric vehicles and sustainable transportation that has taken the markets by storm. Secondly, the concept of the “flying taxi” has investors envisioning a sci-fi future coming true. Thirdly, Joby has been making strategic advancements – forming partnerships with major entities like Delta Air Lines and Toyota, reaching certification milestones, and generating news that maintains the excitement. The firm has positioned itself as a leader in the burgeoning eVTOL market, announcing progress on FAA certification and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. However, here’s the sobering reality – while electric air taxis appear to be the future, that future is still years away from significant commercial operations and generating revenue. Joby continues to be a pre-revenue entity, depleting cash reserves as it strives for certification and commercialization. Naturally, it’s incurring losses – aerospace development is one of the most capital-intensive industries. For context, the company's operating cash flows were -448 million, with an operating loss of $638 million in the previous twelve-month period. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like JOBY, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has yielded returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What’s the reason for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? We agree that next-generation mobility stocks are focused on future growth, and the potential market for urban air mobility is vast. See our perspective on – Why Archer Aviation Is Positioned To Become The Uber of Air Travel. However, have you ever considered the downside risks? Think about it logically. There are numerous risks that could undermine Joby’s stock growth, and when things go awry, such speculative stocks don’t just dip – they plunge. This isn’t merely a theory. Let’s examine what occurred with JOBY during the inflation shock of 2022 when the Fed raised interest rates aggressively. The stock plummeted a staggering 79.7% from its peak of $15.70 in February 2021 to $3.18 by December 2022, while the S&P 500 fell only 25.4% from peak to trough. Consider that for a moment – JOBY dropped more than three times worse than the overall market. This highlights the distinction between speculative pre-revenue stocks and genuine businesses with real cash flows and profits. Yes, the stock regained its pre-crisis peak by July 2025 and even climbed to $20.39 in August, but that recovery took place during one of the most favorable environments for risk assets. What will occur when the cycle flips again? So what’s the actual downside risk for JOBY stock from its current price of $16.80? If history serves as a guide, it’s a possible decrease of approximately 80% or more, bringing the stock back to the $3-4 range. Are you ready for it? This isn’t fearmongering about JOBY – it's what transpired in 2022. The stock plummeted 80% from its peak to trough. And the fundamental risk profile hasn’t changed significantly. The company is still pre-revenue, still experiencing cash burn, now facing substantial dilution from the $500 million equity raise, still years away from significant commercialization, and primarily trading based on hope and future potential instead of current business fundamentals. The next time markets experience a risk-off scenario – be it due to inflation, recession, geopolitical crises, or any other shock – high-flying pre-revenue stocks often lead the decline. An 80% drop from current levels would bring JOBY to around $3.36, uncannily close to where it hit bottom in December 2022. If this level of risk makes you anxious, you might want to consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an effective way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The intent of this analysis is to inform investors of the actual downside risk associated with JOBY stock. It may or may not occur. However, the risk is undoubtedly substantial. The firm remains pre-revenue in one of the most capital-intensive and heavily regulated industries in the world. The recent $500 million equity raise – while prolonging the cash runway – significantly dilutes existing shareholders and emphasizes that commercialization and profitability are still aspirations. Understand that you are not investing in a profitable business; you are betting on eVTOL technology receiving certification, gaining public acceptance, achieving profitable operational scale, and Joby emerging victorious in a market characterized by fierce competition from well-capitalized rivals. Ultimately, it boils down to whether you can tolerate what the downside volatility might resemble if matters don’t unfold as anticipated with Joby. An 80% drawdown isn’t hypothetical – it has already occurred once. The question isn’t whether JOBY can decline that much again. The inquiry is: when the next market shock hits, are you ready to see your investment possibly drop by 80% or more?

Title: Netflix Stock Up 70% In 12 Months - What Drove It?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From quantitative point of view, The 68.7% change in Netflix (NFLX) stock from 10/13/2024 to 10/13/2025 was primarily driven by a 25.8% change in the company’s Net Income Margin (%). There is more to this story than just numbers, but first, let's break down the stock price movement into its contributing factors. That is one way to look at stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates much more, and is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for NFLX stock. Before that, as a quick background: NFLX provides TV series, documentaries, films, and mobile games in multiple genres and languages to over 222 million paid members across 190 countries. Opinion: We currently find NFLX stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell NFLX Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Netflix isn’t immune to big sell-offs. It plunged about 56% in the Global Financial Crisis and took a 44% hit in the 2018 correction. During the Covid pandemic, the drop was smaller but still notable at 23%. The worst was the inflation shock, where it fell close to 76%. So even with solid growth and a strong brand, NFLX can get hit hard when the market shakes. Quality cushions the fall but doesn’t fully prevent steep losses. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Markets Set For Lower Open As China Conflict Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rebounded Monday but poised to open lower Tuesday as the trade conflict with China continues. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 have dipped 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 1.2% lower and Dow Jones futures are down 0.6%. The back-and-forth of stock prices tracks with the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs after China restricted the export of rare earth minerals last week. Trump then walked back his aggressive tone, assuring the public in a Truth Social post that the trade disagreement was resolvable. Tuesday, China sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of a South Korean shipmaker. After trade tensions flared last week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to $21.99 from $17.09. The index retreated to a still-elevated level of $19.03 before eclipsing $21 again. The VIX Index quantifies market expectations for near-term volatility, based on S&P 500 option prices. On the inflation front, a new analysis by Goldman Sachs concludes that U.S. tariffs will raise prices by year-end. According to a research note summarized by the LA Times, analysts said U.S. consumers will probably absorb 55% of tariff costs while American companies pay 22%. Only 18% of tariff costs were projected to hit foreign exporters. If the projections prove accurate, the Federal Reserve’s job of stimulating jobs while managing inflation could get complicated. Earnings season begins Tuesday with scheduled reports from JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Blackrock, and others. Third quarter reports will demonstrate how corporate profits are trending amid the unique circumstances in 2025. Themes to watch include: What is a good P/S ratio? The price-to-sales or P/S ratio is a metric investors use to evaluate a company’s stock price. It is particularly useful for companies that aren’t profitable because you can calculate it without positive earnings. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S requires context to interpret. A low P/S ratio could mean the company is undervalued or that investors are not confident in the company’s future. A high P/S indicates investors are willing to pay more for the company’s sales—which is good when the company lives into the optimism, and bad when it does not. You can calculate the P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its revenue over the last 12 months. Alternatively, you can calculate a forward P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its expected revenue over the next 12 months. The two calculations quantify what investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company’s previous or expected sales. The P/S ratio is most valuable in comparisons. You can compare a P/S ratio to: Lower P/S ratios are generally associated with lower growth expectations, while higher P/S ratios imply more optimistic growth expectations. And this makes sense: The standard P/S calculation uses a sales figure that’s already happened, but investors make trading decisions on their future predictions. If investors expect next year’s sales to be, say, 50% higher, they’ll accept a higher stock price. Mathematically, a higher stock price increases the market capitalization which raises the P/S ratio. This is why fast-growing industries, like technology, have higher P/S ratios than more predictable industries such as utilities. Value investors prefer P/S ratios below 1 or no higher than 2, assuming the company has a fundamentally productive business model and healthy balance sheet. Growth investors tolerate or even gravitate towards higher P/S ratios because they can signal outperformance relative to peers. These P/S ratios as of Oct. 10, 2025, demonstrate how this metric can vary dramatically by business and industry. The average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is 3.17.

Stock futures and bitcoin are sliding this morning, while gold continues hitting new highs, as investors keep an eye on developments related to trade tensions with China and await a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; quarterly results from major U.S. banks are coming in better than analysts had anticipated; GM shares are down after the automaker revealed a $1.6 billion charge over weakness in its EV business; and shares of rare earth miners continue surging following China’s announcement of trade restrictions on the high-tech materials. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open after major indexes rebounded Monday from a steep downturn to close out last week, as concerns linger about trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies. Investors this morning are digesting earnings reports from major banks and are awaiting remarks from Fed Chair Powell, who is due to speak this afternoon on the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.7% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq dropped 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. Bitcoin was also down sharply after yesterday's rally, sliding to $111,300 in recent trading from an overnight high of around $116,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, fell to 4.02%, its lowest level in a month. Precious metals continue rising as many investors turn to safe-haven assets amid increasing stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Gold futures were up 0.4% at $4,150 an ounce in recent trading, after hitting a record high of just under $4,200 earlier in the session. (Read here about how the surge in gold prices—the price of the precious metal is up nearly 60% since the start of the year—is leading a growing number consumers to sell gold jewelry, coins and other items.) Silver futures were also trading at an all-time high this morning, rising slightly to around $50.50 an ounce. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported better-than-expected earnings as the banking giant led a string of reports from major financial institutions. JPMorgan shares were up slightly in premarket trading after the bank reported a 9% rise in revenue and a 12% jump in profits as increased stock trading helped boost the results. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose 3% ahead of the bell after the bank reported strong net interest income and raised its profitability target. Goldman Sachs (GS) also reported revenue and earnings that came in ahead of expectations, though its shares dropped about 2.5%. Citigroup (C) shares were up 1% after its results beat estimates. General Motors (GM) said that its quarterly earnings next week will include a $1.6 billion charge associated with its electric vehicle business. The move comes after the U.S. ended its $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the automaker said in a filing. GM shares were down about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of U.S. rare earth mineral mining firms continued to gain in premarket trading after China threatened to restrict exports of the materials that are critical for high tech products. Shares of USA Rare Earth (USAR) were up 12% after gaining 19% yesterday. MP Materials (MP) shares were up 7% ahead of the bell, after soaring 21% in the prior session.

Title: From code to concrete: The new TCS playbook to build factories that power AI

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/Bengaluru: There was no high-decibel government event, or even an investor roadshow. The message was tucked inside K. Krithivasan’s prepared remarks, in a recent media release. India’s largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the company Krithivasan now heads, is preparing for the biggest gamble of its five-decade existence: a massive $6.5 billion investment over six years to forge one gigawatt (GW) of new data centre capacity. Consider the sheer scale of ambition for a moment: This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base within six years, and the capital expenditure eclipses the combined value of all TCS acquisitions over the last two decades. That ambition also underlies a tectonic shift within TCS. For decades, the company exported code and consultancy, intangible services that powered global enterprises but left few physical footprints at home. Now, it is choosing to pour billions into concrete, steel and copper. The country’s most profitable IT exporter is turning inward, betting that India’s artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would need not just algorithms, but infrastructure. That shift is particularly striking given the group’s own history. Back in 2016, another Tata company, Tata Communications, effectively jettisoned its data centre play, deeming it “non-core." The sister concern sold 74% stake in its data centre business to a Temasek Holdings unit for $634 million. Three of those data centres were in Singapore; the rest across India. By last year, Tata Communications had divested its remaining 26%. Under chairman Cyrus Mistry, it seemed the group had moved on from the brick-and-mortar complexities of digital infrastructure. Under N. Chandrasekaran—the man who once put TCS on a high growth orbit—the pendulum has violently swung back. So when Krithivasan—himself a quiet engineer who inherited the corner office after Rajesh Gopinathan’s abrupt exit in 2023—outlined this unprecedented investment, it was more than a capex announcement. It signalled a philosophical reversal within the Tata ecosystem, a return to building the physical foundations of digital India. “The Tata Group companies are in power, real estate, project management businesses…So, there is a different kind of synergy we can build in here," Krithivasan said, during a call with analysts on 9 October. The timing, though, came against an uneasy backdrop. Ahead of TCS’s latest earnings, on 9 October, its stock was languishing near a 52-week low. Growth was tapering. Analysts at Motilal Oswal and Nuvama projected a full-year revenue decline—the first since TCS’s 2004 listing. The mood across India’s $283-billion IT industry was sombre. Global clients were trimming technology budgets, US visa restrictions had upended the traditional onsite-offshore model, and TCS had just confirmed the layoff of over 6,000 employees in the September quarter. In this subdued climate, the $6.5 billion commitment stood out as an act of economic courage, an attempt to reimagine TCS’s future rather than merely defend its margins. TCS did not respond to Mint’s detailed questionnaire seeking comments. April at the TajThe idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity. The same month, at a high-profile event in Delhi’s Taj Mansingh Hotel, TCS unveiled its ‘sovereign cloud network’, a service designed to store and process data entirely within Indian borders in compliance with new data-localization rules. It was a logical extension of TCS’s IT services portfolio: the company already provided engineers, managed IT infrastructure, and offered private cloud services. What it lacked was real estate—the physical layer of computing power that anchored the digital world. View Full Image In April this year, TCS unveiled its sovereign cloud network. (iStockphoto) That gap is precisely what the new investment aims to close. Data centres are the factories of the AI age—vast, secure facilities that house the servers, networking equipment and cooling systems needed to process and store the petabytes of data generated every day. India’s regulatory mandates and digital explosion have created a perfect storm of demand. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, now requires payment data to be stored domestically; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, has similar stipulations for market participants. As 5G networks roll out and connected devices multiply, the volume of data produced by consumers, vehicles, and industrial systems is surging. Add the rise of generative AI, and the need for high-speed computing infrastructure becomes existential. TCS believes it can monetize this infrastructure in two ways: leasing capacity to hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and using it for its own contracts with governments and enterprises. The company’s first 150 MW facility, to be built at a cost of $1 billion, is expected to go live within 18 months. Different from AccentureThe move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity. The same month, at a high-profile event in Delhi’s Taj Mansingh Hotel, TCS unveiled its ‘sovereign cloud network’, a service designed to store and process data entirely within Indian borders in compliance with new data-localization rules. It was a logical extension of TCS’s IT services portfolio: the company already provided engineers, managed IT infrastructure, and offered private cloud services. What it lacked was real estate—the physical layer of computing power that anchored the digital world. That gap is precisely what the new investment aims to close. Data centres are the factories of the AI age—vast, secure facilities that house the servers, networking equipment and cooling systems needed to process and store the petabytes of data generated every day. India’s regulatory mandates and digital explosion have created a perfect storm of demand. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, now requires payment data to be stored domestically; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, has similar stipulations for market participants. As 5G networks roll out and connected devices multiply, the volume of data produced by consumers, vehicles, and industrial systems is surging. Add the rise of generative AI, and the need for high-speed computing infrastructure becomes existential. TCS believes it can monetize this infrastructure in two ways: leasing capacity to hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and using it for its own contracts with governments and enterprises. The company’s first 150 MW facility, to be built at a cost of $1 billion, is expected to go live within 18 months. Different from AccentureThe move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have."

From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance.

A broad-based selloff swept global stock markets this morning after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times that China “will be hurt the most” if it doesn’t submit to Washington’s trade demands. At the same time, China showed no signs of backing down from President Trump’s trade war: It imposed sanctions banning Chinese companies from doing business with the U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.63% on the news. S&P 500 futures were down 0.87% this morning. The index opened the better part of 1% lower almost immediately. Markets in Asia and Europe were almost all down, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 off 2.58% and Europe’s Stoxx 600 down 0.49% by midmorning. Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth materials—which the U.S. is dependent on—are “a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them,” Bessent said. “Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world,” he told the FT. “If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most. “They are in the middle of a recession/depression,” he added, “and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they’re exacerbating their standing in the world.” (China is, in fact, doing very well. Its exports rose 8.3% in September, and the World Bank expects China’s GDP to grow 4.8% this year. U.S. growth is forecast at 1.4%.) The mood among traders today is a stark reversal from yesterday, when the S&P 500 rose 1.56% after investors realized that Trump and China President Xi Jinping will likely meet at the upcoming APEC conference at the end of October—an opportunity for both men to reach one of Trump’s famous deals. Elsewhere, there wasn’t much to cheer up the markets. A third of bettors on Polymarket think the U.S. government shutdown will continue beyond Nov. 8. Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that consumer sentiment remains low: The University of Michigan’s consumer survey, which asks whether buyers feel now is a good time to make a major purchase, lately “points to year-over-year growth in this measure of core spending slowing to near-zero soon, a far cry from the 6% pace earlier this year,” according to Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen. Goldman Sachs added to the gloom by publishing a note this morning titled “Jobless growth.” “The modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead. We expect the great majority of U.S. potential GDP growth to come from solid productivity growth boosted by advances in artificial intelligence, with only a modest contribution from labor supply growth due to population aging and lower immigration,” authors Pierfrancesco Mei and David Mericle said. In the longer term, however, most analysts continue to see stocks going up, driven largely by the tech and AI sector. “Roughly half of this S&P 500 bull has been driven by just seven stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA),” Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial told clients in a note. But “the Fed is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, and inflation appears to be under control despite increased tariffs, likely eliminating that as a potential bull market killer.” Here’s a snapshot of the markets this morning:

Members Portal A pop quiz of trivia from the previous 19 years of Skeptoid shows! Can you beat the masters? Skeptoid Podcast #1010Filed under Feedback & Questions by Brian DunningOctober 14, 2025 Sponsor an episode! We've just celebrated the 19th birthday of Skeptoid — 19 straight years of weekly shows, and that's pretty cool. So experienced Skeptoid listeners know what that means for today's show: it's time for a pop quiz, with one question from each of the previous 19 years. And no, you don't have to have listened to every show for that long; you just need a good solid foundation of science literacy and critical thinking. Which obviously you have — or you wouldn't be a Skeptoid listener! Keep track of your score; we're going to give you a ranking at the end. So here we go. If you're listening with someone and find yourselves needing a moment to confer after any question, then you are encouraged to push the pause button and deliberate as long as necessary: Of the many pseudoscientific medical benefits professed by some sellers of wheatgrass juice is the false claim that drinking it can remove toxic heavy metals from your system. What medical procedure can actually do this? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, chelation therapy. A chelating agent such as EDTA is administered intravenously and bonds to the heavy metal, which can then be excreted through the urine. American journalist Michael Drosnin shocked the world in 1994 with the publication of The Bible Code, in which he announced that he'd found many historic events foretold in the Bible using a previously undiscovered hidden code. What relatively simple encoding method did he claim was used? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, Equidistant Letter Spacing. Pick a number, say 25, then take every 25th letter from a text. Those letters spell out your messages. Using computer programs, it's been found that virtually any short message you want can be found in virtually any long book-length text using this technique. Before this world's largest scientific instrument came online in 2010, crackpots everywhere were predicting that it would destroy the Earth, by either creating microscopic black holes, strangelets, or magnetic monopoles. It did not do any of those things — but it did help us discover the Higgs boson. Where is the collider located? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, CERN, just outside of Geneva. Fears among the scientifically illiterate became so widespread that lawsuits seeking court orders to stop CERN were filed worldwide. All failed, as none of the plaintiffs were knowledgeable enough to demonstrate any credible threat. Everyone in the country hates changing our clocks twice a year. So what is, in fact, the real reason that we torment ourselves with Daylight Saving Time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, shopping. In much of the country, it's cold for half the year so nobody goes out shopping in the evening anyway; but they do in the summer. Giving them one extra hour before the retailers' closing times means more sales are made and more tax revenue generated. Half of you are going to argue with me on this and say it's one of the others, but the official reasons can be found in my references. In 1966, the Department of Transportation (which is in charge of this for some reason) created the Uniform Time Act of 1966 which stated this as "Convenience of commerce." This region of high radiation, where the inner Van Allen radiation belt dips closest to Earth, got some publicity in 2009 when some blamed its effects for causing the crash of Air France flight 447. Which of the following is true about the South Atlantic Anomaly? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C. The closest the Anomaly dips to the Earth is about 200 km, at which point it's very small; and the highest flying airliners might get as high as 15 km. About 19 years after the Bounty mutineers settled on Pitcairn Island, the island was visited by the crew of an American whaling ship. How many of the British sailors still survived? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one: John Adams. Of the nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, eleven Tahitian women, and one baby who had landed there, only Adams and nine of the women still remained (plus nineteen children) — the others having been killed in fierce infighting. In 2008, a large double-blinded study was done with 21 contestants from the Eighth International Violin Competition using nine top quality violins, ranging from brand new instruments to multimillion-dollar classics including two Strads and a Guarneri (another Italian classic, contemporary to the Strads). The musicians tested exhaustively according to strict protocols in which they could neither clearly see nor smell the instruments they played. Which was the most preferred instrument? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, one of the new violins. The Stradivarius in the test that had the most illustrious history was the least preferred. For that most preferred new one, seven couldn't tell if it was old or new, seven wrongly guessed that it was old, and only three correctly guessed that it was new. Ganzfeld experiments are one type of test for psychic powers. How does this one work? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one person tries to visualize an object the other person is concentrating on. Proponents consistently claim a better-than-random-chance success rate; skeptics always find methodological errors like inadequate blinding and sensory leakage. When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay summited Mt. Everest for the first time in 1953, it was to some controversy; as many have long maintained that two other British men had succeeded first in 1924, yet died on their return. Who were they? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. If you guessed Eric Shipton, you were close; Shipton was a last-minute cut from Hillary and Norgay's famous 1953 expedition, but he'd been on most of the expeditions since the 1930s. He's best known for being the guy who faked a famous photo of a "yeti footprint" next to an ice axe for scale, which he did in 1951. In 1854, Sir John Franklin embarked upon his fourth and final polar voyage. Unfortunately it ended in disaster: both ships sank, nobody survived, and evidence remained that a few of the survivors may have resorted to cannibalism. Much of this evidence was discovered on what island? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Beechey Island in the Canadian Arctic. This voyage was to find a fabled Northwest Passage, a way to sail between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via an ice-free route through the Arctic Ocean across the top of North America, rather than having to go halfway round the world to traverse Cape Horn. So islands in the Canadian Arctic were the only possible correct answer. This small forested grove in Romania is only about 3 km². It was made famous to Americans in 2014 when a team of TV ghost hunters drove into it. One pretended to have an unprovoked panic attack. They brought along a commercially sold ghost hunting detector device, which detected nothing. They panicked and fled. While their contribution to the mythology was essentially meritless, they did bring up one case of a 5-year-old girl who went missing in the forest once. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, the area of the park is so small that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to go missing within it. Consequently there are no records of it ever having happened. The first emperor of a unified China left a lot to remember him by, not just the original Great Wall of China, but also his vast mausoleum complex, home to the Terra Cotta warriors, a vast map of the world in miniature complete with liquid mercury representing its oceans, and a massive central pyramid. Which of these three pyramids is the largest, by volume? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Qin Shi Huang's pyramid was indeed the biggest of these three, by volume. At 3.1 million m³, it was about 20% bigger than the Great Pyramid of Khufu at 2.6 million m³. Although Monk's Mound has about the same footprint as the Great Pyramid, it's only about a quarter the volume. The world's biggest is the Great Pyramid of Cholula in Mexico, at 4.5 million m³. The so-called Baghdad Battery is a small terra cotta pot discovered in 1936, probably between 1300 and 2200 years old. Its designation as a battery (which is obviously false) has come from alternative historians and ancient advanced culture theorists. What is it really? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B. It's essentially identical to many other scroll containers, many of which have been found with their scrolls intact. The giveaway is the residue of asphalt around its lip, which was used to seal such containers and preserve the scrolls within. If you visit the Catherine Palace south of St. Petersburg, you can go and visit a faithful replica of the fabulous Amber Room, gifted to Peter the Great in 1716 by King Frederick William I. The original was initially lost in World War II, during the scuffle to hide artworks and other treasures from the invading Nazis in 1941. What was ultimately its fate? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, it was destroyed when the advancing Red Army razed Königsberg Castle in Germany, burning it completely to the ground in 1944. The room had been on display there, and the German curators disassembled it and packed it into nondescript crates for evacuation — but it was too late. Unfortunately for the Soviets, the average infantryman knew or cared little about current developments in art history. It's reasonably well known that the Holy Grail became a part of Christian mythology after the Bible; it came from Arthurian lore. In what publication did the principal character Perceval make his first appearance, so far as we've been able to find? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, The Story of the Grail from 1190. Following Geoffery of Monmouth's book, the 1100s were full of pulp fan fiction about King Arthur, and it does appear that this poem is where Perceval and the Grail both made their debuts. Interestingly, it is incomplete, as its author literally died mid-sentence. And OK, yeah, this was probably too hard of a question. In 1959, Canada's magnificent Avro F-105 Arrow was inexplicably canceled. Only a few having been built, then immediately destroyed, the Arrow was the world's best and most advanced interceptor: capable of taking off, pursuing and overtaking enemy bombers, and shooting them down. The reason was that, with the advent of ICBMs, interceptors were simply no longer relevant. The conspiracy theories melt away when you note that an American interceptor concept, largely identical to the Arrow, was canceled at about the same time. What was it? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, the XF-108 Rapier, from North American. This is kind of an unfair question if you're not an aerospace nerd. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie was a bomber, not an interceptor; and the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar was a proposed spaceplane, a followup to the record-setting X-15. Yes, it had a dumb name, because it sounded like "dinosaur", but it was Dyna (like dynamite) and Soar (like fly). JPL co-founder Jack Parsons is somewhat notorious for his lifestyle outside of work, in which he led a chapter of a mysticism order from his large house in which some of the members lived, called the Parsonage. What future cult leader lived at the Parsonage for a time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, L. Ron Hubbard, who went on to found the Church of Scientology. Hubbard and Parsons' girlfriend, Sara "Betty" Northrup, ran off together with $10,000 of Parsons' money. Nibiru is said to be the name of a rogue planet that could swing past Earth at some point and cause massive destruction. Other stories surround the so-called Planet X. Planet X and Nibiru are not the same thing; both have distinct backstories and predictions associated with them. They could be purely fictional, or they could be theoretical, based on actual astronomical observations. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, Nibiru is fictional and Planet X is hypothetical. Nibiru was the brainchild of broad-spectrum wooist and alternative historian Zecharia Sitchin, who published it in a fact-free book series called The Earth Chronicles, which started with The 12th Planet in 1976. Planet X, on the other hand, was the name given by famed astronomer Percival Lowell to a hypothetical body that he (and others) believed would account for perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. For quite some time after his death, the subsequent discovery of Pluto was believed to account for this. That was later disproven, but only when the Voyager 2 mission made better measurements of Neptune's mass, many decades later. "Excited delirium" is a cause of death sometimes attributed to people who died being arrested, usually young black men. It is not a real medical diagnosis and its origin has been traced to the manufacturer of what police equipment? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, tasers. The condition was first described in a white paper published by the American College of Emergency Physicians, written by a task force, three of whose members were found to have been consultants paid by Taser International, since renamed Axon Enterprise. Some states are now banning "excited delirium" from being listed as a cause of death. OK, let's see how you did!

OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. Shares of Broadcom rose more than 10%. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. Most analysts do not expect the deal, the latest effort by a tech company to develop custom AI chips, to challenge Nvidia’s grip on the AI accelerator market, given the significant challenge of designing, scaling and manufacturing in-house chips from the ground up. The OpenAI-Broadcom deal is the latest in a string of massive chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry’s surging appetite for computing power as it races to build the most sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. A one-gigawatt data center can cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, adding that Nvidia products, powering the data center, can represent more than half of those costs. The 2026 timeline set out by OpenAI for the build-out is aggressive, but the startup is also best positioned to raise the funds required for the project, given the heights of investor confidence, said Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at eMarketer. “Financing such a large chip deal will likely require a combination of funding rounds, pre-orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft, as well as leveraging future revenue streams and potential credit facilities.” The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on costly, supply-constrained Nvidia processors. However, similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports. Still, the rise in demand for custom chips has turned Broadcom into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. Broadcom unveiled a $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer, which some analysts speculated was OpenAI. However, a company executive on Monday alluded that OpenAI was not that unnamed client. Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom’s Ethernet and other networking gear, challenging Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking solution. India has strongly condemned Pakistan’s recent military actions along the Afghan border, accusing Islamabad of sheltering and sponsoring terrorist organisations amid escalating tensions between the two neighbours. At a press briefing on Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also underlined New Delhi’s support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and independence.

A subscription may be required for some services. Share The pace of AI innovation is accelerating, and with the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we're reminded that turning this potential into enterprise reality requires a robust, open ecosystem built on choice and collaboration. Our goal has always been to provide a consistent, powerful platform for AI that works with any model, on any accelerator, and across the hybrid cloud. Today, we're thrilled to highlight the momentum from our partners, who are working alongside us to build out the future of open, hybrid AI on Red Hat. The Red Hat partner ecosystem is the engine that will deliver the generative AI (gen AI) and agentic capabilities that customers need for broad market adoption. It’s about bringing together the best in hardware, software, and services to create a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts. The launch of Red Hat AI 3 is centered on driving enterprise AI inference, expanding model choice and enabling open models for optimized cost and flexibility – so organizations can go from training to “doing.” And Red Hat partners play a critical role in making this happen. To deliver AI inference at scale using vLLM and Kubernetes, the llm-d open source project is now generally available as part of Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0, powered by a coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerators and premier AI cloud platforms. Founding contributors include CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research, and NVIDIA, with additional support from partners like AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda, and Mistral AI. Since the project’s introduction earlier this year, Microsoft, Oracle and WEKA have also become active contributing members. Nilesh Patel Chief Strategy Officer, WEKA As Large Language Models (LLMs) become the foundation for a wide range of gen AI applications, Red Hat is introducing the Partner Model Validation Guide to empower our partners and provide greater choice to customers. This guide outlines a standardized, step-by-step process for Red Hat partners to benchmark their LLMs for inclusion in the Red Hat OpenShift AI model catalog. Leveraging the Partner Model Validation Guide, model provider partners can generate the data needed for validation using a prescribed open source toolchain, including vLLM for serving, GuideLLM for performance benchmarking, and LM Evaluation Harness for accuracy evaluations. Once submitted and validated by our team, these partner models, complete with their performance and quality metrics, will be made visible and available to all Red Hat OpenShift AI customers. This initiative enriches our model catalog, offering customers more transparent insights and guidance at the model level, a broader selection of best-in-class open source models to build their AI applications, and market visibility for our model provider partners. Ultimately, the goal is to get AI applications into production where they can deliver business value. Red Hat AI, combined with our partner ecosystem, provides the essential capabilities for developing, deploying, and managing agentic AI. This is where our systems integrators and services partners play a crucial role. Red Hat is engaged with global leaders like Accenture, HCL, Kyndryl, IBM Consulting, Infosys and NTT DATA to support customers in scaling these applications and optimizing inference to run AI everywhere – from the datacenter to the edge. With a solid foundation and enabled infrastructure, the focus shifts to the tools and models that power intelligent applications. An AI strategy is only as good as the ecosystem of data platforms, vector databases, security tools, and developer utilities that support it. Red Hat’s partner landscape is rich and diverse, providing the essential components for building modern AI workflows. With the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we've curated a collection of MCP servers. This enables ISVs to connect their tools and services directly to Red Hat AI. Partners like CyberArk, Dynatrace, Elastic, EnterpriseDB, Palo Alto Networks, and others are working with Red Hat to showcase their MCP servers, helping customers build sophisticated agentic applications with trusted tools. Steve Kearns General Manager, Search Solutions, Elastic Wolfgang Heider Product Lead Software Delivery, Dynatrace Red Hat’s work with Meta’s open source Llama Stack is foundational to empowering developers with Red Hat AI 3. By actively contributing to this open source project, Red Hat and its partners are helping to enhance a complete set of standardized tools that revolutionize the gen AI application lifecycle. This helps ensure developers have a compelling, robust, and adaptable environment to accelerate the creation and deployment of innovative AI solutions, giving our partners and customers a clear path to production. By reducing the complexity of integrating various AI services and tools, Llama Stack enables developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure challenges. Options are important to cover the widest range of capabilities, which is why we've deepened our collaborations with accelerator partners like AMD, Google Cloud, and Intel. We’re working with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s performance-optimized AI computing, networking, and software with Red Hat AI, helping customers to build, deploy, and manage AI at scale and optimize infrastructure across diverse workloads. Red Hat and NVIDIA continue to drive the expansion of AI infrastructure with the support for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 infrastructure, targeting high-end AI training and inference at scale. Furthermore, the NVIDIA RTX PRO(R) 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs support Red Hat AI, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, accelerating a range of enterprise workloads, including enterprise AI and VDI graphics, with air-cooled GPUs and servers. Our collaboration with AMD is powering more efficient gen AI by enabling AMD’s portfolio of x86-based processors and GPUs on Red Hat AI, driven by our activations in upstream communities like vLLM and llm-d to deliver enhanced performance and GPU support. In addition, Red Hat continues to build upon its longstanding collaboration with Intel to support Red Hat AI across its expanding hardware platform and accelerator portfolio, including Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators. This commitment to choice extends across the hybrid cloud. In this area, we are actively working with Google Cloud to bolster TPU support on Red Hat AI, extending our shared vision for community-powered innovation through projects like llm-d and vLLM. But accelerators are just one piece of the puzzle. Customers need validated, integrated solutions. That's where our OEM server partners come in, transforming the theoretical potential of AI into tangible enterprise reality. While the foundation of AI lies in accelerators on the bottom and language models on the top, the practical deployment and management of AI at scale requires robust, integrated solutions. Red Hat is actively collaborating with industry leaders, including Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, and Lenovo, to simplify the deployment and management of AI across hybrid cloud environments. With Dell, we are working to help ensure that their powerful server and storage solutions are optimized for Red Hat AI, providing customers with reliable and scalable infrastructure for their AI workloads. This includes joint efforts to enable Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenShift AI for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, which brings together optimized hardware and software capabilities to drive more seamless AI deployments that can handle the most demanding computational tasks. Similarly, our collaboration with Cisco combines their strengths in networking, security, compute, and observability with Red Hat OpenShift as the application platform for containerized AI workloads within Cisco AI PODs, the core AI infrastructure building block of Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA. Red Hat AI builds on this foundation to deliver a consistent, automated environment for AI model development, training, and inferencing. The result is a full-stack AI platform that is scalable, high-performing and secure. We are expanding AI infrastructure reference designs and offerings across our entire infrastructure ecosystem.

Title: Carbon credits are failing to help with climate change — here’s why

Time Published: 2025-10-14T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets. Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions. Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later. Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions. Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets. Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes. Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes. Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits. Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects. Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1. It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset. In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3. Why the green-technology race might not save the planet Why the green-technology race might not save the planet For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk. Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity. These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence. Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10. Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes. Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax. or

Title: JPMorgan launches $10B tech, infrastructure investment initiative
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/13/jpmorgan-launches-10b-tech-infrastructure-investment-initiative/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T23:15:03Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 19:15 EDT / OCTOBER 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in technology and infrastructure companies. The news sent several quantum computer makers’ shares soaring more than 20%. JPMorgan will invest mainly in U.S. companies with the goal of supporting their engineering and manufacturing operations. The bank will make the investments as part of a new program, the Security and Resiliency Initiative, through which it plans to support “industries critical to national economic security and resiliency.” In addition to investing its own capital, the bank will provide participating companies with $1.5 trillion worth of financing over 10 years, 50% more than what it had planned to offer before. The Security and Resiliency Initiative will focus on 27 different areas that the bank has organized into four categories. The first category, which JPMorgan calls frontier and strategic technologies, includes five technology verticals including quantum computing. Shares of quantum computer developers D-Wave Quantum Inc. and IonQ Inc. rose more than 20% on the news, while Quantum Computing Inc. closed 12% higher. It’s possible JPMorgan’s interest in the quantum technology market isn’t limited solely to computers. The bank listed sensor hardware as a focus of its new investment initiative. Many of the most advanced sensors in development today use quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the behavior of low-temperature atoms, to detect environmental changes. IonQ, one of the quantum computer makers that logged stock price gains today, entered the quantum sensor market earlier this year. Alongside its frontier and strategic technologies category, JPMorgan plans to invest in three other areas. They include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace and energy independence and resilience. Those categories also include technology-related subfields. JPMorgan’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing investment plan, for example, will partly focus on companies developing autonomous mobile robots. The bank will also seek to back chipmaking equipment providers. In the energy sector, battery storage is among the technologies that JPMorgan lists as a priority. The Wall Street heavyweight will hire bankers, investment professionals and other experts to support its new financing initiative. It will also appoint an external advisory council to help guide the program. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy,” said JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “America needs more speed and investment.” Another major financial institution, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is also sharpening its focus on the tech sector. The investment bank today announced plans to acquire San Francisco-based venture capital firm Industry Ventures for $665 million in cash and equity. Goldman Sachs will pay an additional $300 million through 2030 if certain performance goals are met. Industry Ventures has 45 staffers who manage $7 billion worth of assets. The firm has backed Meta Platforms Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and other major consumer tech firms over the past 25 years. Its portfolio also includes enterprise software companies such as Datadog Inc., a publicly traded observability provider.

UPDATED 19:15 EDT / OCTOBER 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in technology and infrastructure companies. The news sent several quantum computer makers’ shares soaring more than 20%. JPMorgan will invest mainly in U.S. companies with the goal of supporting their engineering and manufacturing operations. The bank will make the investments as part of a new program, the Security and Resiliency Initiative, through which it plans to support “industries critical to national economic security and resiliency.” In addition to investing its own capital, the bank will provide participating companies with $1.5 trillion worth of financing over 10 years, 50% more than what it had planned to offer before. The Security and Resiliency Initiative will focus on 27 different areas that the bank has organized into four categories. The first category, which JPMorgan calls frontier and strategic technologies, includes five technology verticals including quantum computing. Shares of quantum computer developers D-Wave Quantum Inc. and IonQ Inc. rose more than 20% on the news, while Quantum Computing Inc. closed 12% higher. It’s possible JPMorgan’s interest in the quantum technology market isn’t limited solely to computers. The bank listed sensor hardware as a focus of its new investment initiative. Many of the most advanced sensors in development today use quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the behavior of low-temperature atoms, to detect environmental changes. IonQ, one of the quantum computer makers that logged stock price gains today, entered the quantum sensor market earlier this year. Alongside its frontier and strategic technologies category, JPMorgan plans to invest in three other areas. They include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace and energy independence and resilience. Those categories also include technology-related subfields. JPMorgan’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing investment plan, for example, will partly focus on companies developing autonomous mobile robots. The bank will also seek to back chipmaking equipment providers. In the energy sector, battery storage is among the technologies that JPMorgan lists as a priority. The Wall Street heavyweight will hire bankers, investment professionals and other experts to support its new financing initiative. It will also appoint an external advisory council to help guide the program. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy,” said JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “America needs more speed and investment.” Another major financial institution, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is also sharpening its focus on the tech sector. The investment bank today announced plans to acquire San Francisco-based venture capital firm Industry Ventures for $665 million in cash and equity. Goldman Sachs will pay an additional $300 million through 2030 if certain performance goals are met. Industry Ventures has 45 staffers who manage $7 billion worth of assets. The firm has backed Meta Platforms Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and other major consumer tech firms over the past 25 years. Its portfolio also includes enterprise software companies such as Datadog Inc., a publicly traded observability provider.

Semiconductor stocks gained ground Monday as China tariff concerns dissipated, while one chipmaker got a boost from a major artificial intelligence partnership announcement. Shares of casino operators fell as stormy weather dragged on gaming revenue in a key region. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back as President Donald Trump adopted a softer stance on trade relations with China and officials said the leaders of the two countries are still on track for an upcoming meeting. The S&P 500 jumped 1.6%. The Dow was up 1.3%, closing a bit above 46000, while the Nasdaq added 2.2%. For more Investopedia coverage of the day's major market stories, read here. Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged 9.9% after the chipmaker said it would collaborate with ChatGPT maker OpenAI on the development of artificial intelligence accelerator and network systems. The unveiling of Broadcom's partnership with the world's most valuable startup came a week after Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced its own OpenAI deal. Nvidia (NVDA) said that its ethernet networking switches would be incorporated into AI data centers by (META) and Oracle (ORCL). The competitive threat from the AI chip behemoth weighed on shares of data center switch provider Arista Networks (ANET), which sank 4.3%. Nvidia's shares ended the day 2.9% higher. Other semiconductor stocks gained ground Monday as concerns subsided about a possible intensification of U.S.-China trade tensions. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) jumped 4.9%, clawing back losses posted last week. Among the strongest performers were shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), which gained 9.6% and 8.5%, respectively. A lower percieved likelihood of increased tariffs on goods from China also helped drive a recovery in shares of companies that import a major portion of their products from the world's second-largest economy. Shares of electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) bounced about 10% Monday. Fastenal (FAST) shares fell 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the provider of industrial construction supplies missed expectations with its third-quarter earnings per share. An uptick in selling, general, and administrative costs weighed on profitability. The company said sluggish industrial production affected its performance but highlighted strength in its fastener product line. Casino operators came under pressure after a report revealed that September gross gaming revenue in Macau fell more than expected. The underperformance of the Asian gambling hotspot reflects a disruption caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa. Storm-related impacts to the region continued in early October, as Typhoon Matmo also resulting in closures and travel cancelations. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) shares were down 6.3%, while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) stock lost 6.2%.

Title: Is the AI Conveyor Belt of Capital About to Stop?

reading time 8 minutes The American economy is little more than a big bet on AI. Morgan Stanley investor Ruchir Sharma recently noted that money poured into AI investments now accounts for about 40% of the United Statesâ GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for 80% of growth in American stocks. So how bad is it that the most recent major deal among AI giants, agreements that have driven up stock prices dramatically, look like a snake eating its own tail? In recent months, Nvidia announced that it would invest $100 billion into OpenAI, OpenAI announced that it would pay $300 billion to Oracle for computing power, and Oracle announced it would buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia. It doesnât take a flow chart to get the feeling that these firms are just moving money around between each other. But surely thatâs not happeningâ¦right? Itâs a little harder to get assurances of that than you might think.Â Many of these agreements are, on their face, mutually beneficial. If everything is on the level, while these deals might be circular, they should be moving everything forward. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Gizmodo that deals like these could result in a âless capacity-constrained world,â which would allow for faster development of models that could produce higher returns on investment. âThe better models we have, the more we can realize a lot of these AI use cases that are on hold just because the technology isnât powerful enough yet to handle it,â he said. âIf that happens, and that can generate real [return on investment] for customers â¦ that results in real cost savings, potentially new revenue generation opportunities, and that creates net benefits from a GDP perspective.â So as long as we keep having AI breakthroughs and these companies figure out how to monetize their products, everything should be fine. On the off chance that doesnât happen, though?Â âIf that doesn’t happen, if there is no real enterprise AI adoption, then it’s all round-tripping,â Jaluria said. Round-tripping, generally speaking, refers to the unethical and typically illegal practice of making trades or transactions to artificially prop up a particular asset or company, making it look like itâs more valuable and in demand than it actually is. In this case, it would be tech companies that are trying to make it appear like they are more valuable than they actually are by announcing big deals with each other that move the stock price.Â So what might suggest whether this money is actually accomplishing anything other than serving as hot air in a rapidly inflating bubble? Jaluria said heâs watching for faster developments of models, advancements in performance, and overall AI adoption. âIf this leads to a step function change in the way enterprise is adopting and utilizing AI, that creates a benefit,â he said. Whether that is happening currently or not is kind of in the eye of the beholder. OpenAI has certainly shown advancements in its technology. The release of its Sora 2 video generation model has unleashed a fresh hell upon the world, used to generate significant amounts of copyright violations and misinformation. But the latest version of the companyâs flagship model, GPT-5, underwhelmed and failed to live up to expectations when it was released in August.Â Adoption rates of the technology are also a bit of a Rorschach test. The company boasts that 10% of the world is using ChatGPT, and nearly 80% of the business world says that itâs looking into how to utilize the technology. But the early adopters arenât finding much utility. According to a survey from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 95% of companies that have tried to integrate generative AI tools into their operations have produced zero return on investment. Where these investments are generating a return is in the stock market. Which, frankly, does not quell concerns about these firms simply boosting one anotherâs bottom line. Take Oracle, for example. Last month, the cloud provider had aÂ rough quarter by all traditional indicators. It missed on both its revenue and earnings projections, and its net income was flat year-over-year. And yet, the stock price soared. The reason: the company’s plump list of remaining performance obligationsâfinancial agreements that will provide revenue that have not yet been fulfilled. There, the company showed a massive amount of growth, a 359% increase from the year prior, with a projected $455 billion coming in.Â That money is not real yet. Nor is the growth the company has promised, claiming that its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue would grow from under $20 billion to nearly $150 billion before the start of the 2030s. But all of it was sufficient for investors to drive up Oracle’s share price enough to slingshot CEO Larry Ellison into the top spot on the world’s richest person list, briefly leapfrogging Elon Musk.Â Most of this promised revenue will come from OpenAI, which made a commitment to purchase $300 billion worth of computing power from the company over five years. The clock on that contract doesn’t start until 2027, but assuming it actually happens, it would be one of the largest cloud computing deals in history. It’s also one of the most unlikely, just based on where the companies involved currently stand. In order to provide the compute that it has promised to OpenAI, Oracle will reportedly need to generate 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, more than two Hoover Dams’ worth of power. On the other side of the deal, OpenAI will have to pay about $60 billion per year to fit the bill for the agreement. It currently generates about $10 billion in revenue, which, statistically speaking, is less than $60 billion. You can see a similar circular shape to OpenAIâs recent deal with Nvidia rival AMD, too. The exact details of the agreement werenât reported, but chipmaker AMD expects to generate tens of billions of dollars over the next half-decade as it sells its AI chips to OpenAI. As part of the agreement, OpenAI gets a swath of shares in AMD, with options to buy up to 10% of the company. Lucky for OpenAI, thereâs really no better time to get your hands on some AMD shares than right before it announces a big AI-related deal. The companyâs stock price surged by about 35% following the announcement.Â With those two most recent deals on the books, OpenAI has agreed to more than $1 trillion worth of computing deals so far this year. Thatâs a lot for any company to spend, but itâs especially a lot for a still-private company that reports just $10 billion in projected revenue through 2025. Even by its most recent funding rounds, the company as a whole is currently valued at about $500 billion. Most of those deals have contingencies attached. For instance, Nvidiaâs investment in OpenAI isnât actually $100 billion, but an initial $10 billion for one gigawatt of data center capacity with the potential for $100 billion if 10 gigawatts are ultimately achieved. But the stock prices and valuations certainly seem to treat these deals as if they are set in stone. And OpenAI seems to be operating that way, too. The company claims that itâll more than 10x its revenue in the next few years, and projects itâll hit $129 billion annually by 2029. That type of potentially inflated revenue figure is the kind of thing that makes some people think of the Dot Com bubble of the early 2000s, where we saw companies like Commerce One receive a $21 billion valuation despite barely having any revenue. But Peter Atwater, Adjunct Professor of Economics at William and Mary and President of consulting firm Financial Insyghts, sees a different reflection in the AI bubble: the housing market collapse.Â âWhat we saw at the top of the mortgage market was all of these conveyor belts of capital, money flowing from one party to another party to another party. And what you started to see was that there were multiple points of relationship so that any participant in the system was then dependent on every other conveyor belt in the system working simultaneously to keep the system going,â he told Gizmodo. âIn many ways, we’re seeing the same developing web of capital flows across the AI space.â This creates some obvious problems. The circular deals that, in theory, are wheels moving the whole thing forward all have to keep turning. If any of them stop, the whole thing stops, because they are all so interconnected that no failure is truly isolated.Â Atwater said that the types of major, metric-contingent deals that have been dominating headlines in the AI space arenât all that different from some of what was happening in the mortgage industry back in 2007, where some of the financial commitments required mortgages to meet certain conditions. âIn the frenzy of a bubble, everyone overcommits. The purpose of overcommitting is to stake a claim in what you believe will be an intensely scarce commodity in the future. So you have buyers overcommit and you have sellers agreeing to overprovide as a result,â he explained. âWhat we find over and over is that commitments are among the first obligations to be cut off once conditions change, once confidence begins to fall.â Right now, thereâs a stomach for those commitments. That isnât guaranteed to be there in the future if all of these promised returns on investment donât materialize. Atwater said that the market requires credit markets being willing to continue to extend massive sums of money to cover the agreements made, equity markets that value these transactions at âan extraordinary multiple,â and suppliers capable of delivering the promised products. Thereâs no guarantee that all of those factors will hold.Â The math is already pretty tricky. As tech commentator Ed Zitron has pointed out, major firms like Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years. Theyâve brought in a combined $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAIâs commitments are even bigger, with returns that are arguably even smaller.Â The companyâs development and expansion of its services will rely in no small part on massive data center projects, which will require the same amount of energy to operate as New York City and San Diego combinedâenergy that currently isnât even available. And, once again, there is no guarantee that the end product, once all of that energy is spent and data centers are built, will actually generate revenue. âUltimately, if you do not have a consumer for the product, there will be no AI space because these companies can’t continue to do this for nothing. Listening to a lot of the calls in the last couple of weeks, there’s a clear open question as to how these companies are going to make money at this,â Atwater said. For the moment, everyone is seeing green, and hope springs eternal. As long as that is the case, no one will ask where the revenue is coming from. âRight now, the AI sector is operating in a forever mindset. They are acting as if they have a very long period of time under which they can figure this out and make money,â Atwater said. âAs long as confidence is high, this entire ecosystem can offer fantasy. When confidence falls, they’re going to be expected to deliver real-term performance in a very short time frame.â Unfortunately, should that happen, it wonât just be these companies that bear the brunt of the failure. âYou have to look at this as a larger ecosystem. To talk about AI today, it means we have to talk about the credit market, we have to talk about the credit market. Wall Street and AI are a single beast,â Atwater said, warning that a very small number of firms currently have a major grasp on the whole of the American economy.Â Lots of investors are piling into the AI space, fearful of missing out on a market that seems like it can only go up. But few of them are looking at why those valuations and stock prices keep climbing, showing little curiosity as to what might happen if all of this money is just getting shifted around, artificially inflating the actual value of the companies they are betting on.Â ââWhy?â,â Atwater said, “is the last question asked in a bull market.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Crypto mining stocks tied to the red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) data center trade were the fastest horses on Monday to recover from Friday's market rout. Bitfarms (BITF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) surged 26% and 20% respectively on Monday, while Bitdeer (BTDR), IREN (IREN) and MARA Holdings (MARA) advanced around 10%. The rally reflects optimism that booming AI compute demand will help miners. Perhaps boosting sentiment was ChatGPT creator OpenAI striking a deal with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) to build up custom chips for AI and machine learning. Also on Monday, Bloom Energy (BE) announced a $5 billion deal with Brookfield Asset Management to deploy fuel cells in data centers to satisfy AI's voracious energy demand. The gains occurred after Friday's steep downturn as trade tensions between the U.S. and China ratcheted up, with Trump imposing a 100% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods to retaliate against tightening rare earth metals export controls. Investor concerns eased somewhat over the weekend, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes were up 2.1% and 1.4% on Monday. Other crypto related names enjoyed modest gains. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest bitcoin treasury firm, climbed 2.8%, while crypto exchange Coinbase was roughly flat. Digital brokerage Robinhood, which earns a large portion of its revenue from crypto trading, was up 1%. Ethereum ETH$3,821.57 treasury firm BitMine (BMNR), meanwhile, bounced almost 7% as the firm said to capitalize on the crypto plunge of the past few days, purchasing over 200,000 tokens worth over $840 million at current prices.

Title: The A.I. Boom and the Spectre of 1929
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-ai-boom-and-the-spectre-of-1929

As stocks plummeted on the morning of October 24th, 1929, a large crowd gathered on Wall Street outside of the New York Stock Exchange. Pat Bologna, a local shoeshiner whose life savings were invested in the market, dodged into a packed brokerage nearby. “Everybody is shouting,” he later recalled. “They’re all trying to reach the glass booth where the clerks are. Everybody wants to sell out. The boy at the quotation board is running scared. He can’t keep up with the speed of the way stocks are dropping. The board’s painted green. The guy who runs it is Irish. He’s standing at the back of the booth, on the telephone. I can’t hear what he’s saying. But a guy near me shouts, ‘the sonofabitch has sold me out!’ ” The stock-market crash of 1929 occupies a dark but indelible place in the national imagination, and for good reason. In the age of online trading and algorithmic traders, the next stock crash, whenever it comes, will be a largely digital phenomenon. But its consequences will certainly play out in the analog world: wealth destruction, human anguish, fallout in the rest of the economy. On Wall Street, as the speculative A.I. boom continues to grow, even some financial titans are acknowledging that it might not end well. “There will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown,” David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at a recent conference. Last week, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, told the BBC that he was “far more worried” than others about the possibility of a big fall in the market. A few days later, when Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on China, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dived nine hundred points, only to rebound on Monday after Trump softened his rhetoric. Perhaps the most alarming feature of the 1929 crash was that it wasn’t a one-off. After peaking in September, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average entered a downward trend that lasted nearly three years; by July of 1932, it had sunk by about ninety per cent. The crash’s giddy prequel, dramatic unfolding, and shattering aftermath—the Great Depression—has long provided compelling material for writers. In 1931, Frederick Lewis Allen, of Harper’s Magazine, described in his book “Only Yesterday” the speculative frenzy that preceded the crash: “Stories of fortunes made overnight were on everybody’s lips. . . . Wives were asking their husbands why they were so slow, why they weren’t getting in on all this, only to hear that their husbands had bought a hundred shares of American Linseed that very morning.” Almost a quarter century later, John Kenneth Galbraith brought an economist’s eye and a dry wit to the subject with “The Great Crash 1929.” The book detailed how, in the summer of that year, when stock prices were already sky-high, the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation, in partnership with the utility baron Harrison Williams, launched two huge investment trusts, the Shenandoah Corporation and the Blue Ridge Corporation, which employed leverage—that is, borrowed money—and a pyramid structure to magnify investors’ gains (or, as it turned out, their losses). “If there must be madness something may be said for having it on a heroic scale,” Galbraith wrote. In 1979, the fiftieth anniversary of the crash, the co-authors Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts published “The Day the Bubble Burst,” which included the anecdote about the shoeshiner. Now, four years before the hundredth anniversary, comes “1929,” a new book by Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for the Times and a co-anchor on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” As in Sorkin’s previous book, “Too Big to Fail,” a best-selling account of the financial crisis of 2008, he focusses mainly on the financiers and policymakers at the center of the crisis, drawing on private letters, transcripts, oral histories, architectural plans, memoirs, newspaper accounts, corporate filings, and prior histories. His narrative extends from February of 1929 to well beyond the crash, to the failed efforts of Herbert Hoover to revive a stricken economy; the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt; the U.S. Senate’s famous Pecora Commission, which exposed a great deal of Wall Street self-dealing; and the passage of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which curbed some of the Street’s excesses by separating commercial banking (making loans and taking deposits) from investment banking (selling and dealing in securities). Other reforms introduced under Roosevelt included the founding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets, and the federal insurance of bank deposits, which ended a calamitous wave of bank runs. In historical terms, the 1929 crash and the election of F.D.R. marked the dividing line between the untrammelled financial capitalism that had emerged during the Gilded Age in the late nineteenth century, and the managed capitalism of the mid-twentieth century. For several decades, this system delivered strong economic growth and a more equal income distribution, until inflation upended it and ushered in the neoliberal era of financial deregulation. (In 1999, Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed key parts of Glass-Steagall.) During the nineteen-twenties, Sorkin writes, “Wall Street became like a giant balloon floating above the common people, its self-mythologizing leaders enjoying the comforts of what felt like a privileged realm.” His leading characters include Charles Mitchell, the chairman of National City Bank, a predecessor of Citibank, who, in March of 1929, resisted efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrict bank lending to speculators in the market; Thomas Lamont, a senior partner at J. P. Morgan & Co., who, during the panic selling on October 24th, organized a futile effort to stabilize the market; and Jesse Livermore, a storied speculator who made and lost several fortunes before eventually shooting himself in the cloakroom of the Sherry-Netherland hotel. There are cameos by everyone from Al Smith and William Randolph Hearst to Winston Churchill and Groucho Marx, both of whom speculated heavily in the market and paid the price. No two speculative booms are exactly alike, of course, but they share some common elements. Typically, there is great excitement among investors about new technology—in today’s case, A.I.—and its potential to boost profits for companies positioned to take advantage of it. In the twenties, commercial radio was a novel and revolutionary medium: tens of millions of Americans tuned in. Sorkin points out that, between 1921 and 1928, stock in Radio Corporation of America, the Nvidia of its day, went from $1 ½ to $85 ½. Another hallmark of a stock bubble is that, at some point, its participants largely give up on conventional valuation measures and buy in simply because prices are rising and everybody else is doing it: FOMO rules the day. By some metrics, valuations were even higher during the late-nineteen-nineties internet stock bubble than they were in the late twenties. And according to the latest report from the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, which was released last week, valuations in the U.S. market are, by one measure, “comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble.” That’s true according to the cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which tracks stock prices relative to corporate earnings averaged over the previous ten years. If, instead of looking back, you focus on predictions of future earnings, valuations are less stretched: the Bank of England report noted that they remain “below the levels reached during the dot-com bubble.” But that’s just another way of saying that investors are betting on earnings growing rapidly in the coming years. And this is a moment when many companies have so far seen precious little return for their A.I. investments. To be sure, not everyone agrees that stock prices have departed from reality. In a note to clients last week, analysts at Goldman Sachs said the market’s rise, which is heavily concentrated in Big Tech stocks, “has, so far, been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation.” Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, whose chips power A.I. systems at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, said that he believed the world was at “the beginning of a new industrial revolution.” However, even the authors of the Goldman report acknowledged that there are elements of the current situation “that rhyme with previous bubbles,” including the big gains in stock prices and the emergence of questionable financing schemes. Last month, Nvidia announced it would invest up to one hundred billion dollars over the next decade in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, which is already a big purchaser of Nvidia’s chips and will likely need more to power its expansion. Nvidia has said OpenAI isn’t obligated to spend the money it invests on Nvidia chips, but the deal, and others like it, have sparked comparisons to the dot-com bubble, when some big tech companies engaged in so-called “circular” transactions that ultimately didn’t work out. Another recurring feature of the biggest asset booms is outright chicanery, such as fraudulent accounting, the marketing of worthless securities, and plain old stealing. Galbraith referred to this phenomenon as “the bezzle.” In hard times, he noted, creditors are tight-fisted and audits are scrupulous: as a result, “commercial morality is enormously improved.” In boom times, creditors are more trusting, lending standards get debased, and borrowed money is plentiful. But there “are always many people who need more,” Galbraith explained, and “the bezzle increases rapidly,” as it did in the late twenties. “Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth,” he went on, “so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery.” Sorkin traces the fates of Albert Wiggin and Richard Whitney, who, at the time of the crash were, respectively, the C.E.O. of Chase National Bank and the vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange. Both men were involved in the failed effort, orchestrated by Lamont, to stabilize the market. In 1932, Wiggin went on to become a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But, during the Pecora investigation, which began that same year, it emerged that, beginning in September of 1929, Wiggin had secretly shorted the stock of his own bank, using a pair of companies he owned to make the trades. He was forced to resign from the Fed. In 1930, Whitney, the scion of a prominent New England family, became the president of the stock exchange, but he was ultimately exposed as an embezzler and served more than three years in Sing Sing. On being reminded of stories like these, it’s tempting to cast the leaders of nineteen-twenties Wall Street as a bunch of crooks. Sorkin resists the impulse. In an afterword, he writes, “The difficulty is that, other than the disgraced Richard Whitney and Albert Wiggin, it is hard to make the case that any of the era’s other major financial figures did anything appreciably worse than most individuals would have done in their positions and circumstances.” Given the role that Wall Street’s élite played in inflating and promoting the bubble, this is either a generous view or a jaded commentary on the fallen nature of mankind. In any case, though, it’s true that speculative booms tend to take on a life of their own, creating incentives and opportunities that warp people’s judgment at all levels of the economy, from small investors and professional intermediaries to major corporate and financial institutions. One aspect of the current boom that hasn’t received sufficient attention is how it has extended from the stock market to the credit markets, where there has been enormous growth in so-called “private lending” by non-bank institutions, including private-equity companies, hedge funds, and specialized credit firms. Last week, news organizations reported that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into the collapse of First Brands, an acquisitive Cleveland-based auto-parts firm that, with Wall Street’s help, had apparently raised billions of dollars in opaque transactions. One creditor told a bankruptcy court that up to $2.3 billion in collateral had “simply vanished,” and called for the appointment of an independent examiner. A lawyer for First Brands said the company denied any wrongdoing and attributed the collapse to “macroeconomic factors” beyond its control. The sudden demise of a single highly leveraged company that operated in a sector far from the A.I. frontier may be a one-off event, with no broader implications. Or it could conceivably be a harbinger of what lies ahead. We won’t know for a while—perhaps a good while. But in the words of the nineteenth-century English journalist Walter Bagehot, whom Galbraith quoted, “every great crisis reveals the excessive speculations of many houses which no one before suspected.” This time is unlikely to be different. ♦

Title: OpenAI-Broadcom agreement sends shares of chipmaker soaring

Time Published: 2025-10-13T16:08:52Z

Broadcom Inc. shares jumped after OpenAI agreed to buy the company’s custom chips and networking equipment in a multiyear deal, part of an ambitious plan by the startup to add artificial intelligence infrastructure. In a pact announced Monday, OpenAI agreed to buy custom chips and networking components from Broadcom to help power its artificial intelligence services. OpenAI had already struck deals for data centers and chips that easily top $1 trillion, and the company plans to spend tens of billions of dollars more on Broadcom chips, according to people familiar with the matter. By customizing the processors, OpenAI said it will be able to embed what it has learned from developing AI models and services “directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence.” The hardware rollout should be completed by the end of 2029, according to the companies. For Broadcom, the move provides deeper access to the booming AI market. Monday’s agreement confirms an arrangement that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan had hinted at during an earnings conference call last month. Investors sent Broadcom shares up as as much as 11% on Monday, betting that the OpenAI alliance will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chipmaker. But the details of how OpenAI will pay for the equipment aren’t spelled out. While the AI startup has shown it can easily raise funding from investors, it’s burning through wads of cash and doesn’t expect to be cash-flow positive until around the end of this decade. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has inked a number of blockbuster deals this year, aiming to ease constraints on computing power. Nvidia Corp., whose chips handle the majority of AI work, said last month that it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to support new infrastructure — with a goal of at least 10 GW of capacity. And just last week, OpenAI announced a pact to deploy 6 GW of Advanced Micro Device Inc. processors over multiple years. As AI and cloud companies announce large projects every few days, it’s often not clear how the efforts are being financed. The interlocking deals also have boosted fears of a bubble in AI spending, particularly as many of these partnerships involve OpenAI, a fast-growing but unprofitable business. While purchasing chips from others, OpenAI has also been working on designing its own semiconductors. They’re mainly intended to handle the inference stage of running AI models — the phase after the technology is trained. There’s no investment or stock component to the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said, making it different than the agreements with Nvidia and AMD. An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment on how the company will finance the chips, but the underlying idea is that more computing power will let the company sell more services. A single gigawatt of AI computing capacity today costs roughly $35 billion for the chips alone, with 10 GW totaling upwards of $350 billion. But a chief reason OpenAI is working to develop its own chip is to bring down its costs, and it’s unclear what price Broadcom’s chips will command under the deal. OpenAI might be trying to emulate Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which made its own chips using Broadcom’s technology and saw lower costs compared with other AI companies, such as Meta Platforms Inc., according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. Google’s success with Broadcom might have steered OpenAI to that chipmaker, rather than suppliers such as Marvell Technology Inc., Singh added. In announcing the agreement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that his company has been working with Broadcom for 18 months. The startup is rethinking technology starting with the transistors and going all the way up to what happens when someone asks ChatGPT a question, he said on a podcast released by his company. “By being able to optimize across that entire stack, we can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models.” When Tan referred to the agreement last month, he didn’t name the customer, though people familiar with the matter identified it as OpenAI. “If you do your own chips, you control your destiny,” Tan said in the podcast Monday. Broadcom has increasingly been seen as a key beneficiary of AI spending, helping propel its share price this year. The stock was up 40% so far this year through Friday’s close, outpacing a 29% gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. OpenAI, meanwhile, has garnered a $500 billion valuation, making it the world’s biggest startup by that measure. By tapping Broadcom’s networking technology, OpenAI is hedging its bets. Broadcom’s Ethernet-based options compete with Nvidia’s proprietary technology. OpenAI also will be designing its own gear as part of its work on custom hardware, the startup said. Broadcom won’t be providing the data center capacity itself. Instead, it will deploy server racks with custom hardware to facilities run by either OpenAI or its cloud-computing partners. A single gigawatt is about the capacity of a conventional nuclear power plant. Still, 10 GW of computing power alone isn’t enough to support OpenAI’s vision of achieving artificial general intelligence, said OpenAI co-founder and President Greg Brockman. “That is a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to go,” he said. Getting to the level under discussion isn’t going to happen quickly, said Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group. “Take railroads — it took about a century to roll it out as critical infrastructure. If you take the internet, it took about 30 years,” he said. “This is not going to take five years.”

Title: It's Broadcom's Turn to Get a Stock Bump From Some OpenAI News

OpenAI isn't publicly traded. But when it acts, stocks often move. On Monday, it was Broadcom's (AVGO) turn. Shares of the chipmaker were recently up nearly 10%, approaching 2025 highs, following an announcement that the ChatGPT maker would team with the chipmaker to co-develop AI systems for delivery from 2026 to 2029. Today's climb in Broadcom shares is another example of the sustained popularity of the news-driven AI trade, which continues amid concerns about whether there's a bubble in the sector. It also highlights the power of OpenAI, considered the world's most valuable startup at about half a trillion dollars. One way for a stock to get a lift these days: land a mention in a press release or news report involving OpenAI, the company known for ChatGPT. Shares of Broadcom jumped Monday on just such an announcement, the latest to involve a major tech company. The deal is "a pivotal moment in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence," Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. OpenAI chief Sam Altman called it "a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential." The Broadcom news follows a raft of other OpenAI announcements in recent weeks. News about a partnership with AMD (AMD) powered that chip maker's shares higher in early October. And Nvidia's (NVDA) stock rose last month after it announced plans to invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI. (September reports also highlighted a multiyear Oracle (ORCL)-OpenAI deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars.) And when OpenAI had a "DevDay" event earlier this month, shares of a range of companies that were mentioned—including Figma (FIG) and Expedia (EXPE)—also got lifts. As for Broadcom specifically, its shares recently changed hands at about $356, roughly 9% off the Visible Alpha mean of Wall Street analysts near $389. The stock has gained 54% since the start of 2025.

Title: Holiday hiring forecast to fall to 16-year low as tariffs force retail pullback
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/tariffs-trump-holiday-hiring-shopping-inflation-shrinks-retailers/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T15:12:46Z
Full Content:
Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago. Among the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. “We are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they’re making to their workforce.” In addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy’s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started. The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. “Radial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.” So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target said it’s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool. Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: JD Vance On Three Sunday Shows Is Three Times As Charming!

Time Published: 2025-10-13T14:31:26Z
Full Content:
JD Vance appeared on multiple Sunday shows this week. He was as charming, we mean off-putting and repellent, as ever. Let’s dive in! Beginning chronologically, Vance went on NBC to try his luck with Kristen Welker. If Vance was trying to prove he isn’t a sycophant, he failed almost immediately when he started by trying to chastise NBC News for not adequately praising King “MAGAbicho”: VANCE: But I also have to give your network a little bit of grief, Kristen, because last night I was watching NBC. They […] mentioned that during a rally last night in Israel, when Steve Witkoff, our great special envoy, mentioned Bibi Netanyahu the crowd booed. But the broadcast didn’t mention that when Steve Witkoff mentioned President Trump, the crowd actually cheered. And why is that, Kristen? Yes, and why didn’t the Nobel Committee make a one-time exception and give two Peace Prizes this year so Trump could have one? Waaah! (Netanyahu nominated Trump for a consolation prize today in Israel, don’t worry.) Subscribe! Later, the topic shifted to the GOP’s government shutdown, now hitting the two-week mark. Welker played a montage of Trump saying during the Obama years that it’s the president’s job to settle a shutdown. Confronted with a conflicting truth he can’t deny, again Vance opted for accidental honesty. VANCE: Well, Kristen, the president was talking back then when Barack Obama was president about the political realities. We are focused now on the governing realities because we’re in power. In other words, it was really easy to armchair quarterback how amazing a dealmaker he would have been when Obama was president, but now he’s in charge and finding out he sucks. Got it. Now that the GOP has given up on last week’s lie about “illegals getting healthcare” as their boogeyman during this shutdown, Vance has moved on to faux empathy for the people affected by it. VANCE: Well, I just think it shows the different priorities of Democrats and Republicans in the midst of these shutdowns. You really have to ask yourself, “Who do we care more about? Federal bureaucrats in Washington DC or low-income women getting the food benefits they deserve, our troops getting the payment they need, flood insurance across the Southeast in the midst of hurricane season?” Are you fucking serious right now? The GOP has cut $267 billion in SNAP benefits, plus further cuts in the Blowjobs For Billionaires Bill. The Education Department just wiped out the special education offices.Tthe Trump administration proposed FEMA making it harder to get federal disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. Trump just gave a $20 billion bailout to Argentina’s libertarian government while they undercut American soybean farmers. And they’ve proposed stiffing furloughed federal workers on their backpay. GTFOH. Vance tried his luck with Margaret Brennan. Brennan pushed Vance on the self-inflicted chaos of the Trump Administration’s layoffs. BRENNAN: CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that’s not the case. But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC? VANCE: […] First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job […] But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. […] BRENNAN: […] But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. As we frantically search for hazmat suits on Amazon, we certainly feel confident if another pandemic happens under these chucklefucks. Brennan asked about labor union legal challenges to these layoffs, and Vance’s central processing system began to deteriorate as he spat this out. VANCE: Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases. This is gibberish. Third time’s the charm? Nah! George Stephanopoulos asked Vance about Border Czar Tom Homan being caught on tape by the FBI accepting a $50,000 bribe. Vance refused to answer the question repeatedly, so Stephanopoulos ended the interview in the only manner appropriate: STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn’t insinuate anything. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50,000, as was heard on an audio tape recorded by the FBI in September 2024. You did not answer the question. Thank you for your time. VANCE: No, George, I sai-- STEPHANOPOULOS: We’ll be right back. Stuffing these losers into metaphorical lockers is the only way to treat them. Have a week.

Title: OpenAI taps Broadcom to build its first AI processor
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1013/1538322-openai-taps-broadcom-to-build-its-first-ai-processor/

Full Content:
OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. The companies said today that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million US households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data centre systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. "Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply. The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term. The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI. Broadcom and OpenAI said today that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom's Ethernet and other networking gear, giving the company an edge over smaller rivals such as Marvell Technology and challenging Nvidia's InfiniBand networking solution. © RTÉ 2025.

October 13, 2025 09:46 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "North America Modular Construction Market Size, Share, Trends and Forecast by Division, Sector, Material, and Country, 2025-2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The North America modular construction market size was valued at USD 28.64 Billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is set to reach USD 43.67 Billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.56% from 2025-2033. The market is driven by factors such as cost efficiency, reduced construction time, and increasing demand for sustainable, energy-efficient buildings. Additionally, the need for affordable housing, advancements in construction technology, and government incentives supporting green building practices are further driving market growth, positioning modular construction as a preferred solution. With increasing emphasis on eco-friendly building practices, modular construction is gaining traction due to its ability to incorporate sustainable materials, energy-efficient designs, and lower carbon footprints in comparison to conventional construction techniques. In addition, modular construction enables concurrent off-site fabrication and on-site setup, decreasing total construction duration. This efficiency is critical in sectors like residential housing and commercial buildings where time-to-market is crucial. Besides this, modular construction helps lower labor costs and reduces material waste due to controlled factory settings. The reduction in project timelines leads to significant savings, rendering it an appealing choice for developers. Furthermore, the rising need for cost-effective housing, especially in city regions, is making modular construction a preferred solution. It offers faster, cost-effective, and customizable options that can address the housing gap without sacrificing quality.Apart from this, the integration of technologies like automation, 3D printing, and building information modeling (BIM) is revolutionizing modular construction. These innovations improve precision, design flexibility, and scalability, making modular units more competitive with traditional construction methods. Moreover, governing bodies across North America are mandating energy-efficient building standards. Modular construction offers an ideal way to meet these standards through its ability to integrate advanced insulation, renewable energy systems, and energy-efficient materials. Additionally, the shortage of skilled labor in traditional construction is driving the North America modular construction market demand. Modular construction relies more on factory-based assembly, where less specialized labor is required, addressing the labor gap and ensuring projects stay on track. Competitive Landscape:Major participants in the market are concentrating on broadening their product ranges, enhancing manufacturing effectiveness, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies like 3D printing and automation. They are emphasizing sustainability by including environment-friendly materials and energy-saving designs in their modular units. These athletes are also building strategic alliances with suppliers and contractors to improve their supply chains and lower expenses. Furthermore, numerous entities are channeling funds into research initiatives to innovate and address the increasing need for budget-friendly housing and commercial properties. To remain competitive, they are broadening their geographical presence, especially in areas with strong construction demand, while also concentrating on mergers and acquisitions (M&A).North America Modular Construction Market Trends: Growing Adoption by Major Real Estate DevelopersLarge real estate developers are adopting modular construction for their residential and commercial projects due to its effectiveness, economical advantages, and sustainability perks. By integrating modular methods, developers can greatly shorten construction timelines, optimize budget management, and minimize waste. Additionally, this approach is highly customizable, allowing developers to meet specific design needs while maintaining cost control. As sustainability becomes a priority, modular buildings offer reduced environmental impact, with fewer materials wasted and a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional construction. This growing trend among prominent developers signals a shift towards scalable and innovative building solutions. As major players in the real estate market recognize the long-term financial and ecological advantages, the adoption of modular construction is expected to increase, encouraging further investment and expanding its role in the sector. In 2024, Greystar Real Estate Partners initiated its inaugural modular housing project in the US, Ltd. Findlay, located in Coraopolis, PA. The development included 312 apartments and highlights quicker building, savings on costs, and minimized waste. Greystar intends to grow its modular portfolio by adding additional projects in the US.Labor Shortages in the Construction IndustryLabor shortages are becoming a significant challenge in the traditional construction industry, contributing to delays and increased costs. Modular construction, however, helps mitigate this issue by reducing the dependency concerning skilled workers during the on-site assembly stage. A large part of the modular construction process takes place in regulated factory settings, where automated systems, machinery, and trained workers contribute to efficient production. This method helps bypass labor shortages while still delivering high-quality, durable structures. Additionally, modular construction reduces on-site work, allowing projects to proceed more quickly and without being hindered by fluctuations in available skilled labor. As labor shortages persist, modular construction's ability to streamline operations is making it an attractive alternative to conventional construction techniques. In 2024, Webcor, a commercial construction company based in California, declared the establishment of Webcor Ventures, LLC, and made its first investment in R2 Building, a company specializing in modular construction. The collaboration sought to tackle industry issues such as cost, efficiency, and workforce shortages by utilizing off-site manufacturing to create scalable, high-quality housing options.Government-Funded InitiativesGovernment funding initiatives are essential for fostering the development of modular construction in North America. These efforts offer financial assistance for creating innovative construction solutions, such as modular homes. Through the provision of grants, loans, and incentives, governing bodies in the region are enhancing the accessibility and appeal of modular construction for developers. Specifically, funding frequently targets tackling housing deficits and aiding infrastructure initiatives, enabling faster and more cost-effective building. Changes in regulations and affordable financing promote the use of modular construction, enabling developers to lower initial expenses and adhere to strict construction schedules. These government-supported initiatives are hastening the uptake of modular solutions, establishing them as a crucial approach to address urban housing needs while promoting efficiency and reducing costs. For example, in 2024, the Government of Canada launched two initiatives to speed up housing development. The Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund (CHIF) allocated $1 billion for necessary infrastructure, while the Regional Homebuilding Innovation Initiative (RHII) designated $50 million to encourage innovative home construction methods, including modular housing.

Title: Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs forces many retailers to be cautious on holiday hiring
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/13/holiday-hiring-economy-tariffs-impact/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T13:39:20Z

By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, it took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. But job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts overall holiday hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for roughly 120 companies like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, below the 32,700 a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Challenger also noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from years past. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday mass firings of federal workers have started. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are selective. Analysts will also be watching how shoppers will react to price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compares with 4.2% last year. And Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Companies are increasingly wanting to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff. Radial is also training holiday hires faster with new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target will offer current workers additional hours and then will tap into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the largest private employer, has been offering its workers extra hours available during the holidays, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but most locations will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that with the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time. Meanwhile, the temporary halt of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about sales forecasts and the workers they may need. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.”

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (AVGO) stock is down 9.6% in 21 trading days. Already own the stock? You might want to consider continuing holding it. Planning to buy? This might be your opportunity. Consider the following data: While we like to buy dips if the fundamentals check out - for AVGO, see Buy or Sell AVGO Stock - we are wary of falling knives. Specifically, it is worth trying to answer if things get really bad, and AVGO drops another 20-30% to $227 levels, will we be able to hold on to the stock? What is the worst case scenario? We call it downturn resilience. Turns out, the stock saw an impact slightly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. AVGO stock has fallen meaningfully recently and we currently find it attractive but volatile. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) - HQ has outperformed its benchmark - a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, and achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Risk management is key - consider, what could long-term portfolio performance be if you blended 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Below are the details, but before that, as a quick background: AVGO provides semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, including set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction Worried that AVGO could fall much more? You could take a look at the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy's last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers. Retailers' hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that's paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started. The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown's impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That's compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year's 8.7% growth. Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today's environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial's Wnorowski said. “Radial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.” So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that's simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target said it's again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the nation's largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it's worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don't anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool. Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

(AP Photo/Anne D’Innocenzio, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, it took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. But job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts overall holiday hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for roughly 120 companies like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, below the 32,700 a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Challenger also noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing.

Title: Inside Blur, the Indie VFX Animation Studio ‘By Artists, for Artists’ That’s Defying the Odds
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/blur-studio-profile-tim-miller-nan-morales-sonic-love-death-robots/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T13:15:00Z
Full Content:
Pro Available to WrapPRO members Co-founder and owner Tim Miller and president Nan Morales talk about why they prefer to stay small and the studio’s next phase Even if you have never heard of Blur Studio, you’ve definitely seen its work. The Culver City, Calif.-based animation and visual effects studio does it all — the production of the wildly successful “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies and the Emmy-nominated animated anthology series “Love, Death & Robots” (on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (on Prime Video); video game cut scenes for AAA titles like “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare;” the jaw-dropping opening credits for David Fincher’s “Girl With the Dragon Tattoo:” and even the animation for Universal Studios’ The Simpsons Ride. Its 2004 animated short film “Gopher Broke,” directed by Jeff Fowler (who would go on to direct the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies), was nominated for an Oscar. Tim Miller, the company’s co-founder and owner, directed the first “Deadpool” movie and 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate.” But perhaps more impressive than the output is its financial performance. Blur Studio is profitable and has never been in debt or had outside financing or loans against the company. It was founded in 1995 and has roughly 100 employees. In an interview with TheWrap, Miller described Blur as “a company built by artists, for artists, to create content that I feel like otherwise wouldn’t make it to screens, big and small.” Nan Morales, Blur’s president, added, “I also think we spent the last few years recruiting the best teams globally and we’re building the community for the visual work and storytelling.” Its success stands in stark contrast with most visual effects houses that have trouble remaining afloat. The challenges emerge from productions awarding jobs to the lowest-bidder, creating an untenable situation when projects stretch over months and filmmakers demand countless VFX iterations — the impact being massive blockbusters with poor CGI scenes and a rising number of visual effects houses closing. So how did Blur avoid this fate? “I would love to say that it’s all due to precise planning and pinpoint accuracy and focus. But a lot of it is luck,” Miller said. “We got into the games industry, which to some degree has been protected by tax incentives, and it’s an industry that we love, which is the luckiest thing. We get to work with these great partners on this cutting edge technology, on the kind of subject matter that, honestly, I always wanted to work on.” The tax incentives that protected video game production allowed Blur to stay in Los Angeles at a time when studios were fleeing to Vancouver or London. Although the video game industry isn’t immune to periods of decline, as sweeping layoffs have hit major game companies over the last few years. Which makes Blur’s diversification all the more important. Miller said that most of Blur’s output is “work for hire.” There are plenty of projects that Blur is developing in-house but they function primarily as a studio who is hired by outside companies – video game publishers and streaming studios – to create content for them. Blur then partners with other studios to make sure that all the work gets done. This approach also adds visual variety to projects, like the different art styles and aesthetics that populate both “Love, Death & Robots” (developed in-house by Blur and streaming on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (a project that originated with Sony’s video game division and streams on Prime Video). “When I started the studio, it was because I thought nobody would let me direct an animated film unless I actually owned a studio that could do it, which was my reason for building it,” Miller said. But he’s also thankful he has “Love, Death & Robots,” an R-rated animated anthology series full of sex and violence that Blur produces and which allows him to “hire our competitors in the game cinematic space.” “They’re all people that normally are competing for jobs against us, which is great because it’s this really tight community of really driven boutique studios where I think the best artists are. On ‘Love, Death & Robots,’ we’ll do two or three episodes every season. And for now, for ‘Secret Level,’ we’ll do two or three episodes ourselves, and then we spread the love around.” When Miller started Blur in the 1995, the same year that Pixar released the first feature-length computer animated film “Toy Story,” he wanted to be “the dark Pixar and build this big company.” Los Angeles was the epicenter for the emerging computer animation movement. Now? “That’s not so much my goal,” Miller said. “It’s not sustainable,” Morales said of making that dream a reality. “We’re not seeing a business practice that that’s a sustainable market. We’re a small, boutique shop. We’re like 100 employees. People think we’re huge. We’re not. That’s why we have to have our vendor partners and seek out the best people that are out there.” Blur is an animation studio that develops projects and animates parts of those projects but also partners with other studios to complete the work. Blur might animate an entire opening title sequence or video game cinematic, but on larger, more complex projects like “Love, Death & Robots,” they’ll work with other studios to bring most of the segments to life. And on even the biggest projects, like the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies (and the Paramount+ spinoff series “Knuckles”), studios like MPC and Industrial Light & Magic also worked on the effects and animation. It used to be that animation studios would do all the work for a single project, but it’s becoming more commonplace for a studio to work on most of the animation while also farming out different sections. DreamWorks Animation’s recent “The Bad Guys 2,” for example, had some key sequences handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Blur was quietly ahead of the curve. The work is having an impact on the industry. Morales talked about a small studio Blur worked with that was flying under the radar but was able to hire 150 people for a big job because of its work on “Secret Level.” “These boutique shops are doing quite well from ‘Secret Level’ and ‘Love Death & Robots,’ in the sense that their work is being shown globally,” Morales said. She added that this work keeps other studios from faltering. “2024 was awful,” Morales said. “I came into a huge dip in the economy for trailers and cinematics and even content. It just died out. In 2025, we did okay, and hopefully we keep going forward, it’s a struggle for everyone out there. And I’m really happy the way we have built a community of sharing, trying to help everyone stay afloat. It’s not the big companies, it’s the small companies that have to stand around, to make it competitive out there.” But while keeping Blur small makes the economics of the company work in its favor, Miller also has a creative reason for doing so. “My reason for the size of the company, is I realized I’m selfish, and running a big company doesn’t excite me as much as doing the work,” Miller said. “The only reason to be that big would be to get rich. And that doesn’t interest me nearly as much as making stuff.” Miller said that the model that they’ve worked out, where they collaborate with their partners and friends, is ideal. That way, when they come off of a show, they aren’t forced with cutting payroll or hours or employees just to stay afloat. “I’m working on a new idea to split the difference between a loose alliance of sorts that might help all the problems that these smaller studios face,” Miller teased. “But do I think about being a big behemoth? Those days might be over.” A major disrupter is entering the industry in the form of AI, with its magical promises of being able to produce entire animated films and cut the need for human creatives significantly (which so far, haven’t been fulfilled). But the process has an uncanny ability to mimic actual art, as was seen by the wave of Hayao Miyazaki rip-offs that flooded social media earlier this year. In June, Miller was on a panel at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival where other speakers were “dancing around the issue.” He dove right in. “I was like, ‘Why are you guys talking like this thing may go away or it may not be a factor or if we close our eyes, it might not exist? It’s not going to happen.’” In the past, any new technology or tool that would come along, Miller and other creatives in the field would jump on it, “because it would increase my creative abilities.” Not when it comes to AI. “I’ve seen a real resistance to the AI tools, and I get it, it feels like an existential threat to their jobs, and by extension, their families and their lives. I think that’s a very justified and real concern for the industry. I understand the terror, but it means that people stay away from it, and they cover their eyes and pretend it doesn’t happen,” Miller said, noting he would rather be in control of the technology than leave it to a large corporation. Miller and Blur had developed an adaptation of English author China Miéville’s 2000 novel “Perdido Street Station” at Amazon, which is no longer moving forward. The project was, in Miller’s estimation “incredibly complicated – lots of characters and creatures and everything.” The property was decidedly “not for kids” and would have been “prohibitively expensive to make with the traditional tools.” “But AI gives us a chance at using the efficiencies that it could bring to all parts of the pipeline to tell a story at a cost that it can afford to not be for 11-year-olds,” Miller said. “That kind of s–t gives me hope. It shouldn’t cost $200 million to make a movie.” “It’s innovation of tools,” Morales said of AI. “It’s not replacing the artist … As a tool base to allow us some more latitude and be able to create environments that aren’t key elements to a storytelling, I think people will accept that, and it will help us bring more stories to the public.” Not that she’s totally sold. She recently saw some AI-generated “content” (her word) and she found it wanting. “It’s not very visually pleasing,” Morales said. Miller was reluctant to get in a debate about what AI can or can’t do, because it might be able to do something that we don’t even know about yet. Still, it’s enough for Miller to quote Arthur C. Clarke – “the future is not only stranger than you imagine, it’s stranger than you can imagine.” “I feel a bit of that right now,” Miller admitted. “I personally believe that for the next 12 months, our plan is to not replace our pipeline. It’s about what parts of the process can we make better and more efficient. On the production side, being able to look at the data of how we do things and how long it takes and where we put our focus is as important as the actual pixel manipulation.” One thing that has remained slightly out of reach for Miller and the team at Blur has been the production of an animated feature. Morales said that the company can “definitely do” an animated feature and Miller said, “We have to work with our partners.” He said that “The Goon” — a graphic novel adaptation that Blur Studio and David Fincher have been trying to get off the ground since 2008 — had recently been set up at Netflix. It took a year to put the deal together. And a month after they signed the agreement, Netflix told them, “We’re not going to do adult animated features anymore.” “I’m like, Oh my God, f–king kill me,” Miller said. It just made him more determined to make it himself. Miller said that he’s sympathetic to what happens to these movies at studios, but Blur is always seemingly caught in those corporate crosshairs. “We’ve got so much cool stuff developed and then somebody leaves and the new person doesn’t like it or somebody doesn’t have the power to push it through,” he said. “Love, Death & Robots,” for instance, initially started life as a reboot of the animated anthology film “Heavy Metal,” based on the American comic book magazine known for its bleak, but visually lush, sci-fi, fantasy and horror elements. Miller had some amazing directors lined up to direct individual segments, including Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Zack Snyder, Guillermo del Toro and James Cameron. But after more than a decade, he pivoted and turned it into a television series, which has now had 45 episodes and received multiple Emmy wins, and remains one of the most exciting animated series currently streaming. Morales said that when she came to Blur, “I could see the future and the animation space filling in the live-action, tentpole movie space, when studios are looking at $200 million+ and I know in animation we could do that for a lot less and give them the same quality.” She points to the “Warhammer” episode of “Secret Level,” which is just as tense and thrilling as any live-action feature, rendered gorgeously (and in a video game engine, no less) for a fraction of the cost of, say, the latest Marvel Studios movie. “When I walked in the first day and talked to Tim and saw ‘Warhammer,’ I said, ‘That’s the future. That’s the future of big movies,” Morales said. “We have to embrace that and show that skill.’ And I think Blur can lead that charge for a lot of people. We’re seeing the ability to do it right now. It’s just actually putting it out there.” Using a video game engine to make an entire animated feature, or even part of an animated feature, would be a breakthrough, but the world of visual effects has been embracing the technology over the past few years. The most notable example of this is The Volume, the virtual stage system that Industrial Light & Magic developed and first employed on Lucasfilm’s Disney+ streaming series “The Mandalorian.” The technology, dubbed StageCraft, utilizes real-time computing and video game engines to create animated backdrops and star-fields live on set, instead of using a blue or green screen and filling it in later. And it’s being employed on movies that don’t take place in a galaxy far, far away, most recently on the Colin Farrell/Margot Robbie romantic fantasy “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” which debuted last month. Maybe the biggest challenge Miller faces, he said, is the “big group of people who just don’t like animation.” “They’re not going to come inside the tent. But if we can get across the uncanny valley, and I do think we’re almost there, then that opens up a whole different world of stories for animation,” Miller said. “It opens up a whole different demo of people who will watch the content because it looks like live action, or close enough to live action that it’ll get us across. I mean, video games did a lot to bring people into the adult animation tent.” About 15 years ago, a trailer surfaced for an adaptation of Eric Powell’s beloved comic book series “The Goon.” The brief clip, directed by Miller, was visually inventive and a loving reinvention of the source material. An eventual movie, produced by Fincher, was proposed, with a Kickstarter campaign launched to cover necessary pre-production costs. But the latest setback at Netflix hasn’t deterred Miller. Maybe, with the right tools, he says, it can finally see the light of day instead of remaining on Blur’s perpetual to-do list. “I don’t give up,” Miller said. “I never give up.” And you tend to believe him.

Title: Step Into The Shadows And Take A Peek At My Purloined Portfolio

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Do you keep an eye on your competition? Of course you do. Competition research is common sense. When you think a competitor has a great idea, adopt it or adapt it. In that spirit, once a year I compile a Purloined Portfolio, consisting of one stock from each of five rival investment managers I respect. Here goes. I’ve always been a fan of Scott Black, who heads Delphi Management in Boston. Black is a major art collector and Democratic Party donor. He is featured in Barron’s magazine each year on its stock-picking panel. From his holdings, I select Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B). Berkshire has been run for six decades by investment legend Warren Buffett, who plans to relinquish the helm at the end of this year. I think he has a good team in place, led by Greg Abel, who will be the next CEO. I regard Berkshire as the country’s most successful conglomerate. I don’t advocate breaking it up, but if Abel needed or wanted to sell off some of the pieces, I think he could reap high valuations for many of them. Randall Eley runs pension-fund money and the Edgar Lomax Value Fund (LOMAX) in Alexandria, Virginia. His largest holding is CVS Health Corp. (CVS). You might be surprised by this choice, since the stock has lost 24% of its value over the past decade. I think CVS is poised for a comeback. One of its competitors, Rite Aid, has declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Its largest competitor, Walgreens, seems to me to have lost some of its mojo. CVS is considering selling or splitting off Caremark (a pharmacy benefits manager) and Aetna (a health insurer). I’m in favor of such a move. I believe that pharmacy benefits management has build-in conflicts of interest. As for health insurance, I think it’s a difficult business because of rising health-care costs. The core drugstore business is the one that most appeals to me. A veteran international stock picker, Benard (Bernie) Horn runs the Polaris Global Value Fund. From his holdings I draw Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MUFG). It’s the largest bank in Japan, and also owns approximately 23% of Morgan Stanley, a big investment bank in the U.S. In the past four quarters, Mitsubishi UFJ has seen profits climb 29%, on a 10% increase in revenue. Most analysts expect growth to slow down. Should you buy it? Analytical opinion is split, but I think the present valuation (14 times recent earnings and 1.3 times book value) leaves room for more gains. Matrix Asset Advisors in New York City manages a little over $1 billion, with David Katz as chief investment officer. One of the stocks he owns is L3 Harris Technologies Inc. (LHX), a defense contractor that specializes in military electronics. I think that ISR – intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance – is already vital to national defense, and will become even more so. That why I like L3 Harris even though it’s more expensive than I normally go for. The stock trades at 33 times recent earnings and 24 times estimated earnings. The Buffalo International Fund, run by Nicole Kornitzer, is up more than 16% this year through October 10. From Kornitzer’s holdings, I choose the same stock I did last year, Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Co. (TSM). In the past year, it’s up 47%. It might seem crazy to hope for more, but I do. Every major semiconductor company I know, except Intel Corp. (INTC), uses TSM to manufacture its chips. Thus, TSM is at the very heart of the global economy. Of course, there is geopolitical risk: An invasion of Taiwan by China is a real threat. In the past year (October 14, 2024 through October 10, 2025) my Purloined Portfolio returned 20.1%, including dividends. That handily beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index, which returned 13.3%. Leading the charge was Taiwan Semiconductor’s 47% return. Also doing well was J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), drawn from David Katz’s holdings. My worst selection was Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), which declined 27%. The long-term results are also favorable. In 21 years, my Purloined Portfolios have averaged 13.2%, while the S&P 500 has averaged 11.6%. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Of the 21 stolen-idea lists, 17 have been profitable and 11 have beaten the S&P. Disclosure: I own Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFG and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients. John Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston. His firm of clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column. He can be reached at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com.

Title: Up 4x This Year, Does AST SpaceMobile Stock's Rally Have Legs?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/13/up-4x-this-year-does-ast-spacemobile-stocks-rally-have-legs/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T11:45:57Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AST SpaceMobile stock (NASDAQ:ASTS) soared nearly 32% last week and has risen almost 4x year-to-date. The company is constructing a space-based cellular broadband network that connects directly to standard smartphones without requiring additional hardware for commercial and governmental utilization. The recent increase followed the announcement of a significant commercial partnership with Verizon to offer space-based cellular coverage throughout the continental U.S. beginning in 2026. This agreement enhances an initial strategic partnership from last year by formalizing the commercial rollout, integrating AST’s satellite network with Verizon's terrestrial infrastructure, and expanding Verizon’s 850 MHz spectrum coverage into remote regions. The agreement fortifies AST’s position against rivals such as SpaceX's Starlink and assists in strengthening its relationships with leading U.S. telecom providers. ASTS stock has experienced a substantial rise recently, yet there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, there is great value in a broader diversified strategy we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, ponder what the long-term performance of your portfolio could look like if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities. There is a continuous competition to establish broadband services via satellites, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX currently leading with over 8,000 Starlink satellites already in orbit. However, AST SpaceMobile’s approach diverges in crucial ways. While Starlink focuses on consumers directly by offering hardware and internet subscriptions, AST’s satellites are engineered to operate like space-based cell towers, integrating directly into the networks of existing mobile operators such as AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, and Verizon. This strategy allows users to access connectivity through these satellites using their regular smartphones and current SIM cards, helping to remove coverage dead zones. During its Q2 2025 earnings report, the company stated that it had verified a plan to launch 45 to 60 satellites into orbit by 2026 to energize cellular-based broadband networks. The firm aims to conduct orbital launches every one to two months on average throughout 2025 and 2026 and mentioned that the satellites are fully funded. For telecom providers, the value proposition is considerable. Collaborating with AST enables them to extend 4G and 5G coverage into deserts, oceans, mountainous regions, and other underserved locales where conventional towers are not financially viable. This allows them to offer truly nationwide or even global coverage to clients. These advantages can enhance customer satisfaction and open new revenue opportunities without telecom providers needing to incur the substantial costs associated with rural infrastructure. Instead of advertising directly to consumers, AST generates revenue by charging telecom providers for access to its satellite capacity, with pricing determined by usage or through long-term contracts. This model could afford AST a recurring, high-margin revenue stream while solidifying deep partnerships across the international telecom sector. AST has reportedly engaged with over 50 mobile network operators globally, enabling them to serve nearly 3 billion subscribers. With a market capitalization of approximately $31 billion, ASTS is trading at over 500x the consensus revenue projection for 2025 of $60 million and 120x the estimated revenue for 2026. This represents a steep valuation considering that the company is still in the nascent stages of its operations. Nonetheless, growth has been rapid, although on a small base, with revenues increasing 249% over the previous year to $4.9 million. See ASTS Revenue Comparison. Losses remain substantial, with operating losses amounting to $260 million over the last 12 months. ASTS has performed significantly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. During the 2022 inflation shock market crash, ASTS stock plummeted 68.5% from a peak of $22.50 on February 9, 2021, to $7.08 on June 1, 2021, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. Read ASTS Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Nonetheless, the company continues to possess a robust balance sheet, with $924 million in cash and cash equivalents, a debt-to-equity ratio of merely 4.3%, and cash accounting for nearly half of its total assets. This financial flexibility ought to provide AST the necessary runway to implement its satellite deployment strategy, although investors will need to exercise patience as the company transitions from technology deployment to commercial-scale revenue generation. Robust demand is one of the factors we consider in our High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Oracle Stock Rose 122% In 6 Months
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/13/why-oracle-stock-rose-122-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T11:01:45Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 122.2% change in Oracle (ORCL) stock between April 13, 2025, and October 10, 2025, was primarily driven by a 119.3% expansion in the company’s P/E multiple. There’s more to this story than numbers alone—but first, let’s break down the movement and its key contributors. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for ORCL stock. Before that, as a quick background: ORCL provides cloud software as a service, industry-specific cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services. Opinion: We currently find ORCL stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Oracle isn’t immune to big drops. It plunged nearly 77% in the Dot-Com Bubble and slid over 41% during the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock wasn’t kind either, with a 40% dip. Even the smaller events — 2018 Correction and Covid Pandemic — pushed it down around 19% and 29% respectively. Solid fundamentals matter, but when sell-offs hit, Oracle can see serious pullbacks. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Amid the uncertainty around H-1B visas, Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS) K Krithivasan has opened up about the IT giant's view on the work visa, restrictions on which, introduced by US President Donald Trump, have rocked the industry. Krithivasan's comments take on particular importance, with TCS being the second-biggest beneficiary of the H-1B programme in 2025 after Amazon, with over 5,000 H-1B visas approved in 2025 alone. In an interview with Business Standard, Krithivasan addressed not just concerns regarding the work visa, but also spoke about the company's recent move to lay off 12,000 people globally. On the back of the layoffs, US Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin had raised questions about the company hiring over 5,500 H-1B workers, which the tech CEO addressed directly in the interview. Commenting on facing questions from US Senators, Krithivasan said, "I was neither happy nor unhappy. It gave me an opportunity to articulate our positions more clearly and to address the Senators’ questions about the H-1B issue." Explaining that the "figure of 5,500" pertained to people amending or renewing their H-1B petitions, the TCS CEO said that fresh applications were much lower, "probably around 2,500". "We have 31,000 to 32,000 employees in the US, of whom only 11,000 to 12,000 are on H-1B visas, while the rest are on other types of visas. We have been progressively increasing local workforce participation, which will continue because the way of work has changed with new kinds of projects and AI coming into play, where you need to work closely with the customer and need different skill sets," Krithivasan was quoted as saying. "It is not just about engineering skills anymore; there is a growing demand for creative thinking and prompt engineering skills. In FY26, we sent just 500 people from India to the US on H-1B visas, which means we can survive without them (H-1B visas). There is no dependence on H-1B visas," the TCS CEO, most notably, said. "There was a time when this was a significant retention policy, but over the past four-five years, it has been on a declining trend. It is now far less of a retention policy than it once was, and we should not be assessing today’s scenario through yesterday’s lens," he added. When quizzed about the mass layoffs at TCS, Krithivasan explained that only two categories of employees had been affected: those on the bench for three to six months, and those who were underperforming. "I don’t believe the Tata group, while humane, would have retained employees with performance issues," the chief of the IT giant was quoted as saying. He also explained that a "skill mismatch" also contributed to some of the layoffs. "We have relieved individuals where we see a skill mismatch for the future. The company is pivoting to be future-ready and a big player in the AI ecosystem. If someone doesn’t fit into the scheme of things, we need to exit them gracefully. This approach, I believe, does not conflict with our ethos," Krithivasan said. The Trump administration, which has described the H-1B programme as the one of the "most abused visa" systems in the US' immigration framework, recently slapped a $100,000 ( ₹88 lakh) fee on fresh applications, sending shockwaves across firms that rely on the programme to employ highly-skilled talent from around the world.

Title: Andrew Ross Sorkin sees worrying signs in market after months of ups

Watch CBS News October 12, 2025 / 7:30 PM EDT / CBS News Stocks took a nosedive on Friday after President Trump threatened a big tariff hike on China. Until then, Wall Street had been at record highs for months, which is why we decided to check in with Andrew Ross Sorkin, one of the country's most influential financial reporters. He's just written a book called "1929" about the market crash a century ago. We wondered if he'd run out of news to cover, or is he alerting us that what's been happening in the markets lately – is a replay of what led to the most devastating financial collapse in our history? Imagine the New York Stock Exchange back then: the crush of frightened traders dumping stocks, investors losing their shirts, businesses, their homes, sweeping away the Roaring '20s, walking that same but transformed floor today. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Everything's digital. Lesley Stahl: Well, yeah, OK. Andrew Ross Sorkin says we're in our own roaring '20s: the 2020s. with stocks climbing for months, just like then. Andrew Ross Sorkin: The crazy part about this is, from 1928 to September of 1929, the stock market was up 90%! Lesley Stahl: When you say the stock market was way up, immediately I think of now. Are you scared? Andrew Ross Sorkin: I'm anxious. I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology and all of that, or everything's overpriced. Lesley Stahl: Or we're reliving-- Andrew Ross Sorkin: 1929. Andrew Ross Sorkin: There was so much anxiety. Sorkin has covered the markets for two decades. He joined the New York Times after college, soon founding the DealBook newsletter covering finance. He also co-hosts "Squawk Box" on CNBC, runs the DealBook Summit, where he interviews the high and mighty, he co-created "Billions" the TV show, wrote a bestseller about the 2008 crash, and now, a book about 1929. Lesley Stahl: We're always being undone by bubbles. There was the internet bubble in 2000, the housing in 2008. Are we in another bubble? An AI bubble or something like that? Andrew Ross Sorkin: I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort. The question is always when is the bubble going to pop? Lesley Stahl: One symptom of a bubble is when the market goes up and up, but the underlying economy – the real economy - goes soft. And that appears to be happening right now. Andrew Ross Sorkin: I would argue to you that the economy is being propped up, almost artificially, by the artificial intelligence boom. There are hundreds of billions of dollars that are being invested today in artificial intelligence. This is either a gold rush or a sugar rush and we probably won't know for a couple of years which one it is. 1929 was a sugar rush caused by speculation and debt. People who didn't really have much money were lured by Wall Street bankers to invest using a newfangled concept to take on debt, called credit. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your broker. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Prior to 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt at all. It was a sin. It was a moral sin to use credit– Lesley Stahl: Oh, really? Andrew Ross Sorkin: --to buy anything. And it was really General Motors that basically came up with the idea that we're gonna lend you money so you can afford to buy our cars. Lesley Stahl: Brilliant. Andrew Ross Sorkin: And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access. And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way. Since then, laws, regulations, and agencies have been put in place to protect investors - especially the less affluent - from being exploited. Lesley Stahl: We put up barriers after 1929. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Protections. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. Lesley Stahl: So those are coming down. They're tumbling down one -- the SEC rules aren't as stringent anymore. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. The Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore. Lesley Stahl: Correct. Andrew Ross Sorkin: That's what concerns me. It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off. Including guardrails that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public. Andrew Ross Sorkin: So over the last 20 or 30 years, folks who had access to, who could invest in private equity, in venture capital, clearly outperformed folks who didn't. And so– Lesley Stahl: That's how you really made money. But you have to remember that these kind of assets are gambles. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that. But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that. Lesley Stahl: Wow. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Isn't this something? Lesley Stahl: This is spectacular. Sorkin took us to the Fifth Avenue mansion of one of the big bankers back then, who pushed democratization. Lesley Stahl: If this idea of bringing a regular guy into buying stock, if that was a big problem back in 1929 why are we going there again? Doesn't it defy some kind of logic? Andrew Ross Sorkin: There is a view that it's been only the elites that have had access to these investments, Facebook before it ever went public, Uber before it went public. So there is this idea that it's unfair, actually, to the ordinary investor because we haven't allowed them to get access to some of these investment opportunities early. And there is a real push, partially by the Trump administration, partially by the industry itself, which wants to– Lesley Stahl: Get more money. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Get more money in-- to open up the market to more and more people. Lesley Stahl: So we have these guardrails for a reason. I mean, they're there to protect, and they have protected. Andrew Ross Sorkin: They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich. Larry Fink: Many people don't believe in capitalism anymore. And I think a lot of it is because they were not a part of the growth of the economy. We went to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the world's biggest money manager, handling $12.5 trillion in assets, like pension funds. His annual letter to investors is a kind of industry roadmap. This latest one he suggested opening our retirement 401(k)s – bastions of caution – to riskier private investments in the name of, wait for it: democratizing investing. Larry Fink: As I wrote, there are many great opportunities to be investing in the s- in startup companies, to invest in AI or data centers. Right now, we're precluded to put those type of assets in many retirement products. And the Trump administration has now said we're going to allow in our 401(k) products the opportunity to invest in these private markets. Lesley Stahl: But, they are risky. Aren't they? Larry Fink: Yes. But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight. Lesley Stahl: But we're talking about 401(k)s. Larry Fink: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Investing out of retirement accounts. Larry Fink: Yes. Lesley Stahl: You're risking the nest egg or part of the-- a little part of the nest egg. Larry Fink: But what the markets will teach you over the last 100 years, even at the worst moments, if you have the ability to persevere and you have a long-term horizon, you're going to do fine. And a diversified portfolio is essential. We're not suggesting, you know, one shoe fits all. We are suggesting the opportunity to have that ability to invest in these private market investments. He also believes we should be investing in crypto. Lesley Stahl: It wasn't that long ago that the big bankers, Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, were saying that crypto was stupid and a fraud. Larry Fink: I did say Bitcoin, because we were talking about Bitcoin then, was the domain of money launderers and thieves. But you know, the markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions. There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is it's an alternative. For those looking to diversify this is not a bad asset, but I don't believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio. But Sorkin says some crypto can be abused in ways similar to 1929. Take meme coins: cryptocurrencies that can be manipulated by speculators who pumped them up, then let them crash. Andrew Ross Sorkin: There are a number of examples where it felt like there was an inside group of people who were colluding to pump up some of these cryptocurrencies, and other things. I'll give you a bizarre story of my own. I was on television with Larry Fink, and he makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it. Lesley Stahl: Are you serious? Andrew Ross Sorkin: Go up, and up, and up, and up, and up. The sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day. Andrew Ross Sorkin: And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day, so… Lesley Stahl: [makes spiral noise] Sorkin is trusted by the world's top business leaders, who talk to him often exclusively. Lesley Stahl: What role do you think these business leaders should be playing now? Andrew Ross Sorkin: My own view is that most CEOs in America today are very scared to speak out publicly about anything. They are so worried that they are going to be potentially attacked by the administration, or regulated. They're gonna have a merger in front of some agency that's not gonna be allowed to go through. They are so nervous about criticizing anything that's going on with this administration. Lesley Stahl: There are some economists who suggest that because Mr. Trump ties his success to the success of the market, that he's not gonna let anything like what happened in 1929 happen. And that we should feel secure because of that. Andrew Ross Sorkin: I think it's hard to know how things get out of control. When confidence disappears, it happens like this. [SNAP] Lesley Stahl: So, you spent nearly 10 years on this book. The inevitable question is: do you think that we will have a crash or not? Andrew Ross Sorkin: The answer is we will have a crash; I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep. But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash. Produced by Shachar Bar-On. Associate producer, Jinsol Jung. Broadcast associate, Aria Een.

October 12, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 24th issue of our Weekly Report. Sorry for showing up in a cap today. I’ve been dealing with a very serious case of shingles on my head these past few days, which has affected my condition a bit. Everyone, please also take good care of your health and get enough rest. On EAI Flywheel this week, starting with S1 User Ecosystem: This week, FX signed a deposit agreement for 1,000 units of FX Super One with ZEVO, the pioneer of peer-to-peer EV sharing platform in the U.S. The agreement includes non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders, and the non-refundable deposit has already been received. The signing of this agreement not only marks that FX’s Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales model has expanded into Texas, the second-largest EV market in the United States. It also represents another innovative breakthrough in our B2B2C sales model. Following the car rental, FX Par, real estate brokerage, and MCN agencies, FX has now also entered the rapidly growing peer-to-peer car-sharing market. Based in Dallas, ZEVO not only allows individual car owners to list their own EVs for user-to-user sharing but also provides flexible short-term rental programs for ride-hailing and instant-delivery drivers. Its business has now expanded to core cities in Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Through the cooperation with ZEVO, FX not only further expands the sales and use cases of FX Super One, but is also expected to speed up the implementation of our co-creation and sharing ecosystem. At the same time, when the car-sharing business and CXC10’s Three Growth Engines spark meta-chemistry — especially through the EAI + Crypto Dual-Bridge RWA products — new possibilities will emerge. The value of real-world mobility will be redefined and expanded in Web3 scenarios. This meta-chemistry could greatly accelerate the convergence of Web2 and Web3, and of EAI and Crypto, creating the greatest value for our stockholders. This week, we also held a "Car Home Crypto Co-Creation" delivery event with Pinnacle. Calvin Gong is our first Co-Creation Officer since we announced the “EAI + Crypto” Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. We look forward to creating meta-chemistry between real estate, automotive, and crypto together with industry leaders like Pinnacle. This could help us co-create greater value and enable users to share more benefits. Now going to S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: The FX Super One U.S. year-end vehicle off-line target has officially entered the final two-month sprint stage. This week, the company established a dedicated project team to coordinate and drive the work. Key areas — including engineering, supply chain, homologation, manufacturing and so on— are all accelerating across the board. On S6 Middle East: Our global teams are working across three locations in full force to prepare for the October 28th UAE Super One Product Final Launch. As the strategic third pole, the UAE will host its major Super One product launch for the first time and take the lead in initial vehicle deliveries — a milestone of great significance for FF and FX’s global strategic layout. The experience gained through this event will also help ensure the smooth progress of the upcoming vehicle off-line and final launch activities in the U.S. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up: This week, members of our government affairs team were invited to attend a gala in Washington D.C. that brought together political, media and entrepreneurial leaders from across the U.S. We continue to strengthen our government affairs capabilities, and they are making progress assisting the company in public sector engagement, policy incentives, tariff strategy, and more. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: Following the completion of the strategic investment in Qualigen (QLGN), the Crypto team has been advancing its business operations while accelerating the transition work. The special meeting of QLGN stockholders is currently scheduled for November 2025. If the transaction is approved, QLGN is expected to be rebranded as CXC10, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Crypto and AI operations for that company. Next week, we will announce a major milestone related to the first FX Super One vehicle off-line target in the United States. Please stay tuned for the update. Okay, I'll see you later.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: The Digital Asset Treasury Playbook: How to Print, Buy and Compound to ‘Alchemise’ mNAV into a Market Engine

Time Published: 2025-10-12T20:21:00Z

About us Copy link Just a couple months ago, digital asset treasuries were crypto’s hottest trade. Spurred by soaring valuations, hundreds of companies raced to accumulate Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The mania has cooled in recent weeks. Companies that saw their stock soar after announcing multimillion-dollar crypto purchases are now trading at a discount relative to that crypto. Still, some are holding strong, with their mNAV — short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple — comfortably in the black. How do the do it? In the LlamaU article below, pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains the drivers of mNAV premiums, as well as examples where the logic behind those premiums “breaks.” (Read Meta’s previous article: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries) DATs are no longer just holding crypto — they’re leveraged to actively expand their own holdings and valuations. They aren’t just ‘hodl’ing tokens; it has become a competitive game of accumulation. DATs are trading their own market caps against themselves, turning investor sentiment into capital and capital into narrative fuel. This new species of equity, known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), sits at the intersection of corporate finance and crypto reflexivity. Their fundamentals are blockchain-based, their premiums narrative-driven, and their strategies systematic: print, buy, compound, repeat. What began as an experiment with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model has evolved into a broader movement spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Today, SBET, BMNR, and others have creatively applied the same reflexive mechanics to staking yield, token diversification, and capital recycling; transforming what used to be static balance sheets into market engines. mNAV = Fully Diluted Market Cap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) 1.0x → equity equals treasury value (fair) > 1.0x → investors pay a premium for leverage, yield, or access < 1.0x → the stock trades at a discount to its underlying crypto If you’re new to mNAV or want a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s calculated, “HYPE DAT Ecosystem: A Clean Case Study for mNAV” is where you want to start. A premium can be narrative-driven, structural, engineered, or yield-supported. When these align, mNAV becomes less a ratio and more a reaction: a positive feedback loop between equity and treasury that refines sentiment into capital. MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model; they codified, refined, and evolved their procedure making them the gold standard. Below is the company’s official equity guidance slide from Exhibit 99.1 (August 2025): MSTR Equity Guidance screenshot MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model. Its strategy slide divides valuation into mNAV zones, each dictating a different capital playbook: - Active: issue equity aggressively to buy more Bitcoin - Opportunistic: issue selectively during favorable sentiment - Tactical: issue sparingly for debt or liquidity needs - Defensive: may use credit to repurchase stock Active issuance expands Bitcoin holdings through ATMs (At-the-Market equity offering, where companies sell newly issued shares directly on to the open market), convertibles, and secondary offerings. Opportunistic issuance occurs briefly, often above 3x mNAV, allowing controlled compounding with minimal dilution. Tactical issuance covers debt or dividends without selling BTC. Defensive stance slows issuance or uses credit to repurchase shares, supporting the stock’s floor and resetting the flywheel. This structure turns capital markets into a feedback engine. When mNAV rises, MicroStrategy issues to buy BTC. When it falls, issuance tightens or reverses through buybacks. Dilution becomes reflexive compounding. The simplest catalyst for premiums or discounts is positioning versus entry cost. When a DAT’s treasury sits above its average purchase price, the market usually assigns a premium (>1x mNAV). Below cost, the market discounts it. Across the DeFiLlama Digital Asset Treasuries dashboard, profitable treasuries consistently trade higher while underwater ones remain cheap. Examples include: - MSTR (MicroStrategy) — BTC Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV ~1.5x) - KIDZ (Classover) — SOL Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV 2.1x–3.5x) - UPXI (Upexi) — SOL Treasury, Max FD lens → mNAV ~1.5x - MARA (Marathon Digital) — BTC + Infrastructure Premium (1.2x–1.7x) - NAKA (Nakamoto Holdings) — High BTC Entry → Discount (0.5x–0.8x) - BTBT (Bit Digital) — ETH Treasury w/ Yield → Premium (>1x) Premiums also form along jurisdictional and regulatory lines — where access or taxation changes valuation dynamics. Metaplanet Inc. (OTC: MTPLF, TSE: 3350.T) is Japan’s flagship Bitcoin treasury and one of the clearest cases of jurisdictional alchemy. Under Japan’s tax code, corporations must mark crypto holdings to market annually and pay tax on unrealized gains. In contrast, capital gains on listed shares are taxed separately at an effective 20.315% (Japan National Tax Agency). This makes Metaplanet (MTPLF) a tax-deferred Bitcoin proxy, letting investors gain BTC exposure through equity. By holding Bitcoin through equity rather than directly, Metaplanet turns that asymmetry into a structural advantage, maintaining a 1.8x–2.0x mNAV with it at its peak having maintained >8x mNAV for weeks on end. A textbook case of tax alchemy: turning friction into premium. DATs in regulated markets can tap capital barred from direct token exposure. MicroStrategy succeeded because it epitomized this: a compliant, levered Bitcoin wrapper for institutions. Formerly CEA Industries, BNB Network Co. (BNC) is one of the few public DATs with direct BNB exposure. With no BNB ETF or trust in the U.S., it serves as a listed proxy for Binance’s ecosystem; similar to how MSTR fulfilled the role early on as the only institutional onramp for BTC exposure. It trades near 1.87x mNAV. Given that it is publicly endorsed and heavily invested into BNB DAT by the venture capital entity YZI Labs, formerly Binance Labs, which is officially funded and partnered with Binance itself. Until a formal BNB ETF exists, that scarcity alone supports the premium. Together, Metaplanet and BNB Network Co. show the geography of premium. Where Metaplanet turns Japan’s crypto tax disadvantage into equity advantage, BNC leverages America’s regulatory bottleneck on BNB exposure. Both convert policy friction into scarcity. Metaplanet provides the purest example of geopolitical arbitrage in the DAT playbook. SBET and BMNR pioneered ETH-based treasuries that generate yield natively. By staking directly on Ethereum, both earn validator-level returns (~3–5% APY) that continuously expand NAV. That yield compounds through feedback: staking generates rewards, NAV expands, the market reprices equity upward, and higher valuations reinforce the premium. The difference lies in the ingredients: mindshare, leadership, and visibility. SBET, with Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, and Joseph Chalom, former Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, has top tier pedigree however BMNR’s Tom Lee has a very public presence with his appearances on CNBC. This ends up likening Tom Lee to MSTR’s legendary Saylor whose loud, consistent, charismatic bullishness were undeniable variables in the success of establishing MicroStrategy as a household name. BMNR paralleled this best for the Ethereum DATS by staying on top via a combination of buybacks, retail engagement, and visible leadership. BTCS also earns ETH staking yield but trades below parity lending proof that yield alone can’t ignite the flywheel without narrative and conviction. Ultimately, yield is the base metal, and narrative, leadership, and timing are the reagents that determine whether it compounds or burns off. Some DATs diversify through moonshot allocations: small, high-beta bets meant to amplify upside or hedge decay. GameSquare (mNAV = ~1.11x) holds ETH, a CryptoPunk, and ANIME token positions. It trades slightly above parity, a modest premium for narrative diversification. BMNR allocated $20M into ORBS (formerly OCTO), a Worldcoin (WLD) DAT, at $1.46/share. By October 2025, ORBS traded above $10, a 6x gain. Clearly, these moonshots can convert asymmetric exposure into subtle mNAV leverage through optionality. Not all DATs follow the “profit = premium” or “association = value” logic. TRON (Ticker: TRON) – Despite profitable reserves and close ties to the TRON blockchain, the stock trades at a steep discount. TRON, which is the only TRX DAT treasury, trades at a 0.53x max fully diluted mNAV, Despite TRX hosting ~$77.5B in stablecoins, composed of ~98% USDT (DeFiLlama), and dominating transfers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in the West, it’s viewed as a transactional rail, not an investable asset, keeping its mNAV deeply discounted. Contrast this with BNB Network Co. (BNC). BNB’s exchange linkage and predictable revenue burns make it behave like equity. Binance uses a share of revenue to buy and burn BNB: a deliberate, showy, aggressive mechanism versus TRX’s passive gas burns. Traditional finance investors quickly recognize the pattern as an equity-like feedback loop, sustaining BNC’s 1.87x mNAV whereas TRX’s gas burning blockchain hasn’t attracted attention to TRON treasury keeping it below parity. Simply put: BNB’s burn program mirrors corporate buybacks, while TRX’s gas burns are passive and minor in comparison. BNC maintains premium; TRON does not. In numerical terms, the contrast between the two when examining max mNAV is astronomical: a difference of over 300%! BTCS, one of the first ETH staking firms, trades around 0.88x mNAV. SBET and BMNR captured attention with clear messaging and buybacks; BTCS remained quieter, focused on infrastructure over narrative. It delivers on-chain results but lacks social reflexivity; proof that legitimacy without visibility still prices like a discount. These cases show DAT premiums are behavioral, not mechanical. Narrative clarity, investor access, and perceived intentionality decide whether association becomes valuation. TRX dominates usage but not mindshare translating to a discount for TRON; BNB’s engineered burn loop mirrors equity translating to a premium for BNC as if accounting for revenue generation; and BTCS shows substance alone isn’t enough. In this market, numbers matter but narratives are the driver for positive multiples. In the DAT ecosystem, premiums aren’t random; they’re engineered. Every successful treasury blends fundamentals, narrative, and structure into a reflexive loop: fundamentals anchor value, narrative amplifies it, and capital strategy turns that feedback into growth. MicroStrategy utilizes financial wizardry to convert sentiment into Bitcoin. Metaplanet and BNC alchemize geography into premium through geopolitical arbitrage. BMNR, SBET, and GAME merge yield and narrative momentum. TRON and BTCS remind us that usage without story rarely sustains a premium. In this financial alchemy, fundamentals are the lead, narrative is the spark, and regulation is the catalyst that determines how brightly it burns.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to The New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.

Title: 5 High Yield CEFs With Steep Discounts Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/12/5-high-yield-cefs-with-steep-discounts-right-now/
Time Published: 2025-10-12T14:00:00Z

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Closed-end funds (CEFs) are the last bargains left on the board. CEFs are often confused with mutual funds and ETFs, but they are different because they often trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). For contrarians like us looking for deals, this is key. CEF trading is relatively thin. This created inefficiencies, such as select CEFs trading for as cheap as 95 or even 90 cents on the dollar. Plus, some of them dish big dividends—like these five. Let’s start with the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (EVT)—a CEF that buys not just common stocks, but also preferred stocks, that distribute qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates; non-qualified dividends, like those paid by most real estate investment trusts (REITs), face less favorable short-term capital gains rates. EVT’s four managers currently hold an 80/20 blend of common and preferred stocks, with the traditional equity “sleeve” made up of about 80 predominantly large-cap stocks. Names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and NextEra Energy (NEE) would be right at home in a bog-standard dividend fund. But while that fund would likely pay 2% or so, EVT delivers 4x that number, at 8% currently. (And it’s a monthly dividend payer, no less.) Part of that high yield we can chalk up to leverage—management borrows additional funds to invest even more money in their picks, which amplifies yields and gains if we’re fortunate, and amplifies losses if we’re not. Leverage currently sits at about 20% of assets. But the other part of it is the nature of those distributions. When Eaton Vance’s fund sends out a monthly distribution, dividend income is only a (small) portion of that. The rest is capital gains, usually of the long-term variety. It’s a “managed” distribution, too—the typical dividend fund’s income will vary from one period to the next, but EVT’s monthly payout hasn’t changed since April 2024, when the CEF raised its distribution by about 11%. The strategy doesn’t give us much of an edge over basic dividend funds, however—at least not longer-term. Right now, valuation is on EVT’s side, as the fund trades at a roughly 8% discount to NAV that’s wider than its longer-term 5% average. Options strategies are popular in CEFLand. Sometimes they’re complementary to the primary strategy, but sometimes they’re the whole point. The latter is the case with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities (ETV). It holds a portfolio of 150, mostly large-cap stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), then sells covered calls on a few major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to generate income, which it distributes to its shareholders monthly. Funds that sell covered calls—especially those where the strategy revolves around it—are designed to limit downside and provide income. On that front, actively managed covered-call strategies like ETV are better than comparable plain-vanilla index ETFs. Better still? We can sometimes buy that protection on the cheap; while ETV tends to trade on par with its NAV, we can buy the fund and its monthly distributions at 94 cents on the dollar. BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust (BOE) is like a mix of ETV and EVT, with global exposure (read: U.S. and international stocks) mixed in. Management has built a roughly 50-stock portfolio that’s currently split 65/35 across U.S. and international stocks, but that blend can and will change over time. When I’ve looked at this fund in past years, I’ve seen it hold as much as half of assets in international stocks, which is higher than the typical global fund. But like ETV and EVT, everything revolves around blue chips. It holds U.S. mega-caps like Microsoft and Broadcom (AVGO), but also developed-market names like AstraZeneca (AZN) and even emerging-market giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alibaba (BABA). International stocks might pay more than domestics, but BOE still yields roughly 3x more than most global ETFs. It’s not leverage, which is vanishingly thin, but a covered call strategy—one that helps fund a monthly distribution north of 8%. We’re not expecting to outperform a basic index over time, but we do expect less volatility and smaller drawdowns. An 8.7% discount to NAV would seem to give us an edge right now, but it’s a shallower markdown than its longer-term 11% average. Many sector ETFs and mutual funds are usually faithful to one slice of the market. We buy technology funds for technology stocks, and bank funds for bank stocks. But CEFs like the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (BCX) aren’t afraid to “cross the streams.” BCX primarily invests in stocks “issued by commodity or natural resources companies,” meaning that the portfolio straddles the energy and materials sectors. The management team has assembled a tight portfolio of just 45 companies including integrated energy majors like Shell (SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), but also metals and minerals specialists like Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX). The fund also may invest in derivatives, and it also sells covered calls to enhance its dividend yield. The result? It’s not always that way. Longer-term, BCX has struggled to capture some of the biggest moves in metals, at least in part because of its covered-call strategy. Like with many CEFs, the best chance for success is buying while the fund is cheap. We can currently buy BlackRock’s fund for a 6% discount, but it’s not really a deal compared to its long-term average discount of 10%. We get a more targeted energy play (and the highest yield of the bunch, at nearly 10%) from the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Co-Managers Peter Vanderlee and Patrick McElroy own just 20 companies. But it’s a who’s who of midstream companies (firms that operate pipelines, storage, terminals and other energy assets), including regular stocks such as Targa Resources (TRGP) and ONEOK (OKE), as well as master limited partnerships (MLPs) such as Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). Unlike with the other CEFs mentioned above, EMO’s holdings do a lot of the talking as it pertains to the monthly distribution. MLPs are among some of the highest-yielding securities in the stock market. But the fund still pays more than most MLP ETFs thanks to high leverage of nearly 30%. EMO trails its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index—represented in the chart below by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)—by 30 percentage points since inception in 2011. But since 2023 EMO has nearly doubled the return of AMLP, thanks to its aggressive leverage. EMO has the deepest discount on this list—we currently can buy shares at 91 cents on the dollar. But thanks to its hot performance, it’s actually expensive in historical terms, trading well above its longer-term 15% average discount.

After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday. With the federal government shutdown heading into its third week, the blackout on economic data releases is likely to continue. The Thursday reports on U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims and Friday’s update on housing starts could be delayed by the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it plans to release on Oct. 24 the Consumer Price Index inflation report for September that was originally scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak, coming as the central bank is set to release its Beige Book economic update on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell is due to give an economic update on Tuesday, with remarks also expected this week from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Some data releases are still expected, including a survey of small business optimism on Tuesday and report on homebuilder confidence on Thursday.

Title: I was laid off by Microsoft and can't find a job. I'm weeks away from giving up my apartment and moving across the country to live with family.

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ian Carter, a 33-year-old job seeker in Redmond, Washington, who previously worked as a technical program manager at Microsoft. It has been edited for length and clarity. On May 13, I was getting lunch at a Panera Bread when I just happened to check my email. When I read it, it felt like a gut punch. I'd been laid off from my Microsoft job. My mind started racing. Could I have done something different? Could I have been better? However, I eventually realized it was simply a business decision. I'd seen the company lay off a lot of people in recent years, and it felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not — everybody was at risk. When I was laid off, I was on medical leave for a personal health issue and had been planning to return to work in the coming days. I collected my last paycheck in mid-July and then received some severance pay, but I started applying for jobs almost immediately. My mindset was "I can cry while I apply." I decided to share that I'd been laid off on LinkedIn, and the post received over 115,000 impressions. I began receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities, and I've landed interviews at companies that include Disney and Nintendo. But it's now been five months since my layoff, and I'm still looking for a job. I've been drawing on my savings to pay the bills and renting my one-bedroom apartment on a month-to-month lease for about $2,700 — all while crossing my fingers that I land a role soon. My lease ends the week of October 20, and if I don't have a job offer by then, I'm planning to move across the country to Florida to live with my family and save money until I find a job. Rent is expensive, but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share about struggling to find work, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, via Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out this quick form.

Read more on the topic: If I had to guess why I, along with many others at Microsoft and other Big Tech companies, have been laid off in recent years, I'd point to two factors: overhiring during the pandemic and massive investments in AI. Whatever the reason, it's clear that finding a job in tech has become significantly more difficult. Before my layoff, I regularly heard from college students struggling to break into the industry. The market already seemed tougher than when I graduated — and now, I'm seeing that firsthand. I'm in a spot where I have nearly four years of full-time experience — not quite a new grad, but not senior level, either. I think some companies are looking for one or the other, which has made my search harder. Others are seeking very specific skill sets, while mine can sometimes be viewed as more generalist. As I've searched for work, I've been trying to develop my AI skills, as job postings suggest that companies are increasingly valuing this expertise. Working at Microsoft also gave me insight into the value of AI skills. During my last year, I didn't personally feel that my performance expectations had risen too much, but I did feel some pressure to find ways to incorporate AI into my work. During my job search, I've tried to replicate the strategies that got me to this point in my career. I dropped out of high school in 2009 for health-related reasons, but I eventually earned my GED and enrolled at a community college, where I earned my associate degree and then went on to attend Florida State University. During this period, I built my network on LinkedIn — I now have more than 8,700 followers — which helped me secure interviews and ultimately land an internship at Salesforce. A company recruiter reached out to me, which is how I learned about the role and landed an interview. Having the internship on my résumé helped me land full-time interviews after graduation. I had a list of dream companies — including Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix — and I applied to a program manager role at Microsoft without a referral. After an interview, I eventually received a job offer. In 2021, I graduated from Florida State with a bachelor's degree in computer science and began working remotely for Microsoft due to the pandemic. In 2022, I moved to Redmond, Washington — where the company is headquartered — and before I was laid off, I had a six-figure salary. As I've searched for work — targeting program manager, project manager, and product management roles — I've tried to rely on my existing network and make new connections. When I see a role that interests me, I reach out to the recruiter or someone with a similar job title at the company and ask what they think their company is looking for in a candidate. I then tailor my résumé accordingly. Since I have a LinkedIn Premium account, I have more visibility into who views my profile. If they have an interesting job title, I'll send them a message. Most of the time, they respond because they recall visiting my page, which leads to a conversation. When I connect with people, I usually ask for advice rather than a referral. But if someone offers to give me one, I gladly accept. While these connections have helped me land some interviews, I'm still looking for a job offer. Going forward, my plan is to continue doing what I'm doing — applying for jobs, networking as much as possible, and developing my AI skills. However, if my job search drags on, I might consider pursuing a graduate degree, such as an MBA or a degree related to AI. In addition to networking for job opportunities, I've also reached out to others who've been laid off to discuss our shared experiences. Layoffs take a mental toll, and it's nice to talk to people who can relate. I sometimes visit the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout the company's history. It's always interesting to read about what others are going through and their stories. It makes me feel like I'm not alone. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.
