Pete Hegseth said Chinese control of ports lets Beijing conduct surveillance activities. By Taejun Kang for RFA 2025.04.09 TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's control of Panama Canal ports is an unacceptable threat to U.S. security, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a visit to the central American nation, underlining U.S. efforts to bolster its influence in the Western hemisphere. The Panama Canal has become a focal point of geopolitical tension, as China's involvement in its ports raises U.S. concerns over control and influence in a key global trade route. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly said that the United States is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations. Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-funded dock at the Vasco NuÃ±ez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama's President JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal's operations. "To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defence and security cooperation than we have in decades," he said. China-based companies, Hegseth said, continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area. "That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable." In response to Hegseth's remarks, the Chinese embassy in Panama slammed the U.S. government in a statement on X. It said the U.S. has used "blackmail" to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a "sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn't have the right to interfere in." "The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the 'theoretical Chinese threat' in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests," the embassy said. There have been growing calls in Washington for action to loosen Beijing's influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over ports in Panama and elsewhere in the Western hemisphere. China and the U.S. are also waging a tit-for-tat trade battle, which threatens to stunt the global economy. The U.S. now imposes a 104% tariff on Chinese imports after a series of tariff hikes this year. On Feb. 3, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened the Panamanian leader with potential American retaliation if his country didn't immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. The Panamanian government said that it was auditing the lease held by the Hong Kong consortium, which operates ports at both ends of the canal, and late on Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, had already announced that CK Hutchison Holdings would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. âCK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, has operated the Balboa and CristÃ³bal ports at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the Panama Canal through its subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, since the late 1990s. In March 2025, CK Hutchison agreed to sell a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., as part of a US$22.8 billion deal that includes control over 43 ports in 23 countries. At that time, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said concerns about the deal "deserve serious attention," possibly hinting at some form of legal action. "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations," Lee told journalists in Hong Kong. The Chinese territory would handle any commercial transaction "according to the law," he said. "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," Lee said.

AP AP PANAMA CITY — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats from China but that together the United States and Panama will keep it secure. Hegseth’s remarks triggered a fiery response from the Chinese government, which said: “Who represents the real threat to the Canal? People will make their own judgement.” Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama President José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Advertisement Advertisement “To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said. Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc. “China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.” Hegseth met with Mulino for two hours Tuesday morning before heading to the naval base that previously had been the U.S. Rodman Naval Station. On the way, Hegseth posted a photo on X of the two men laughing and said it was an honor speaking with Mulino. “You and your country’s hard work is making a difference. Increased security cooperation will make both our nations safer, stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. Late Tuesday, Mulino and Hegseth released a joint statement. A vaguely worded portion of the statement suggested the two had discussed the tolls the United States pays for its ships crossing the canal. It said that within the canal’s framework, “the Republic of Panama and the United States of America will work, as established, on a mechanism to compensate for the payment of tolls and charges.” Panama’s Foreign Relations Ministry did not immediately answer a request for clarification. But the Spanish and English versions had at least one significant discrepancy. The Spanish version included that “Secretary Hegseth recognized the leadership and inalienable sovereignty of Panama over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas.” That sentence appeared nowhere in the English version. The visit comes amid tensions over Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations—allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after the meeting, the Chinese Embassy in Panama slammed the American government in a statement on X, saying the U.S. has used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” “The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United State’s own geopolitical interests,” the embassy wrote. After Hegseth and Mulino spoke by phone in February, the U.S. State Department said that an agreement had been reached to not charge U.S. warships to pass through the canal. Mulino publicly denied there was any such deal. Trump has gone so far as to suggest the U.S. never should have turned the canal over to Panama and that maybe that it should take the canal back. The China concern was provoked by the Hong Kong consortium holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, has already announced that CK Hutchison would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Mulino during a visit in February that Trump believes China’s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the U.S. to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal. Mulino has denied that China has any influence in the operations of the canal. In February, he expressed frustration at the persistence of the narrative. “We aren’t going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries,” he said. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. “I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

East Asia United States President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for America to “reclaim” the Panama Canal from what he termed “China control”. Panamanian Moises Castillo (L) in Beijing, and Chinese national Zhou Mei in her office in Panama overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BEIJING: Shipping business owner Zhou Mei’s videos on Chinese social media application WeChat have been getting more attention lately. The 49-year-old Chinese national regularly posts snippets of her work and family life in Panama, including views from her office of ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal. In recent weeks, the vital waterway – through which 5 per cent of all global shipping passes – has made headlines and, in turn, drawn viewers to Zhou. Shortly before United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, he announced his intention to “take back” the Panama Canal from what he termed “China control”. Since then, he has ramped up calls for the US to “reclaim” it. During a visit to Panama on Tuesday (Apr 8), US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that America will not allow China and other nations to "threaten the canal's operation or integrity". Amid this ongoing tussle between Beijing and Washington over the strategic trade route, Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing became the latest to be caught in the middle. Li’s logistics conglomerate CK Hutchison said last month that it planned to sell dozens of its ports, including two located at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock. The deal – worth more than US$19 billion in cash – triggered an angry reaction from Beijing, which claimed the company “betrayed” China. All this has put the tiny country of Panama with a population of 4.5 million people on the map. The fight over the strategic trade route has not just impacted big businesses – it has also affected those like Zhou, as well as young Panamanians studying in China. Married to a Panamanian, Zhou told CNA that she expanded her shipping business in Shanghai to the Latin American nation in 2004. This was way before Chinese presence at the Panama Canal surged and before Panama switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2017. Zhou said Trump gave Panama “free advertisement all over the world”. “For China, we have so many shipping companies that have a lot of business dealings with Panama. Your logistics, your shipping service and your fleets have to go through the Panama Canal - the channel to Latin America,” she noted. Her online videos have also been her way of staying in touch with loved ones, especially when she was unable to return to China for four years during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I really want to use this (social media) channel, not only to let my family but also to let my many shipping customers know about Panama, including many of my good friends,” she added. “They don't know about Panama's tourism resources, so for me, it is a very good opportunity.” On the other hand, Panamanian undergraduate Moises Castillo has not found a reason to celebrate his country’s newfound fame. The 23-year-old, who is in his second year of university in Beijing, is among many young Panamanians granted a Chinese government scholarship to study in China. While he had offers from schools in other countries, including the US, he said he chose to study civil engineering in China due to its affordability and potential opportunities. Job offers have already landed at his doorstep from Chinese companies operating in Panama. “Panama is a developing country, so we need a lot of infrastructure like bridges (and) railways. I was thinking it’s a good opportunity and at that time, China was also investing a lot in Latin America with infrastructure projects, so I was thinking I could work in some of these in the future,” he added. But Castillo said he grew concerned when he first heard the news that Panama was pulling out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The trillion-dollar infrastructure programme operates in more than 100 countries. "I was kind of sad, frustrated and a little bit worried,” he added. “If the relationship between China and Panama is difficult, how is that going to affect my future? … How is that going to affect me having a scholarship here?” It was against this backdrop that China reacted strongly to Hong-Kong listed CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama port operations to BlackRock. Panama lies more than 14,000km away from Beijing, across the Pacific Ocean, and has been called the gateway to South America for its key geographic role in terms of connectivity and trade. China is Panama’s largest trading partner and is keen to deepen connections there, in its bid for resources like lithium and other agricultural products like soybean and corn. Beijing is also the second-biggest customer of the Panama Canal after Washington, with about a fifth of the cargo that passes through the waterway belonging to China. CK Hutchinson’s deal with BlackRock was ultimately not signed last week as planned, after China announced an antitrust review of the agreement. Analysts said Beijing’s diplomatic victory over the Panama Canal will likely motivate the Trump administration to repeat the stunt. Meanwhile, one expert predicted that 20 to 30 countries could follow Panama in dropping out of the Belt and Road Initiative within the next year. "What's important are the politics and the optics,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project. “One cannot overstate how important this is - that forcing a country to withdraw from BRI, and seeing the reaction that Trump and (US Secretary of State) Marco Rubio got in the United States among their base, is going to motivate them to (force) dozens of other countries (to also withdraw from BRI).” Olander added that “vulnerable countries” will have to decide whether to be in China’s or America’s “sphere of influence”. Still, he said this would not detract from the BRI’s longer-term strategy. “It just means they have to recalibrate in a much more contentious environment. The first and foremost priority for (Chinese President) Xi Jinping today is protecting the domestic economy,” he noted. “He’s got to keep that domestic economy moving forward, and so I think the US-China relationship is more important than the China-Panama relationship. So, they're kind of going to let Panama go.” Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Title: Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass says any price hikes related to tariffs will be ‘surgical’

Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Michelle Gass said that any price hikes the company makes due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs would be “surgical.” Gass, on an earnings call Monday, told analysts that the situation around tariffs is “very new” and “fluid” and that the company is just “getting our arms around it.” She stopped short of specifying what those price increases would look like, saying “as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it will be very surgical,” Gass said during the call. Gass took over the helm in 2024 as the struggling retailer announced a multiyear global productivity initiative to turn around the business and boost profitability. Under the initiative, called Project Fuel, the retailer plans to optimize its operating model and structure, redesign business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs while simplifying processes across the organization. It has since laid off dozens of workers out of its California office, and warned that more could come. With tariffs adding to its woes, Gass told analysts Monday that the company has assembled a task force to assess “the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate,” which could include “structural changes.” The company sources from 28 countries, 20 of which are imported into the U.S. However, Gass said the company’s supply chain “is more agile today than it ever has been” and that it “pivots” all the time. “We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term,” Gass said. Business executives have warned of the potential impact tariffs could have on the U.S. economy. These high-waisted jeans will take you from day to night all spring and summer long. Dark wash, quality denim for less than $150? We’re in! Stock up on an elite pair of denim shorts before the weather gets warm. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Monday that the stock market could see declines deepen due to uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession. Also on Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders that the levies are likely to “increase inflation” on both foreign and domestic goods, and raised concerns over what their impact will be on America’s economic alliances.

Tata Steel Nederland announces major transformation programme to enhance competitiveness for a sustainable future Stock fell over 2%. Infosys announced it is extending its strategic collaboration with AIB, a financial services group operating predominantly in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. Stock ends nearly 2% lower RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. Responding to the rate cut by 25 bps by RBI, Mr Shailesh Chandra, President, SIAM and Managing Director of Tata Passenger Vehicles Ltd & Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd. said, “Reduction in rates at this time, would have a positive impact on the Auto Sector, as it will increase accessibility by reducing the financing costs, thereby creating a positive sentiment across the market Sanjay Agarwal, Founder, MD & CEO of AU Small Finance Bank “RBI’s announcement of a 25-bps rate cut in the repo rate along with a change in monetary policy stance to ‘accommodative’ from ‘neutral’ is a welcome step. Heightened geoeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty triggered by the recent tariff announcements is bound to have some adverse spillover impact on growth, even though India would remain relatively insulated vis-à-vis some of the other countries. The display of sensitivity and alertness to these seismic global shifts by the RBI is comforting. Going forward, a benign inflation outlook for FY26 on the back of a normal monsoon and soft commodity prices enhances the scope for incremental policy easing. For banks, the visibility of rate cuts along with the recent improvement in liquidity and Assurance by RBI to provide adequate liquidity for growth abodes well. This should help in lowering the overall interest rates in the economy, improve the credit-deposit balance and aid the overall growth impulse. To summarise amidst the global turmoil, we welcome the policy focus on long-term macro stability.” Harsh Dugar, Executive Director, Federal Bank “The policy recognises the macroeconomic risks and the likely impact of trade wars, has clearly shown the intent to support growth(although the estimate has been revised downward) given the contained benign inflation environment. The reduction in the repo rate will lower borrowing costs, stimulate investment, and ultimately contribute to sustained economic growth. We expect the RBI to remain supportive on liquidity to support transmission in interest rates and support credit growth .”. Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner, Forvis Mazars in India “The RBI’s rate cut is a timely step to keep the economy on track as global uncertainties rise. Banks are well-placed to lend more actively, and with inflation expected to ease further, consumers could feel more confident about big-ticket purchases. Many sectors are going to benefit from the rate cut. With borrowing costs now slightly lower, homebuyers and developers could find more breathing room, giving a welcome push to the real estate sector. On the rural side, strong farm activity is likely to boost income levels, which may support spending in smaller towns and help keep consumption steady. RBI’s stance has shifted from neutral to accommodative now, which means RBI may go for another 25-bps cut in the second half of 2025, especially as the focus gradually shifts toward reviving demand and encouraging investment in a slowing global environment. Overall, the policy balances caution with action, aiming to protect growth without losing sight of inflation risks.” Piyush Baranwal, Sr. Fund Manager, WhiteOak Capital AMC on RBI MPC announcement*. “MPC today delivered a second rate cut in successive meeting while also finally changing the policy stance from neutral to accommodative, thus giving further clarity on the trajectory of rates going ahead. Continued tariff wars could diminish growth globally, India included. This may depress prices of goods impacted by tariff walls as well as prices of various commodities, causing India’s inflation to remain under check. Together, these open up room for further rate cuts from RBI to the tune of 50 bps in the coming months, though the same can change quickly on either side given the elevated uncertainty. Pertinent to note here that current lower spreads for Indian G-Secs vs. the US treasury when compared to the past may not necessarily be an impediment in these spreads narrowing further. This is on account of the unique issues plaguing the US bonds such as elevated fiscal deficit, compounded by potentially diminished inclination of global central banks and other investors in buying US treasuries unlike in the past. This is due to the seemingly erratic behavior from the US government, which has upended the globally established norms of trade and investments for both friends and foes alike, causing anxiety in the minds of the global community. Given the indications of continued policy easing and comfortable liquidity from RBI, we believe longer duration bonds as well as spread assets should likely outperform going forward.“ Divam Sharma, smallcase Manager, CEO & Co-Founder at Green Portfolio “The softening of crude oil prices and the US dollar has certainly helped the broader fight against inflation. This trend has further strengthened the case for the RBI to consider rate cuts and shift focus toward supporting growth. Now, looking at the global picture—China is likely to face increasing challenges in exporting to the US. However, it will continue to manufacture at scale. As a result, the surplus goods not going to the US will be redirected to large consumer markets like India. India, in turn, is gradually opening up to Chinese imports, which could lead to cheaper goods flowing into the country. This increase in supply and competition can further help in keeping inflation in check. Additionally, the fall in crude oil and other commodity prices, especially in a low-growth global environment, adds another positive layer to the inflation outlook. That said, there is a flip side- domestic industries that are either trying to restrict imports, substitute them, or rely heavily on exports may feel some pressure. Their margins could be dented in the short term. However, a reduction in interest rates would provide a strong push for domestic businesses. It would lower borrowing costs and incentivize investment, which is crucial for sustaining growth momentum. All in all, this is a welcome move. While the short term may remain volatile, the long-term prospects look promising. With falling interest rates, opportunities to replicate China’s manufacturing model, cheaper imports, and potential for new bilateral trade agreements, the outlook for India over the next six months and beyond is quite encouraging. The move was largely on expected lines, with the RBI maintaining a wait-and-watch stance. We anticipate inflation to remain subdued, creating room for further rate cuts—potentially one or two more over the course of this year. While the short term may see some volatility, as the RBI has also acknowledged, the medium to long-term growth outlook remains strong. This is supported by robust domestic consumption and emerging export opportunities, driven by improving trade relations with many of the world’s major consumer markets.” Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital on RBI MPC announcement “The challenging global economic situation resulting from Trump Tariffs is likely to result in global economic slowdown. While India’s economy is insulated to a large extent from global economy, it is bound to be impacted by the global slowdown, albeit to a lesser extent, compared to other more export-oriented economies. Under these circumstances RBI’s rate cut is supportive of domestic growth and is welcome. Since the global challenges could last for several quarters to years, continued growth-supportive policy stance is expected in the near future from RBI. Reduced domestic interest rates put pressure on the INR towards depreciation. However, given that the crude oil prices are also crashing on the back of expected global slowdown, a depreciating INR would not be that much of a concern from oil imports point of view, but would actually be helpful in exports given the increased competitiveness required due to the tariffs.” Suresh Darak, Founder, Bondbazaar* Global volatility & huge uncertainty, due to unilateral final imposition of trade tariffs by the US, has led to wild movements on rates globally. For instance the US 10 yr Treasury yield has gone up by ~25bps overnight. Tariffs, if continued for long, should be inflationary on the immediate basis while it’d slow demand in the medium term. RBI seems to be trying to move past the tariff noise and addressing the demand slowdown concern with the repo rate cut of 25bps and change of stance to accommodative. Interesting times are up ahead over the next 1-2 months, and the US govt. actions will significantly impact rates globally including in India. “Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has delivered a 25 bp rate cut changing the stance to accommodative from neutral with a greater confidence of convergence and a durable alignment of headline inflation with a target of 4% over a year horizon going forward. With the comfort of more predictable inflation trajectory aligned to the target range; the need to support both consumption and investment led growth has taken a centre stage and the subsequent MPC decisions will be growth centric in the near term. An accommodative stance entails easy monetary policy that is geared towards stimulating the economy through softer interest rates. While the governor, in his statement, has stated that stance directly provides the policy rate guidance, without any direct guidance on liquidity management; he has also mentioned that liquidity management serves as an important operating tool with the RBI for various purposes including monetary policy transmission. Taking clues from this, we expect the regulator to provide sufficient durable liquidity as we move ahead in FY26 for an effective and efficient transmission of the rate cuts to wider sections of Economy. 10-year government bond yield is expected to hover in the range of 6.35% - 6.50% during the rest of Q1 FY 26. The CD curve, which is used as a base curve for pricing bulk deposits, has significantly come off; further the asset curve is likely to get softened primarily driven by sections of loans linked to external benchmarks.” -- Mandar Pitale, Head Treasury, SBM Bank India Vaibhav Porwal, Co-Founder, Dezerv. “In today’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 25-basis-point reduction in the repo rate—from 6.25% to 6.00%. Additionally, the MPC changed its stance from neutral to accommodative, clearly signalling support for growth through potential future rate cuts. This move is in line with our market expectations. It’s important to note that this stance change does not directly imply increased liquidity; however, RBI has confirmed it will continue to manage liquidity as needed. Key takeaways: ● Policy outlook: In the coming months, provided there are no significant economic shocks, we anticipate the MPC will either maintain current rates or implement additional rate cuts. We expect an additional 50–75 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, depending on global factors and tariff developments. ● Growth forecast: GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downwards to 6.5% from 6.7%, reflecting cautious investment and spending due to ongoing uncertainty. However, urban consumption shows signs of gradual improvement. ● Inflation outlook: CPI inflation for FY26 is now projected at 4.00%, slightly down from the previous forecast of 4.20%. Lower crude oil prices have positively contributed to this improved inflation outlook. Additionally, the RBI announced several non-monetary measures aimed at strengthening the financing ecosystem—these include enabling securitisation of stressed assets, extending co-lending guidelines to all regulated entities, and issuing fresh regulations on gold loans and partial credit enhancement. With falling interest rates, bond prices are likely to rise, benefiting short to medium-term bonds. We anticipate further rate reductions in upcoming MPC meetings, and fixed-income investors should lock in currently elevated yields through medium-term bonds. Investing now enables you to secure these higher returns before they potentially decrease further.” Vipul Bhowar, Senior Director - Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors “(RBI) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced a 25 bps reduction in the repo rate, bringing it to 6%. It also changed its policy stance from “neutral” to “accommodative.” The inflation outlook has improved decisively. As projected, there is now greater confidence in the durable alignment of headline inflation with the target of 4% over a 12-month horizon, though the impact of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs continues to loom large. Given the challenges of slower growth in the Indian economy, the central bank was anticipated to persist in modifying its policies to promote stability.” Phoenix Mills: Q4FY25 business update The company reported retailer sales/ consumption growth of 15% YoY to ₹3,262 cr in the period.

The revision of stance to accommodation will cushion the secondary impact of tariffs on domestic economy. With inflation under check, growth imperatives will take precedence in FY26. On the regulation side market-based securitization framework for stressed assets, review of policy on gold lending and non-fund-based facility are timely. Widening of co-lending framework gives wider choices to all parties concerned” Shares of Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever, Hero Motocorp, Titan and Tata Consumer Products traded among major gainers, while Wipro, Trent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel depreciated. Top gainers & losers today: Banking stocks fell, including NBFCs Cholamandalam, IIFL Finance, Muthoot Finance, Manappuram Finance as RBI revised repo rate and aims to issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms for gold loans. With inflation forecast for FY26 at 4% the focus of RBI has completely shifted on the GDP growth as numbers got revised downwards to 6.5% from earlier 6.7%. RBI not only reduced interest rates by 25 bps but also changed its stance to accommodative from neutral. Inflation to remain under control as forecast of normal monsoon, record production of wheat and higher production of key pulses will ensure durable softening of food inflation. Also fall in crude oil price will keep inflation under check. If inflation remains under/around 4% for FY26 then the real rate at 200 bps is on the higher side and mostly will be reduced by cutting interest rates further. However RBI would want to keep its arsenal intact if there is any disruption in the world order due to a tariff war. We believe RBI will watchfully go for couple of more cuts in little over as many policy meets. 10 year bond yield may not show immediate correction but this policy has defined the near-term ceiling for it. “The RBI’s policy stance is clearly supportive of the fixed income markets. The continued focus on maintaining liquidity surplus—through both operational tools such as ₹80,000 crore in OMOs—underscores its accommodative approach. The money market rates should come down. While some seasonal tightness in liquidity is expected post-April, we believe the RBI’s proactive management will ensure that the overall environment remains conducive to credit flow and financial stability. There is a risk of tariff war, which we need to watch out. However, since oil prices are down and commodity prices are in control, inflation risk is lower. There could be another 50 basis point rate cut during the rest of the year “The additional 25-basis points rate cut to 6% by the Reserve Bank of India is a significant step in supporting growth and completely in line with the industry’s expectations. As I had mentioned earlier, since nearly 80% of Aadhar Housing Finance’s existing borrowers are on floating rates this reduction will benefit them. At some stage soon this will lead to reduction in Aadhar RPLR thereby reducing EMI burden. The only wait now is for the banks to pass on this benefit to us. Furthermore, many first-time buyers in the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG) segments will now find it easier to take that crucial step towards home ownership as this move directly translates into lower EMIs and improved affordability. This proactive liquidity support from the central bank clubbed with government initiatives like PMAY 2.0, (SWAMIH) 2.0 fund, income tax exemptions, the introduction of a mortgage guarantee fund will positively accelerate housing demand and aid to government’s vision of housing for all.” The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to shift to an accommodative stance and cut the repo rate by 25 basis points is a welcome move amid global economic uncertainties. This signals the central bank’s proactive approach to support growth and liquidity in the economy, especially in light of potential headwinds such as escalating trade tensions and counter tariffs. The reduction in borrowing costs along with tax cuts announced in budget is expected to boost consumption demand, especially in interest-rate sensitive segments. This can also support discretionary spending, which could aid sectors like auto, consumer durables, and housing. This move can also help India’s relative economic outperformance versus global peers, given the backdrop of a slowing global economy. However, market sentiment was dented by the RBI’s mention of revised gold loan guidelines, which has triggered uncertainty. NBFCs and banks with a strong gold loan portfolio witnessed sharp corrections. The “risk-off” mood among investors, driven by regulatory overhang, contributed to the sell-off. The fact that the guidelines are open for comments and review adds a layer of unpredictability to earnings visibility for these companies. While the policy stance is supportive of growth and liquidity, sector-specific regulatory risks—especially in the gold loan segment—are creating near-term volatility. Investors and stakeholders will be closely watching for clarity on gold loan norms, which could help in reassessing valuations and risk appetite for financials exposed to this segment. The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its policy stance to ‘accommodative’ signals a clear intent to support growth amid rising global uncertainties. With inflationary pressures easing—largely due to lower crude and food prices—and downside risks to growth becoming more pronounced post the recent US tariff hikes, this policy move was timely and expected. The change in stance strengthens the case for a continued easing cycle. We expect this to translate into lower borrowing costs, particularly benefiting rate-sensitive sectors such as housing, automobiles, and MSMEs. Real estate, in particular, stands to gain as improved affordability may drive homebuyer sentiment and spur new demand. While the RBI has revised its GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5%, external challenges, including trade disruptions and climate-related volatility, may exert further pressure. The outlook for inflation remains manageable at 4%, supported by expectations of a normal monsoon, though risks from extreme weather events must be closely watched. Overall, the policy action reflects a calibrated approach—balancing growth support with macroeconomic stability—and sets the tone for a data-driven, accommodative monetary trajectory in the months ahead.

Jeffrey D. Sachs, renowned economist and Columbia University professor, said, “If we had the Indian Supreme Court, I would not have worried frankly. The Indian Supreme Court is pretty activist — it would strike this down as an enormous presidential overreach. I don’t know about our Supreme Court.” Speaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2025, Sachs sharply criticised the growing concentration of power in the hands of the US President and warned that America is slipping into one-man rule. Referring to former President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers, he said, “The President of the US declared an emergency. Now this is interesting, he claims that he can declare an emergency and then govern without law and just govern with decree.” Sachs added, “Now what he calls an emergency is anything that Donald Trump wants to call an emergency. So he calls our trade deficit an emergency. Well, no, it has been around for 20 some years, it has deep economic causes. It is not something that one person should decide and then override the laws of the land in an emergency decree.” He warned that such actions have left the US “profoundly destabilised”, and questioned whether democratic institutions would respond: “We don’t know whether the courts will be able to enforce a judgment that these actions are illegal, which they plainly are… or whether Congress will wake up and say, hey, we have a rule under Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution, which says very explicitly that the right to levy duties belongs only to the Congress, not to the President.” The professor did not mince words, stating, “We don’t know at this moment if the US is a one-person rule or a democracy with checks and balances. Maybe we will have a coup now, we don’t know. Americans voted for Trump to be ruled as per constitution, not as per decree.”On the foreign policy front, Sachs advised India to remain cautious about its strategic alignment with the US. “American friendships have ended up destroying countries. India should be careful, there is no alliance. India is too big for alliance. Being the most populous country, India needs to take care of its relations,” he said. Sachs alleged that Washington seeks to use India as a counterweight to China: “US wants to use India to beat up China. Don’t play the American game is my advice. US foreign policy is divide and rule for every country in the world. India is too big for the US game. US wants India to bash China, to be part of QUAD.” While we await the revised draft, it is good that the RBI is revisiting the partial credit enhancement guidelines as the segment did not scale up given the restrictions in existing guidelines. Some of the challenges included the capping of the partial credit enhancement only 20% of bond issue though capital requirements were significantly higher in relation to the guarantee provided and limited / back-ended amortization of credit enhancement resulting in guarantee fees outweighing the benefits of cost reduction upon rating enhancement. While we await the details, guidelines to harmonise gold loan practices across lenders augurs well for the segment, given the sharp growth in loan book driven by the gold prices and favourable demand dynamics, as unsecured and personal credit slowed since H2FY2024. With the elevated gold prices at present and the currently favourable risk profiles of the NBFCs in this space, considering the liquid nature of the security, the near-term impact on account of regulatory tightening should be manageable. However, competitive pressures for NBFCs could increase going forward, which remains monitorable. “The RBI has reduced the repo rate by 25 bps and at 6% now indeed delivered on the relief front, and the central bank is ahead of the curve with its policy measures to combat the uncertainties post due to global tariff war. The central bank has provided relief on the rate front for the second consecutive time. The rate cut is complemented well by the change in policy stance from neutral to accommodative. The change in stance indicates the readiness of the central bank to act as per the prevailing situation. Other than the rate cut and policy stance change, the commentary on inflation indicating further softening of inflation due to better crop production and above normal monsoon expectations. The RBI has now cut rates by 50 bps in the current calendar year, a move which is expected to further boost demand for real estate. Lower interest rates are anticipated to propagate better home loan affordability, eventually accelerating housing demand in varied ticket segments. The other measures like RBI allowing securitisation of stressed assets and co-lending between regulated entities and beyond priority sector, along with ample system liquidity will help boost the credit growth in the system. Barring the tariff war, geopolitical tensions, most economic indicators are positive, including inflation, GDP growth and a normal monsoon year.” RBI delivers on expectations: RBI cuts rates, changes stance, and provides comfort on inflation projection. Takeaways: 1. As expected by market participants, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut Repo rate by 25 bps, bringing the Repo rate to 6.00%, Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) at 5.75% and Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) at 6.25%. 2. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also changed its stance to ‘Accommodative’ (from ‘Neutral’). 3. The principal driver for the rate cut and change in stance were RBI’s expectations of a benign inflation trajectory and the need to support moderating economic growth. 4. RBI lowered its Gross Domestic Production (GDP) projection for FY 25-26 to 6.50% (Vs 6.70% earlier). RBI also lowered its FY25-26 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation forecast to 4.00% (Vs its earlier forecast of 4.20%) 5. RBI expressed its view of a moderating growth and softening of inflation of the coming months, which bodes well for bond markets. However, it also reiterated the need for vigilance at this juncture, given the risks posed by the rising uncertainties regarding global macro-economic conditions and its potential impact on domestic conditions. 6. As opposed to expectations of some market participants, RBI did not give any express guidance on market liquidity, but noted the present positive systemic liquidity conditions and reiterated its commitment to proactively The Reserve Bank of India announced a 25-basis point rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6% from 6.25% which is in line with market expectations. The policy stance has shifted from &#39;neutral&#39; to &#39;accommodative&#39;, indicating the possibility of further rate hikes. The RBI assured that liquidity will be infused as required, offering comfort to the markets. Forward projections may remain optimistic, with inflation expected to stay around 4% and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth projected at 6.5%. Given the benign inflation outlook, the RBI is likely to focus on growth through monetary stimulus measures. Overall, the policy is viewed as positive for fixed income markets. Equity markets extended their morning losses in mid-day trading on Wednesday as investors continued to process the Reserve Bank of India’s anticipated rate cut against the backdrop of escalating global trade tensions. The central bank lowered its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent and shifted its stance from “neutral” to “accommodative,” signalling a growth-focused approach. Equity markets decline as RBI cuts rates, shifts focus to growth amid global trade tensions, impacting IT and consumer goods. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a significant expansion of its co-lending framework, which was previously limited to arrangements between banks and NBFCs for priority sector loans only. The new policy will extend co-lending arrangements to all regulated entities and all loan categories. RBI expands co-lending framework to all regulated entities, aiming to boost credit access and drive inclusive growth.

The RBI’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing the repo rate to 6%, is more than just a monetary policy adjustment; it’s a calculated gamble on India’s ability to defy global headwinds through the sheer force of domestic demand. The central bank’s decision to revise FY26 GDP growth projections downward from 6.7% to 6.5% reflects realism, acknowledging that domestic demand alone may not be enough to offset external drags. Yet, with global trade fragmenting, export growth uncertain, and capital flows volatile, the economy has no choice except to double down on its most reliable engine: the Indian consumer. This isn’t just about lowering interest rates; it’s about reorienting the entire financial system to fuel consumption-led growth without leaving households and businesses drowning in debt. Financial institutions must move beyond passive rate transmission and actively shape lending toward high-impact sectors. Affordable housing, rural consumption, and small-business credit aren’t just growth drivers they’re lifelines for broader economic resilience. The focus should be on productive lending that boosts incomes, rather than merely spending. For instance, financing agri-tech startups that raise farm productivity puts more money in rural pockets, which then flows into FMCG, autos, and durables. Similarly, supporting MSMEs in tier-2 and tier-3 cities creates jobs that sustain urban consumption. This isn’t trickle-down economics; it’s a direct pipeline from credit to income to demand. But there’s a catch: inflation and currency risks loom large. A consumption surge that relies on imported goods such as electronics or energy could backfire by widening the trade deficit and pressuring the rupee. The solution lies in targeting credit at sectors that stimulate local production renewable energy, food processing, and manufacturing to keep demand leakage in check. Banks must also avoid the trap of reckless retail lending, where easy EMIs today become NPAs tomorrow. The path forward demands precision. Fiscal policy must complement monetary easing think tax cuts for middle-income earners, better supply chains to curb food inflation, and incentives for domestic manufacturing. If executed right, India’s consumption story won’t just offset global drags; it could redefine emerging-market resilience. But if mishandled, we risk repeating the boom-bust cycles of the past. The RBI has fired the starting gun. Now, lenders and policymakers must run the race with discipline. RBI policy – A rate cut as expected, stance change to “accommodation” – growth support all the way. RBI as expected announced a 25 bp rate cut announcement, the second rate cut after the first one in Feb’25, taking repo to 6%. Alongside the stance change to “Accommodation” from “Neutral”. Furthermore, there was a clear message from the governor that the change in stance signaled ‘status quo’ or ‘rate cut’. In addition, with the message that growth inflation trajectory demands monetary policy to be growth supportive – RBI’s path ahead is likely to followed by rate cuts. While lowering growth estimates by 20 bp for FY26 to 6.5%, and inflation estimates also by 20 bp to 4%, clearly there is more support for growth amidst global uncertainties. While acknowledging that the global outlook is clouded with tariff uncertainties, it appears that RBI is more inclined to support growth. Domestic inflation has downside from crude prices and positive drivers from food inflation. While there is risk from imported inflation from currency, inflation is not as much of a concern as much as growth. Overall, the trajectory, despite being guarded has tilted towards a growth-inflation balance from inflation-growth in the previous regime, with a clear emphasis on supporting growth. While there is unknown from tariffs, another unknown is always the weather. While governor acknowledged that tariff related uncertainties are very high, if India is able to manage with lesser dent on inflation, then we can expect more rate cuts down the line.

This is in line with our view of another 75-100 bps of rate cuts in FY2026E, implying repo rate at 5-5.25% by end-FY2026E. The benign outlook on inflation (favorable monsoon, lower crude oil prices to offset INR depreciation) and downside risks to growth will provide room for this deeper rate cut cycle. The RBI’s focus remains on addressing growth concerns as inflation is expected to remain around the 4% handle. We also expect the RBI to keep liquidity conditions ample to ensure smooth monetary policy transmission.” The shares of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited (GRSE) were trading at ₹1,524.85 down by ₹40.95 or 2.62 per cent on the NSE today at 11.25 am. RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. RBI delivered a 25bps rate cut, in line with market expectation. The policy stance has been changed to accommodative. The policy and stance continue to remain Growth supportive, as inflation is expected to remain benign. Both Inflation and GDP growth rates have been revised lower. We expect the monetary policy to support greater transmission to help Economic grow in the current uncertain global environment. We expect market rates to remain well supported with 10-yr continue to trade in 6.40%-6.60% range, with positive bias. Short-term yields upto 1 year are also likely to trade in the current range after a sharp rally of 75-100 bps over the last one month. Beyond domestic monetary policy, markets will take further cues from current Global Tariff Wars and its impact on macro-economic parameters and financial stability. “The RBI’s reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps is in line with market expectations and, coupled with the measures taken by them to infuse more liquidity, should signal good times for MSMEs. With much greater competition and global uncertainties, investment in up-to-date machinery is critical to maintaining our competitive edge. The cost of debt has been high in the past couple of years, and the signal towards a benign rate scenario should encourage MSMEs to plan capital investment.” “The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and adopt an accommodative stance is poised to positively impact the real estate sector. Lower interest rates are expected to enhance home loan affordability, which can significantly boost housing demand, especially in the affordable and mid-income categories. For developers, improved liquidity conditions may ease financing pressures, enabling faster execution and delivery of ongoing projects. The move also bodes well for commercial real estate, as lower borrowing costs could encourage business expansion and increase demand for office and retail spaces. While the GDP outlook has softened, the real estate market stands to benefit from the policy’s clear intent to support growth and investment. Overall, the industry is likely to witness renewed interest and improved sentiment, setting the stage for a more active and stable period ahead.” “A cut in the repo rate can be a strong catalyst for the real estate sector. Lower interest rates translate into more affordable home loans, encouraging first-time buyers and investors alike to explore bigger and premium homes. Mid-range and high-end segments will also benefit as buyers feel more confident making long-term commitments. At the same time, the change in stance to being ‘accommodative,’ supports steady decision-making for both developers and homebuyers, reigniting buyer sentiment and boosting overall housing demand. Additionally, with ongoing economic uncertainties in the US and other global markets, many NRIs are turning their attention to their home land . A repo rate cut is likely to further strengthen this trend, as more NRIs see real estate in India as a stable and attractive investment opportunity. This could lead to a significant uptick in NRI-driven investments across the Indian real estate sector.” RBI MPC: Keeping the guards ready ✓RBI’s unanimous 25bps rate cut and stance change to “accommodative” reflect the uncertain global environment and benign inflation environment; the change in stance provides a directional easing bias going forward. Given global volatility and uncertainty, the MPC chose not to frontload all its actions and thus kept its powder dry for rainier days. The fluid global dynamics will require RBI to be nimble in managing any risk of tighter financial conditions, especially as the shock to sentiment/capital flows will likely require higher risk premia from EMs. The RBI may want to keep ammunitions ready, given fluid global markets, apart from conventional easing. Options like (i) non-conventional easing in the form of easier regulatory (lending) norms, (ii) lower daily CRR maintainance requirement for banks to sub 90%, (ii) sterilised INR management, etc. may be used, if needed. ✓ One does not know the extent to which this global trade war could stretch. Monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India by being more counter-cyclical than fiscal this year. While June 25bps cut is a given, we no longer rule out another 25-50bp cut from there, which could take the terminal rate to 5.25% in this cycle – of course contingent on the extent of the global slowdown/recession ✓ While the 20bp growth downgrade by the RBI to 6.5% for FY26 reflects the uncertain global environment, we think there would be material downward risk to their growth forecast – to the tune of ~50-70bps. This would emanate from a much higher risk of a US/global recession if these global tariffs are maintained, while domestic private economic agents stay largely absent. ✓We reckon with the RBI that FY26 inflation would have a net disinflationary impulse (CPI revised down 20bps to 4%) which could emanate from lower global commodity prices/supply glut of goods. China’s survival response to massive tariff blow will matter for India, amid its excess industrial capacity and dumping in the world/Asia and use of FX as a policy tool. “MPC has delivered almost everything that was anticipated by the market. A 25 bps rate cut and change of policy stance to accommodative are welcome steps. FY 25 growth and inflation projection have been revised downwards by 20 bps to 6.5% and 4%, respectively. Dissipating food inflation, falling crude and uncertainty related to global growth environment seem to have led to this decision. On liquidity though, there is no fresh announcement but there is an assurance on liquidity provision as and when required.” The outcome of the RBI meeting was largely in line with expectations, with a unanimous decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6%. In a notable move, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also shifted its stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, signaling the possibility of further rate cuts in the coming months. Forecast revisions further reinforced this shift in priorities. GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downward from 6.7% to 6.5%, while inflation expectations have been eased from 4.2% to 4%. This suggests that the RBI is placing greater emphasis on supporting growth, particularly in the face of rising external risks such as global trade tensions, while remaining confident that inflation will stay within manageable levels. Overall, the message is clear: the RBI is now more focused on its growth mandate. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, we expect an additional 50–75 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, contingent on how the global trade situation evolves. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday it would issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms and conduct related aspects for gold loans, sending gold loan company stocks sharply lower. RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. The RBI’s 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate to 6% is a timely intervention. Change in stance to accommodative is sentimentally positive, allowing room for better liquidity and growth. Together, they will support both MSME and retail demand. The MSME sector which contributes nearly 30% to India’s GDP and accounts for over 40% of exports, will benefit from this move as it will ease credit costs and improve cash flows, which are critical for recovery and growth in the evolving market dynamics. We foresee improved credit appetite at Indian Bank as MSMEs form a vital part of our lending portfolio. Increasing scope of colending will further strengthen lending to these sectors. This cut is likely to spur demand for home, auto, and personal loans, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 markets, where interest sensitivity is higher. Retail loans grew over 18% YoY as per recent trends and a lower rate environment could further accelerate consumption and support economic momentum. Indian Bank is fully geared to pass on the benefits swiftly and responsibly to our customers, ensuring inclusive credit growth.

The growth-inflation outlook had also become supportive of a shift to an ‘accommodative’ policy stance at this meeting, as recent inflation prints have surprised to the downside, while growth risks have intensified amid rising economic uncertainty. The implementation of reciprocal tariffs by the US is expected to dampen global growth and weigh heavily on export-oriented sectors.

Overall, a supportive step for domestic growth with some caution on external pressures. “We welcome the Reserve Bank of India’s mature and forward-looking move to adopt an accommodative policy stance, underpinned by a balanced view on inflation and growth. The repo rate cut, coupled with the commitment to maintain adequate liquidity, reflects a timely and prudent response to evolving macroeconomic challenges. This stance is a positive step toward reinvigorating demand and catalyzing investments across sectors. For the NBFC sector, in particular, it signals a conducive environment to deepen credit access and drive inclusive growth. We believe the proposed policy revisions will stimulate the banking and financial services ecosystem in the right direction and support the broader goal of sustaining a healthy and resilient economy.” Signature Global (India) Limited announced its highest-ever annual pre-sales of ₹10,290 crore for fiscal year 2025, surpassing company guidance with 42 per cent year-on-year growth. “We welcome the RBI’s decision to lower the repo rate to 6.00%, a move that reinforces its balanced approach toward fostering growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. At a time when global uncertainties persist due to trade disruptions and geopolitical developments, this proactive stance signals confidence in the country’s inflation outlook. The anticipated moderation in CPI inflation creates room for monetary support, and this rate cut is well-positioned to boost consumer confidence and enhance credit accessibility. For the housing sector, particularly the mid-income and affordable segments, improved affordability is expected to drive demand and support broader economic momentum.” RBI cut repo rate by 25 basis points as widely expected. RBI changed its stance to accommodative from neutral, which was not on expected lines given the global background. RBI seems to be comfortable with currency depreciation in the coming months. RBI has reduced its GDP growth forecast to 6.5 from 6.7 percent and CPI inflation has been revised to 4 from 4.2 percent. They highlighted future expectation of CPI over a 3 and 6 month time frame is lower. The governor highlighted lower commodity prices specially oil prices due to tariff war and on the growth downside due to lower investments by companies. RBI made it clear they will provide liquidity in the banking system to support growth Rate cuts in India is expected to be deeper to support growth as CPI inflation is below target of 4 percent for most of the year as per RBI projections. The terminal rate on repo can go towards 5.25 levels from 6 percent at present. The ten-year yields can move towards 6 to 6.25 percent in the coming years as globally growth slows down. The RBI has delivered what the market expected – a 25-bps cut and a change in stance to “accommodative”. It was also explained that being “accommodative” means that there would be no chance of a rate hike at this point, even as the RBI stays vigilant with the evolving macro scenario of tariff wars and geopolitical risks. Both inflation and growth forecasts were lowered by 20 bps. There were no fresh liquidity measures that were announced in this policy. The space for policy rate cuts were predicated by a decisive change in the inflation outlook, led by food prices and more specifically vegetable prices. Given projections by the Skymet of a normal monsoon, the risks to food inflation is likely reduced. At the other end of the spectrum, global growth risks have unleashed a sharp softening in crude oil and other commodity prices, and this is also a positive for India’s inflation dynamics. Overall, the confidence that inflation would remain aligned to the 4% target has magnified. Given a 4% inflation target, the scope of pushing repo rate down to 5.50% in this cycle has opened. Consequently, we expect the RBI to cut in June and also in August. “The RBI’s 25 bps rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6%, along with a shift to an accommodative stance, reflects a proactive policy response to escalating global trade uncertainty and rising export headwinds — notably as India’s merchandise exports have been contracted since November 2024. With CPI inflation softening and crude oil prices easing, the external disinflationary environment has provided the RBI with policy space for calibrated easing. This move not only cushions domestic demand but also offers timely support to MSMEs and corporates facing tighter global conditions while macroeconomic stability remains well-anchored by $676 billion in forex reserves” “Housing demand has been robust in the last 4-5 years, driven by stable macros, strong consumer sentiment, income and wealth growth. However, an increase in capital values has started impacting sales across segments. A further rate cut of 25 bps with an accommodative stance announced today, post a 25-bps rate cut in February 2025, is likely to further improve affordability. The falling interest rate cycle is likely to sustain consumer sentiment to some extent which has started seeing signs of weakening amid the current global turmoil and uncertainty.” “RBI’s Monetary Policy outcome was in line with consensus estimates and a 25 bps rate cut should augur well both for the financial system and the economy. Given the ongoing tariff war across the world, an accommodative stance along with a stable inflationary scenario would ensure buoyant credit growth and support our domestic environment. The rate cut is indeed positive for our bond markets but the ongoing pressure on the US bond yield restricts the full extent of the impact in India.” “The policy announcements come against the backdrop of increased volatility across asset classes, fear of a sharp global slowdown due to tariff shock. We believe the policy announcements were balanced and prudent, especially given the current uncertainties. The change in stance highlights the MPC’s resolve to support growth, as inflation risks have come down while risks to growth have increased. On the liquidity front, we expect the RBI to remain proactive and ensure sufficient liquidity conditions in the banking system. Going forward, we believe that the global growth outlook is expected to be highly uncertain and may have potential negative implications for our growth. Inflation is expected to be within MPC’s target of 4% due to lower crude, food. We expect the RBI to continue to provide required support to growth through various measures.” RBI Cuts Rates, Turns Accommodative: Growth is the Focus The RBI’s April policy action—a widely anticipated 25 bps rate cut taking the repo to 6.00%, alongside a shift in stance to ‘accommodative’—reflects a calibrated but decisive pivot toward supporting domestic growth amid escalating global uncertainties. With CPI inflation revised down to 4.0% for FY26 from 4.2%, and Q1FY26 inflation expected at just 3.6%, the real policy rate has widened to 2.4% (actual) and ~2.0% (forward-looking). This is materially above the RBI’s internal neutral real rate estimate of 1.4–1.9%, clearly indicating monetary space to ease further. Growth-wise, the RBI’s revision of FY26 GDP to 6.5% (from 6.7%) appears cautious, especially given strong underlying domestic fundamentals. Improving rural demand, resilient services exports, uptick in urban discretionary consumption, and accelerating investment momentum—driven by healthy corporate balance sheets and sustained public capex. Indeed, India remains an outlier in a decelerating global landscape, where tariff-induced frictions, manufacturing softness, and higher-for-longer rates are dragging global trade and investment activity. Inflation, on the other hand, is not just moderating—it is durably anchored. Headline CPI has averaged ~3.8% in Q4FY25, with vegetable prices registering a sequential decline for four consecutive months. NHB data points to a further 2% m-o-m decline in March, strengthening the disinflation narrative. A normal monsoon scenario could keep FY26 inflation in the 4% range, particularly given benign global commodity and crude trends (Brent below $70/bbl). Add to this China’s excess industrial capacity and weak global demand—both feeding into regional disinflation—and the inflation-growth mix for India is now the most conducive in years. On the liquidity front, RBI has managed a structural transition efficiently. After an average LAF deficit of ₹1.65 tn in Q4FY25, the system moved into surplus by March-end. Planned OMO purchases of ₹800 bn (₹200 bn each tranche) and an expected RBI dividend transfer of ₹2.5–3 tn in Q1FY26 will ensure that liquidity conditions remain conducive for rate transmission. With 60%+ of bank loans benchmarked to EBLR, policy transmission is more responsive than in prior cycles—50–75 bps of additional rate cuts could translate to 25–30 bps of GDP impulse via lower borrowing costs. Globally, policy uncertainty remains high. The U.S. tariff hikes (equivalent to a ~20% increase in average import duty) represent the steepest protectionist move in over a century. While India’s direct exposure remains modest—non-pharma exports to the U.S. are just ~1.4% of GDP—the broader impact of weaker global demand, tighter financial conditions, and deflated business confidence cannot be ignored. Yet, the lack of systemic financial stress, continued resilience in services exports and remittances, and a manageable current account trajectory (well below 2.0% of GDP) offer India insulation. In this context, the RBI has struck a prudent balance—neither flinching from external risks nor front-loading rate cuts aggressively. The shift to an accommodative stance, while decoupled from liquidity operations, signals policy optionality in favour of growth. We anticipate a cumulative 75–100 bps of further easing in 2025, contingent on monsoon outcomes, evolving global financial conditions, and inflation pass-through risks. The policy’s core message is subtle but strong: inflation containment is no longer the constraint; sustaining growth momentum without fuelling imbalances is now the monetary priority. The RBI has chosen to lead with calm conviction rather than reactive intervention—anchoring expectations while keeping its powder dry in an uncertain world. “The RBI’s move to cut the repo rate to 6 per cent and adopt an accommodative stance is a timely and growth-supportive measure. This decision is expected to inject greater liquidity into the market and bring down borrowing costs, thereby improving sentiment across the real estate sector. Amid global headwinds, including the recent U.S. tariffs of 26 per cent on Indian exports and a slower GDP growth rate of 6.5 per cent, this rate cut signals the central bank’s proactive approach to sustaining economic drive. With enhanced access to capital and improved investor confidence, the industry is poised to witness increased momentum in both residential and commercial segments. The move also reinforces trust in the RBI’s commitment to long-term financial stability, making this an opportune moment for buyers and investors to act with optimism.” Trade war escalates as US imposes 104% tariffs on Chinese imports •\u0009The US has put a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, raising tensions between the world’s two largest economies and causing market volatility. The White House acknowledged that the new tariff structure, which takes effect on April 9, follows President Donald Trump’s ultimatum to Beijing to reverse its retaliatory 34% taxes on American imports. •\u0009This adds to concerns that an all-out trade war could force the global economy into a recession, triggering a new wave of risk-aversion trading and reviving demand for the safe-haven gold price. •\u0009Investors increased their bets that a tariff-induced US economic slowdown would prompt the Federal Reserve to resume its rate-cutting cycle shortly. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicates that traders are pricing in a more than 60% possibility that the Fed will decrease borrowing costs in May. Furthermore, the US central bank is predicted to provide five rate cuts by 2025. Technical Triggers\u0009 •\u0009The gold active June contract has significant support at $3000 (~Rs 87000). However, if prices remain below $3000, they may fall below $2900 (~Rs 84500). •\u0009Silver has excellent support at $29 (about Rs 87000). I do not believe Silver can remain below this level. Every decline below $30 (~Rs 89000) should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of $32 (~Rs 94000). “Undertaking a second successive step to ease policy, the Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously in favour of a 25bp rate cut. In line with our view, the stance was revised to ‘accommodative’, reflecting policymakers’ comfort with the evolving inflation trajectory and providing room to support growth. This was reinforced by the modest downward revision in growth projections. Recent liquidity management measures have underscored the preference to maintain a surplus balance, thereby keeping the banking system well-oiled and aiding policy transmission. Overall, policy guidance remained dovish, while keeping an eye on global uncertainties and the consequent need to maintain stability in domestic financial markets. We expect a further 50bp of cuts this year.” Copper futures has seen a sharp drop in price recently. The continuous contract, after hitting a high of ₹922.20 on March 26, declined in the following sessions and closed at ₹797.85 on April 8, losing about 13 per cent. Copper futures experience sharp drop, with support at ₹790 and resistance at ₹825, traders advised to stay out. “The decision by RBI to reduce the repo rate to 6% is a welcome move as it aligns with broader goal of fostering economic growth. Pertaining to gold industry, the anticipated lower interest rates should further drive investor interest towards safe-heaven assets like gold, resulting into increasing momentum in the sector. We expect this to bolster the demand for gold. We believe that the monetary easing will encourage consumers and investors to consider gold as a safe bet amidst all the ongoing global uncertainties. With an approach to control inflation and borrowing costs reduced as well, we predict increased consumer spending power that will eventually benefit the gold industry.” The RBI has proven yet again that it is an ahead-of-the-curve central bank. The RBI has not only cut rates to support growth amid global turmoil, but also swiftly changed its stance from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Accommodative’. The policy change indicates the RBI is in a good position to cut rates if needed going forward. The RBI indicating that the inflation is benign, and the economic growth will be non-inflationary going forward, was one of the highlights of the policy. The RBI has done its part and delivered the much-needed relief to the industry on time. The government should make efforts to engage with the US government to find a solution to the trade tariff issue. The Indian economy remains strong, with key risks of a global slowdown due to trade tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and protectionism. “The RBI MPC meeting led by governor Sanjay Malhotra has announced a repo rate reduction of 25 basis points to a 6% cut .The rate has remained unchanged since February 2023. The rate cut will benefit homebuyers, since there will be a reduction in interest rates on home loans, leading to affordability. Loan EMIs will also reduce, which will be beneficial to refinance existing home loans.” Gold prices inched higher in the early Asian trade rebounding form a three-week low as investors sought safety amidst escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose to a one-week high reversing from recent low of ~4%, while dollar index stayed firm hovering around 103. In the previous session, rupee also depreciated sharply by ~40 paise supporting domestic prices. Concerns over a global trade war since U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on April 2 have raised fears of a slowdown and prompted investors to take refuge in the safe-haven assets like gold. In fresh updates regarding tariff war, President Trump to proceed with extra 50% tariff on China as trade war escalates. The tariffs will be especially steep for China, as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up duties on Chinese imports to 104% to counter Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to “fight to the end”. Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds registered largest quarterly inflow in three years in January-March 2025, data from the World Gold Council showed. Market participants will now keep an eye on RBI policy meeting and FOMC meeting minutes. Focus this week will be on US CPI and PPI data. A 25 basis points rate cut by RBI is a welcome and timely move. It has reinforced the central bank’s commitment to support economic growth, especially at a time when inflation appears to be within manageable limits. A lower interest rate environment has always provided relief to businesses and consumers alike, potentially spurring credit demand, investments, and job creation. Rate cuts amidst tariff turmoil also signals that RBI sees enough macroeconomic stability to continue with an accommodative stance. However, we must ensure that this liquidity gets translated into tangible gains for sectors that need it most, particularly MSMEs, housing, and infrastructure. Economy should realize the full benefits of lower rates through policy support and sustained reform The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced its key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% during its April policy meeting, marking the second consecutive rate cut. This move, in line with market expectations, lowers borrowing costs to the lowest level since November 2022, amid easing inflation and slowing economic growth. The RBI revised its GDP growth forecast for FY2025-26 to 6.5%, down from 6.7%. The inflation projection was also lowered to 4% from 4.2%, remaining within the target range of 2-6%. Growth projections for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are 6.5%, 6.7%, 6.6%, and 6.3%, respectively, while inflation is forecasted at 3.6% in Q1, rising to 4.4% by Q4. With global uncertainties, this rate cut may support economic growth. The USD/INR pair is expected to trade between 86.00 and 86.90 next week, shortened by holidays. “The RBI’s decision to cut rates by another 25bps was largely on expected lines. It also changed its stance from neutral to accommodating. This paves the way for further rate cuts in the upcoming meetings. With inflation cooling off, the regulator has revised its inflation forecast for FY26 downwards to 4% vs 4.2% earlier. However, amidst global challenges, the GDP growth rate has also been tweaked downwards to 6.5% compared to 6.7% earlier. During the rate easing cycle, a general trend emerges: improved CASA ratios for banks. This has not been the case in Q4, with deposit growth being led by both CASA and TDs based on the provisional updates released by banks thus far. Systemic liquidity has been in deficit for the more significant part of the quarter, though it eased into surplus as banks exit Q4FY25. We expect the transmission on the CoF side to be slower vs the pace of transmission on the yields. Regarding margins for banks, we expect the full impact of the rate cut to reflect from Q1FY26, with a partial impact visible in Q4. We believe NBFCs like Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance, SBI Cards and Cholamandalam Inv. & Fin. would benefit not only from the rate cuts but also from the RBI’s decision to roll back the higher risk weight on bank loans to NBFCs. Amongst banks, we prefer large private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank and ICICI Bank”. “The awaited RBI MPC meeting announcement has arrived. The committee has announced a 25 basis point reduction to 6% from 6.25%. For homebuyers, it is a positive news, making it a lenient approach on the part of the committee. The reduction will make home loans and EMIs affordable. Homebuyers can also go for floating rate loans for more affordable housing.” Sandeep Bagla, CEO, TRUST Mutual Fund on RBI MPC: “RBI MPC cut repo rate by 25 bps, which was as per expected lines. It also changed its stance to neutral, which denoted that RBI is now unequivocal in its support of domestic growth and confident that inflation will move towards its desired rate of 4%. I expect the curve to steepen with the shorter end of the curve benefitting more. In the US, the tariff induced inflation fears are rising, which will lead to rising long bond yields. High global yields will influence the longer end bond yields in India as well.

With inflation pressures abating in the last several months and a repo rate already lowered to 6.25% in the previous meeting, the committee again must address a long-standing question of how to support growth while not permitting inflation pressures to run up again. The backdrop globally is still tense, as fears of trade wars and a potential global slowdown are pressing nerves. While there can be another small rate cut coming through, the views of the MPC would prefer an interim pause in order to allow time and space to properly evaluate the current backdrop. Attention may shift more towards financial stability measures and ensuring there is enough liquidity in the system. I feel the RBI will remain cautious, assessing how both global and domestic conditions play out before looking to intervene again.

Gold prices surged back above the $3,000 mark on Wednesday as mounting global trade tensions and rising recession fears drove investors toward safe-haven assets. The move comes amid escalating US-China tariff threats, with the White House confirming a 104% tariff on Chinese imports effective today. Markets are also pricing in multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, weighing on the US Dollar and supporting gold. However, rising US Treasury yields—fueled by speculation that China is dumping bonds in retaliation—could limit gains. Traders now await FOMC minutes and US inflation data later this week for fresh cues on the Fed’s rate path. The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its stance to ‘accommodative’ reflects growing confidence in the disinflationary trend and a clear pivot toward supporting growth. The recent drop in CPI inflation to 3.62% in February well below the RBI’s mid-point target of 4% provides ample room for easing. While wholesale inflation inched up slightly to 2.38%, it remains within a manageable range, reinforcing the view that inflationary pressures are abating. This policy shift is likely to lower borrowing costs, boost liquidity, and support domestic demand—especially as fiscal measures and improving rural prospects kick in InCred Alternatives announced the ﬁnal close of its maiden private equity fund - InCred Growth Partners Fund-I. The fund has secured capital commitments in excess of ₹575 crore, well above its target size of ₹500 crore (after exercising the greenshoe option), with support from large family oﬃces, UHNI and HNI investors Given the changing world order, with significant tariff imposition by the US, global growth is likely to be impacted, which may have an impact on Indian growth also. RBI has moderated its GDP growth projection for FY2025-26 by 20 bps to 6.50%, similarly moderated its headline inflation projection to 4.00% (vs previously 4.20%). Keeping this growth-inflation dynamic in mind, Monetary Policy Committee (MCPC) of RBI has decided to further cut the repo rate by 25 bps to 6% and change the stance to accommodative from neutral, indicating RBI will support the growth in this global uncertain times. We expect further 50 bps rate cut in next six months by RBI. Eternal Ltd, formerly known as Zomato Ltd, saw its shares decline by 1.84 per cent in early trading today, with the stock priced at ₹211.30 on BSE and ₹211.22 on NSE as of 10:25 am. The RBI’s 25 basis points repo rate cut to 6.00%, coupled with a unanimous shift in stance to “accommodative,” signals a decisive pivot towards growth. With inflation expectations anchored FY26 CPI forecast now revised lower to 4% the central bank has found room to support demand without risking macro stability. Governor Sanjay Malhotra’s tone struck a balance: confident on domestic resilience, yet cautious of global headwinds. The US tariff escalations, weaker dollar, and volatile crude prices pose potential risks to India’s exports and imported inflation. Yet, the RBI believes the domestic economy is well-positioned to weather these shocks. GDP growth for FY26 is projected at 6.5%, with strong traction in agriculture, a revival in manufacturing, and healthy urban consumption. System liquidity has turned surplus in April crossing ₹1.5 lakh crore offering further tailwind to credit growth. This rate cut will likely translate into lower EMIs, spur home loan demand, and eventually stimulate private capex. Structural reforms continue in parallel, with gold loan norms and expanded co-lending frameworks aimed at improving credit delivery and financial stability. Despite some moderation in net FDI due to repatriation, India’s long-term story remains intact reflected in sustained capital inflows and a robust banking sector. In short, the RBI has signaled its intent: revive growth while keeping inflation in check. For equity markets and investors, this marks the start of a more supportive monetary cycle, aligning well with India’s long-term structural growth trajectory.

Title: Panama launches probe into CK Hutchison’s 25-year port deal

Gomez made the announcement after Panama's comptroller general criticized the contract, renewed in 2021, earlier this week. Comptroller Anel Flores said Panama "left $1.3 billion on the table," referring to tax incentives and benefits granted by the government to CK Hutchison. Trump says US will take back Panama Canal "This prosecutor's office is conducting an investigation initiated 'ex officio' for the alleged commission of a crime against public administration and other crimes against the State," Gomez said in a letter sent to Flores on Tuesday. The 25-year contract awarded to Panama Ports Company, in which CK Hutchison has a 90% stake, for the concession of the Balboa and Cristobal ports has been under audit since January. The audit is nearing completion, Flores said on Monday, adding that a lawsuit would be filed against government officials who authorized the contract. Since February, Panama's Supreme Court has also discussed the concession. BlackRock’s $23-billion deal to strengthen US control over Panama Canal Ports, global trade sees rising American presence in other strategic assets The contract reviews are seen as possible roadblocks in a key $22.8 billion deal announced in March by a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock to get access to CK Hutchison's port business in 23 countries, including the two ports in Panama. CK Hutchison and BlackRock did not immediately reply to requests for comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, speaking earlier this week at a conference in New York, said the deal was not made for geopolitical reasons, but the company was aware that China would review it as much as other jurisdictions. Regulatory review of the deal could take nine more months, Fink said, adding he was optimistic it would be approved. China's embassy in Panama said on Tuesday in a social media post that it has and will continue respecting Panama's sovereignty, and added that the relationship between the U.S. and Panama should not be "excluding." If irregularities in the concession renewal are confirmed by Panama's government or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, lawyers and experts have said.

New Delhi: India is mapping a course to become a shipbuilding powerhouse, forging strategic joint ventures between its state-owned enterprises and maritime giants from South Korea and Japan. State-run enterprises are engaging companies including Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanwha of South Korea and Mitsui of Japan, two people aware of the plans said, in an ambitious bid to secure a larger share of the global demand and reduce India's reliance on overstretched Asian shipyards. State-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL) may join hands with Hyundai Heavy Industries for a new facility in Kochi, the people said on the condition of anonymity. Cochin Shipyard confirmed the talks, but did not identify the future partner. A Hyundai team had visited India early this year for a preliminary survey for investing in Indian shipbuilding. “We are close to signing a deal with an overseas shipbuilder from Korea or Japan that would be making hulls for large ships," said Madhu S. Nair, chairman and managing director, Cochin Shipyard. "We already have a large 310 m dry dock that can also be used by the new joint venture for making ships of different sizes up to 300 m in length. A foreign partnership will help in bringing technology and scale required for making large ship hulls using tonnes of steel. The new facility should roll out ships in double-digits to meet both domestic and overseas demand," Nair added. New facilityLand for the new facility will be provided by the government-owned Cochin Port Trust, close to Cochin Shipyard's existing facility in Kochi, one of the two people said. The new facility will build cargo ships, container vessels, tankers, dry bulk cargo ships and multi-purpose vessels. It would, however, not make very large crude carriers (VLCCs) due to infrastructural shortcomings, but may consider it later depending on market conditions.

The company may consider a shipbuilding facility planned near Gujarat's Kandla Port, a Union government-owned port with ample land and basic infrastructure for shipbuilding and repairs. Also, a team from Japanese ship maker Mitsui OSK Shipping is expected in India around June, the people said. Among the main tasks for the group would be to seek local partnerships. “The first deal for a large shipbuilding facility may be reached in the next couple of months, with a few other deals expected before the end of the current year. Ship manufacturing in India will help the country become a major hub for ships after Korea, Japan and China," said the second person.

Mint had reported in September that India is looking for investments from Korea and Japan for its shipbuilding ambitions. Shipping boostIndia is not alone in trying to breathe life into its shipbuilding industry. In February, US President Donald Trump slapped fees of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built ships entering the US, with charges of up to $1 million on both fleets that have ordered new Chinese ships and non-Chinese vessels in fleets with Chinese ships. The move aims to rebuild American shipyards. The global shipbuilding industry is currently dominated by massive shipyards in China, South Korea and Japan; however, these facilities are overbooked, with waiting periods running from three to five years. “Investments and technology transfers from countries like South Korea and Japan are being sought by the Indian government," said Pushpank Kaushik, CEO of Jassper Shipping, a Hyderabad-based shipping and logistics company. "Support has been expressed by states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Odisha for setting up maritime clusters. A detailed briefing on advanced and eco-friendly shipbuilding was also received from South Korea. Large commercial shipbuilding in India remains limited, even though 28 shipyards exist. Most ship repairs are handled overseas. However, with foreign support and partnerships, domestic capabilities are expected to improve, and larger ships may be constructed," Kaushik added. Global hubIndia is trying to become a global hub for ships, and push up local ship ownership by scaling Indian-built and Indian-owned and flagged cargo ships. The country’s share in global shipbuilding remains below 1%. The government’s projection is raise the share of Indian built ships in India’s fleet from 5% at present to 7% by 2030 and 69% by 2047 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. The plan is to set four mega shipbuilding parks, two each on the east and west coasts. Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal has said that two shipbuilding parks would be made operational by 2030, eyeing a share of the $100 billion global shipbuilding market. Also read | How charging Chinese ships could ripple through the economy Cochin Shipyard's Nair said that while the investment details and the nature of equity partnership of its new venture are being worked out, such a facility would require investments in thousands of crores of rupees and create employment for over 2,000 people. A modern shipbuilding facility typically costs $5-6 billion for construction, port infrastructure and ancillary services. Since a dry dock facility is already available in Kochi, the new facility may require less. In July last year, Mint reported that to create a market for domestic shipbuilding, the shipping ministry has proposed a joint venture of the state-run Shipping Corp. of India (SCI) with public sector oil marketing companies to build VLCCs. This venture may also rope in a foreign technology partner. Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal told Mint in September that the government has launched a mega ship-building mission to develop mega shipbuilding parks along both coasts, and ministerial teams had visited South Korea and Japan to seek their investment in parks, and at least three state governments have agreed to provide land. Maritime fundEarlier this year, the FY26 budget proposed a ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund, a government-industry partnership to help develop manufacturing clusters with a focus on shipbuilding and breaking. The budget also proposed revamping the existing Shipbuilding Financial Assistance (SBF) policy to address cost disadvantages, while also providing credit notes for shipbreaking to help purchase indigenously-built ships. The budget also included large ships in the infrastructure harmonized master list (HML) allowing purchase of ships on easier terms while providing basic customs duty exemption on raw materials, components, consumables or parts for the manufacture of ships extended for another 10 years.

The shipbuilding initiative would also address a concern of the trade about the uncertainty and variability (escalation) of shipping cost impacting their market competitiveness. With better availability of domestic shipping lines at affordable prices, the freight rate volatility due to Black Swan events like the covid pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Red Sea crisis could also be checked.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/08/2025 4:22:03 PM PDT by george76 Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock Inc., warned policymakers in New York City on Monday that crime, cleanliness and a shortage of quality schools have significantly undermined the city’s attractiveness to businesses. “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies,” the 72-year-old Fink said during a candid conversation hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” ... Fink, who first arrived in New York during the rough-and-tumble 1970s when it was plagued by an economic crisis and widespread urban decay, expressed deep frustration, saying: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” His investment firm, BlackRock, oversees assets totaling approximately $11.6 trillion and is headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards .... Since late 2019, approximately 160 Wall Street firms, collectively managing nearly $1 trillion in assets, have moved their headquarters out of New York. ... The city has seen a significant reduction in drugstores, losing nearly 40% over the past decade, with 10% of closures occurring in 2024 alone. Major chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid have reduced their presence, citing factors such as rampant shoplifting and other crimes. ... Major felony crimes have increased by 32.0%, including serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, and auto theft. Petty thefts at drugstores have increased by 37.4%, while quality-of-life offenses resulting in summonses, including public drinking and urination, have jumped by 37.7% (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo By Michael McDonald (Bloomberg) — Panama’s top auditor accused port operator CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. of wrongdoing, providing a potential pathway for the Central American country to wrest control of canal facilities caught up in a diplomatic tug-of-war between the US and China. Panama Ports Co., part of Hong Kong-based Hutchison’s far-flung operations, failed to obtain required approvals for a contract extension in 2021, and owed millions in dues, Comptroller General Anel Flores told reporters Monday following an audit. Flores plans to file a criminal complaint with Panama’s attorney general’s office on Tuesday against the maritime authorities who granted the 2021 contract renewal and against executives of Panama Ports, he said. Ultimately, Panama’s Maritime Authority will need to decide whether to rescind the contract, he said. CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The move ratchets up pressure on CK Hutchison, founded by Li Ka-Shing, to give up control of two Panama Canal ports, after US President Donald Trump began pushing to rid the canal of Chinese influence. The audit was launched shortly after Trump returned to office in January; Hutchison then agreed to sell operations including the two facilities to a BlackRock Inc.-led consortium. But Chinese authorities have put pressure on the conglomerate to scuttle the BlackRock deal, which would net Hutchison more than $19 billion in cash should the transaction go through. Before the audit results were announced, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he anticipates nine months of regulatory review, including from China, before a final decision is made on the deal. “I’m actually pretty optimistic that we will find a solution because, if you look at it, everything was done in the right order,” Fink said in an interview Monday at the Economic Club of New York. “I think it’s going to be a very interesting thing to watch for geopolitical purposes.” The audit’s outcome makes it clear that Panama’s government, which has close ties to the US, can attempt to remove Hutchison even if the BlackRock deal doesn’t go through. Flores said that in addition to the lapses in required approvals, his audit found that Panama Ports used a series of tax-exempt subcontractors to lower the amount it pays to the government. The company used tax breaks to save $850 million of at least $1.3 billion it owed in payments to the republic in the first 25 years of the contract period, Flores said, adding that it currently owes $300 million. The company also breached its agreement to share 10% of net income with Panama’s government, Flores said. “There are two people in a transaction, but they need to know what they are selling and that what they are buying might not be what they were told,” Flores said, referring to the BlackRock deal. “There are breaches, nonpayments and countless things that were wrongly calculated.” The Balboa and Cristobal ports on either side of the 51-mile (82-kilometer) Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, form a key part of the deal involving a total of 43 CK Hutchison facilities. While CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own borders, currency and legal system, Beijing has tightened its grip on the former British colony since 2020 when it imposed a broad national security law that’s paved the way for a crackdown on dissent. A consortium backed by BlackRock agreed last month to buy a majority of Panama Ports and other Hutchison assets. But the parties are yet to sign the deal while it’s being scrutinized by Chinese authorities. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: What’s Open Interest?

Time Published: 2025-04-08T22:29:13Z
Full Content:
Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—such as options or futures—that have not been settled. It’s a measure of market activity and liquidity. In this chart, the metric is Open Interest / Market Cap, which shows how much derivatives trading (through open interest) exists relative to the total size (market cap) of the asset or company. Here’s what this means in practice: • SPY at 180.1%: The open interest in SPY options is 180.1% of SPY’s market cap. That signals extremely high speculative or hedging activity. • MSTR at 78.2%: MicroStrategy has a high level of speculative interest relative to its market size—likely due to its Bitcoin exposure. • AAPL at 3.2%: Apple has a much lower level of open interest compared to its market cap, which suggests less leverage/speculation relative to its massive size. Why it matters: • High open interest ratios can suggest heavy speculative positioning or hedging. • Low ratios might indicate a more passive investor base or less speculative attention. Would you like a deeper breakdown on how to interpret this in trading or investing terms? .

Title: U.S. to take back Panama Canal from Chinese influence, visiting Pentagon chief says

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama's government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama's forces and said China would not be allowed to "weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships for espionage. "Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. "China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations." More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world's second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth got a close-up look at the Panama Canal on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump's threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth's visit. "On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama," said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama's formal move to exit China's Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump's crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country's dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump's southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. U.S. SECURITY CONCERNS Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming" the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration's assertion that China's presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. "What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been," Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama's administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it "is, and will continue to be, Panamanian."

The last thing the US needs is rapist liar threatening somebody with empty threat The US has no merchant ships and Panama controls the canal, not China. The last thing the US needs is rapist liar threatening somebody with empty threat Doesn't matter, the Panama Canal is vital to US National Security interests and should have never been in the hands of the Chinese, now reverse it, you think on your life the Chinese would ALLOW the US to hold it if it were the gateway into their country or violating their territorial sovereignty? They won't even allow you to open up businesses and invest in property or land in their country, but we have to? Not your country, not your canal.. Get your dirty hands off Panama !!. Doesn't matter, the Panama Canal is vital to US National Security interests and should have never been in the hands of the Chinese, now reverse it, you think on your life the Chinese would ALLOW the US to hold it if it were the gateway into their country or violating their territorial sovereignty? They won't even allow you to open up businesses and invest in property or land in their country, but we have to? It is not US territory. The US has no legitimate claim to that canal any more. Period. Full stop. It is the territory of a sovereign nation. What you and many like you can't seem to get through your testadura is that Panama owns the canal. Panama, not China. A Chinese company operates two container ports on either end of the canal. That company gained those leases in 1997 when the canal was still operated by the US. The US granted Hutchison the long term leases on those two container ports, not Panama. Even still, they are leases for container ports. They are separate from the canal. The right is telling lie after lie on this matter trying to drum up a reason to go to war over the canal. And people like you who claim to be ardent to end wars and stop the fighting in Ukraine flip and cheer lead the US to seize the Panama Canal. Max hypocrisy. It is not US territory. The US has no legitimate claim to that canal any more. Period. Full stop. It is the territory of a sovereign nation. We do have a claim Treaty with Panama (1903 – Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) After helping Panama gain independence from Colombia in 1903, the U.S. signed a treaty with the newly formed Panamanian government. The treaty gave the U.S.: *Control of the Panama Canal Zone** (a 10-mile-wide strip of land)* The right to build, operate, and protect the canal “in perpetuity” In exchange, Panama got a payment and an annual lease fee *This treaty is what gave the U.S. a legal claim to build and run the canal.* I think the lawyers and constitutionalists know more than you, I'll give them the props for pushing this legally. Treaty with Panama (1903 – Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) ROFL Trump is not interested in international treaties that the US is signature to so why this one? It is dead in the water. "The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which granted the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone, no longer applies as it was superseded by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1977, which led to the full transfer of control of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999. " Fixed for you. I blame the lower education standard of summer schools. Like the Trump University ask for your money back. Trump is not interested in international treaties that the US is signature to so why this one? It is dead in the water. Yeah, he won't win the Presidency, he won't get the Senate, he will lose the House and he won't get to send illegals back. DOGE won't be able to continue and get access to sensitive info. you guys need to stop saying things you guys fully no well will not come through for you, This is another one, not even remotely close to being dead in the water, it's just getting started. "The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which granted the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone, no longer applies as it was superseded by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1977, which led to the full transfer of control of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999. " Fixed for you. Really? The U.S. had a legal right to build and operate the Panama Canal based on a 1903 treaty, but that claim became controversial due to how the treaty was made, even though it was returned to Panama, so again LEGAL RIGHT, makes all the difference in the world I blame the lower education standard of summer schools.

search 6,500 sf house has 100 ft of waterfront, hit market for $17M in July SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE Kenneth Grunley, CEO of Grunley Construction, bought a waterfront home in Jupiter’s gated Admirals Cove community for $15.3 million. Records show Grunley bought the house at 112 Quayside Drive from Russell and Patricia Stern. Michele and Fredrick Locke with Fine Living Realty of the Palm Beaches had the listing, and Janis Lax with Waterfront Properties & Club Communities brought the buyer. Grunley heads his namesake Rockville, Maryland-based construction firm. It is one of the largest general contractors in the Washington, D.C. area, and specializes in government, commercial and institutional buildings. Grunley has performed renovation and modernization work on some of D.C.’s most iconic structures: the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the Washington Monument, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Watergate Hotel, to name a few. Russell Stern heads The Alternative Board (TAB) Jupiter, a business coaching firm. He was previously CEO of Solarflare Communications, a semiconductor developer that Santa Clara-based AMD (formerly Xilinx) bought for $400 million in 2019, according to published reports. The Sterns bought the 0.4-acre waterfront Admirals Cove property for $2.2 million in 2019, according to property records. The home was built in 2021, and spans 6,500 square feet with five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and 100 feet of waterfront with a dock, records and the listing show. It hit the market in July for $17 million, according to Zillow. Admirals Cove is a gated luxury community that has attracted high-profile buyers over the years. Donald Trump Jr. and his now ex-fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle bought a $9.7 million mansion in 2021. Blue Jays pitcher Max Scherzer owns two homes in the community; he spent a combined $24.7 million acquiring them. Last year, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder sold his Admirals Cove mansion for $14 million. In November, seed magnate Ronald Holden sold his 1.1-acre estate for $34 million, then a record price for Jupiter. Edward Brown, retired CEO of Patrón Spirits, sold his Bears Club mansion for $48 million in February, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Jupiter and inland Palm Beach County.

Title: "We Will Take Back Panama Canal...": Pentagon Chief Meets Panama President

Time Published: 2025-04-08T20:29:36Z
Full Content:
The US will take back the Panama Canal, ending China's influence in one of the world's most important waterways, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said today after a rare visit to the Central American nation. Marking the first visit by a US defence secretary to Panama in decades, Mr Hegseth held a closed-door meeting with Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. He also got a close-up look of the canal as Washington reiterated its deep concern over China's investments and involvement in and around the crucial waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Following talks with Panama's government, the Pentagon chief vowed to deepen the US military's security cooperation with Panamanian forces. China, he said, would "not be allowed to weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships as a guise for espionage. "Together, we (Panama and the US) will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Secretary Hegseth said in Panama City. Given Donald Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes were high for Secretary Hegseth's visit. The new arrangement with Panama, a first since 1999, will effectively end China's influence in the Panama Canal, he suggested. "China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations," he said. The Pentagon chief also praised President Mulino, saying his government understood "the threat from China". His remarks about Panama being in the "lead" on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. While Secretary Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence from Panama, President Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Even before Mr Hegseth reached Panama, the Trump Administration had reportedly requested options from the US military to ensure access to the Panama Canal. The United States had built the Panama Canal more than a century ago and handed its complete operations over to Panama in 1999. Today's development changes that dynamic with the US military likely to start patrolling and accessing the canal frequently, and in coordination with Panama's security agencies. According to news agency Reuters, several current and former US officials and strategic experts say that the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. In February, President Mulino had announced Panama's formal move to exit China's Belt and Road Initiative. He has also aided Donald Trump's crackdown on migrants in the United States. He did so by accepting US' deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to curb migration from South America by those crossing illegally through his country's dangerous Darien jungle. In a significant move last month, US firm BlackRock led a deal to buy out most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. At the time President Trump celebrated the deal, saying that the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming the Panama Canal". China however, had slammed the deal. The markets regulator has said that it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Military experts have pointed out that in the event of a war in Asia, the Panama Canal plays a critical role as US naval ships cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support war efforts. With China's vast presence in and around the canal, it could hinder the passage of ships, they said, adding that even if Beijing would not be able to stop American naval vessels in such a scenario, it would be in an advantageous position by being able to surveil vessels passing through it.

April 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Fourth Quarter Revenues Increase 25.7% to $33.6 Million at 27.0% Gross Margin Profile Completion of Strategic CapEx Projects and New Senior Hires Driving Robust Revenue and Margin Growth EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary “The fourth quarter of 2025 was highlighted by a robust 25.7% revenue growth, to a record $33.6 million, and the highest quarterly gross margin for the fiscal year at 27.0%, with the completion of CapEx investments to double our grilled chicken throughput, positioning us for the next leg up in growth, as reflected in the market share gains we saw this quarter,” said Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations. “Construction-related disruptions at our Farmingdale facility that had been impacting gross margins were firmly behind us in September, putting us back on track toward our near-term target in the high 20% range. While commodities and tariffs continue to put pressure on the macroeconomic environment, we have positioned ourselves well in anticipation of potential future macro headwinds. With over half of our expected protein needs for the new fiscal year locked in via fixed-price agreements, we are better prepared than ever to weather any macro headwinds. “Emphasis on our 4 Cs – Cost, Controls, Culture and Catapult – during the quarter was supported by continued automation and operational efficiency improvements across the organization. This included the aforementioned CapEx investments that were completed in September, as well as labor cost savings through a new lower overtime staffing model that was fully implemented in January, and additional procurement efficiencies and recent upgrades to our existing grills that will drive meaningful improvements in throughput. We continue to focus on selling new products that leverage the entire chicken breast, which allows us to trim more often, creating a cycle of higher gross margins through significant cost savings. By mid-year, we expect to trim most of our chicken in-house, from a small minority today. “Taken together, we believe we now have the world-class operational asset base and team in place to fully optimize operations, execute on our Catapult growth plan and identify, acquire and integrate future M&A opportunities. With these strong fundamentals, we believe we are well-positioned to emerge as a dominant player and a consolidator in the prepared foods space. Our marketing has grown to capture new customers, cohorts and occasions, and our team is selling with confidence and fulfilling pent-up demand. This has driven the robust 19.4% growth we saw in fiscal 2025, nearly double last year’s growth, all while building the foundation for an even stronger fiscal 2026,” concluded Michaels. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 25.7%, to $33.6 million, as compared to $26.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2025 increased 19.4% to $123.3 million, as compared to $103.3 million in the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to volume gains driven by same-customer cross-selling of new items, high ROI trade promotions to drive higher velocities in existing customers and new customer door expansion. Targeted pricing actions were successfully put in place and implemented to ensure the Company maintained gross margin targets. Gross profit increased 16.1%, to $9.1 million, or 27.0% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $7.8 million, or 29.3% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $30.5 million, or 24.8% of total revenues, in fiscal 2025, as compared to $30.3 million, or 29.4% of total revenues, in the prior year. The difference in gross margin was primarily attributable to commodity cost increases from historical averages as well as a non-recurring impact from construction surrounding the now-completed installation of strategic CapEx projects at the Company’s Farmingdale, NY facility. Operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 21.3% from 21.9%. Operating expenses totaled $25.7 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2025 at 20.8% of sales. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter benefitted from increased operating leverage, partially offset by strategic new hires to build capabilities, as well as a 93% year-over-year increase in marketing spend across the entirety of the fiscal year – an area of historical underinvestment – to help drive repeatable and profitable growth. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Net income for fiscal 2025 totaled $3.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income totaled 4.8% of revenue, as compared to 5.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 8.7% to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $9.2 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $11.7 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 totaled to $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in strategic capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown year-to-date, partially offset by working capital improvements. As of January 31, 2025, total debt stood at $5.1 million, as compared to $8.7 million as of January 31, 2024.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure – adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.

Title: The Prompt: Microsoft Bets Big On Its AI Future
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/04/08/the-prompt-microsoft-bets-big-on-its-ai-future/

ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Welcome back to The Prompt, Over the weekend, Meta released a cohort of new AI models called Llama 4, which it claimed perform better and more cost efficiently than OpenAI’s GPT4-o and Google’s Gemini 2.0 for tasks such as creative writing, coding and summarizing documents. One of these models, called Llama-4- Maverick, was benchmarked on the popular platform LM Arena, where people rate and compare AI models' answers. But what Meta benchmarked turned out to be different from the one it had publicly released to developers, TechCrunch reported. Instead, the social media giant benchmarked a more fine tuned version, several AI researchers noted on X and Meta mentioned in fine print in its own blog post. As a result, LM Arena said it is updating its policies for fair and "reproducible" model evaluations in the future. “Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,” it posted on X. “As a result of that we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn’t occur in the future.” The fiasco has raised concerns about the company’s claims about its models’ performance being potentially misleading and points to the fact that these benchmarks aren’t always a reliable measure for AI’s capabilities. Now let’s get into the headlines. Last week, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 90 countries that shook the stock market. While those tariffs exclude semiconductors— the powerful chips that undergird AI models— they could make imports of essential materials like aluminium and structural steel more expensive and drive up the cost of building the massive data centers where AI models are trained, Forbes reported. “By the time we have developed the capacity to domestically produce these systems, we will have lost the AI race," Gavin Baker, chief investment officer at private equity firm Atreides Management said on X. AI might have also had a role to play in coming up with Trump’s trade policies, which resemble ChatGPT’s, Gemini’s and Grok’s breakdown of how the tariffs were calculated, Verge reported. The White House denied the claims and published what it said was its formula for the calculations. Shopify’s billionaire CEO Tobi Lutke said the e-commerce giant is changing its approach to hiring in the age of artificial intelligence. Teams will be required to demonstrate why AI can’t get the job done before asking for more resources and additional headcount, according to a memo sent to employees which Lutke posted on X. Shopify’s workers are also expected to use AI in their day-to-day jobs and their performance reviews will include questions about AI usage. New York City-based Runway, which develops AI models for video and image editing, raised $308 million. It’s now valued at over $3 billion, according to PitchBook and multiple reports. The company’s tools have been used to create scenes in Oscar-winning film Everything Everywhere All at Once. Runway’s AI software is used by tens of millions of users that include Hollywood filmmakers as well as budding artists, CEO Cristobal Valenzuela told me. The appeal?

A Microsoft sign is decorated in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary at Microsoft headquarters, Friday, April 4, 2025, in Redmond, Wash. (AP Photo/Jason Redmond) On Friday, Microsoft celebrated its 50th anniversary. The company behind the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office suite of applications like Word and Excel used the occasion to highlight its innovations in artificial intelligence, which ranges from its search engine Bing to coding tool GitHub copilot to its family of small-sized language models called Phi. It also announced new capabilities for Copilot, including in-depth research and the ability to carry out specific tasks on a person’s behalf. Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, a software which allows companies to build AI apps and what’s called “agents,” systems to carry out specific tech-related tasks, is used by some 60,000 customers, Microsoft announced. (The celebration was interrupted by employees who protested Microsoft allegedly selling its software and AI tools to the Israeli military. Microsoft terminated their employment, CNBC reported.) I spoke to Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for AI platform, Eric Boyd about how the company has evolved over the years. Boyd joined Microsoft in 2009 on the Bing team. Rashi Shrivastava: Is there a key moment in Microsoft’s history where you realized the significance of this technology and how it could change the way we work in the future? Eric Boyd: For me, it really crystallized when I saw probably GPT-3.5 and this was probably about six months before ChatGPT got released and we were just playing with it. But it hadn't really broken through to the mainstream. And I remember I was really almost frustrated at the time. I'm like, how come the whole company isn't taking a bet on AI and just refactoring, refocusing everything that they're doing. And then we saw GPT-4 a few months later and we did exactly that. Satya got all of the key leadership in the company into a room and said, ‘here we have this new technology and look at it, understand it, and he gave very specific instructions. I want you to come back with plans on how you're going to incorporate this in your products. We already have spellcheck–don't make spellcheck a little bit better. I want you to rethink the way that this is going to work in your products. Every team has plans and every team threw those plans out the window and came up with new plans for how they were going to refocus on this. And it was just an astounding pivot for the company that led to just this watershed where we realized things are going to be radically different. We're going to operate in a very different way. The world's going to be different as a result of that. Rashi: What is Microsoft's vision for AI in the future? Eric: Even if we kept doing just no new models, no new capabilities, no new functionality, there's at least five years of adoption to take advantage of the technology that we've already got. But we do have new things coming and I can ask a model to understand complicated things and do reasoning and give me answers back in a chat form. It’s going to change completely again as we move into a world where we expect these agents powered by models to go and do work for them and that I'm now going to be even more productive because I can assign sort of menial tasks. We now have AI that can do that mind numbing work really efficiently at massive scale and really well and just provide tremendous benefits to people. Rashi: Can we expect to see these agents in Microsoft products like Word and some of the other tools that we use in the future? Eric: I can't imagine that we wouldn't have that. I don't have anything to announce on that, but I definitely would expect that. Rashi: How has Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI evolved over the years? It seems like the company has been shifting away its reliance on OpenAI’s models to offer models from other companies like Mistral as well as build its own. Eric: “We have a really great partnership with Open AI and we continue to work really closely with them. I have literally 20 people in my team who are sitting at OpenAI's office each and every day working side by side with their engineers on the next things that we're looking to produce and move forward on. Our commitment to our customers is that we're going to give them the best frontier models produced by OpenAI along with the best models at each point at the price performance curve. I don't see that as a change really in our relationship with OpenAI. It's just making sure that we've got the full segment, all the segments in the market really covered. In some cases, AI’s medical decisions can be better than those of human doctors, according to a new study by digital health startup K and researchers at Cedars Sinai, Tel Aviv University. Forbes reported. The study, which reviewed 460 patent visits, found that K Health’s AI chatbot, which makes recommendations and diagnoses based on the patient’s medical records and conversations with the patient, matched the doctor’s decisions in two-thirds of cases and in the remaining one-third it offered better-quality care. A representative of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has moved through a string of federal agencies to reduce headcounts and slash budgets, appears to be trying to use an AI coding tool to write code for the Department of Veteran Affairs’ codebase, according to Wired. A DOGE hire called Sahil Lavingia, gained access to the department’s systems and is reportedly trying to digitize the organization with the introduction of AI tools for different uses.

Title: No proof Trump sold $2.3B in Truth Social stock before April 2 tariffs announcement

About this rating There was no evidence, such as mandatory public filings or credible news coverage, that U.S. President Donald Trump sold his Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) shares before his April 2, 2025, tariffs announcement. However, on April 1, TMTG did reregister for sale shares belonging to Trump and several other shareholders, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At close of market on April 1, Trump's 114,750,000 shares would have been worth roughly $2.3 billion. Following U.S. President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement (archived) on April 2, 2025, a claim circulated online that Trump sold $2.3 billion worth of his Truth Social stock the day before he unveiled the tariffs. (Facebook user Cor Poll) The rumor circulated as a screenshot of a social media post and appeared on X (archived), Facebook (archived) and Instagram (archived). Text in the screenshot read: "Trump sold 2.3 billon worth of his truth social stock the day before he announced the tariffs. And other stock as well. His family did the same. What does that tell everyone?" Snopes readers also emailed us to ask about the claim. It was not possible to locate the source of the screenshot, but it appeared to be from a Facebook post due to the image that featured in the background. However, there is no evidence, such as mandatory public filings, that Trump sold his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, before the April 2, 2025, tariffs announcement. A spokesperson for a company representing TMTG described the claim as "false" and no credible news media outlets had reported on the president selling his shares as of this writing. Therefore, we have rated this claim as false. The rumor appeared to develop following a TMTG filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 1, 2025, in which TMTG reregistered certain shares — including 114,750,000 shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust — for sale. According to the SEC filing, Trump was the "settlor and sole beneficiary" of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. was the trustee. The filing, formally known as a Form S-3 Registration Statement, registered the shares for "possible sale" but left shareholders in control of when or whether to sell. Shannon Devine, a partner at MZ North America, an investor relations and corporate communications company representing TMTG, said via email that rumors the president had sold his shares were "false." "There has been no sale of President Trump's shares," Devine wrote. Trump has previously said he would not sell his shares in TMTG. If the sale was legitimate, it would have been eminently newsworthy. However, using multiple search engines, it was not possible to find any credible news reports that the sale had gone through. In a statement on April 2, 2025, TMTG called reports that it was "paving the way" for Trump to sell his shares a "fake story." The company said (link below ours): Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG. To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company's filings effective. In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares. The SEC defined an affiliate as "a person, such as an executive officer, a director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer." Devine confirmed that Trump was an affiliate of TMTG. Trump's status as an affiliate is important because affiliates are subject to tighter trading rules than non-affiliates. According to the SEC, an affiliate of a company must report via Form 144 any sale that "involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period." Had Trump sold 114,750,000 shares worth around $2.3 billion as online claims suggested, this sale would need to be reported using Form 144. The form has been publicly available through the SEC's EDGAR system since 2022. There was no Form 144 reflecting the alleged sale on TMTG's EDGAR page at the time of this writing (archived). TMTG filed its Form S-3 with the SEC on April 1. Companies in the U.S. must file a Form S-3 registration statement if they wish to raise capital after their initial Form S-1 filing. The Form S-3 registration statement offers "securities" — in this case shares — to the market, meaning it puts them up for sale. On April 2, news media outlets such as Axios, the Financial Times (FT), Business Insider and Reuters reported that the SEC filing would allow Trump to sell TMTG stock worth $2.3 billion, referring to the 114,750,000 shares held by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust. The SEC filing itself did not value Trump's TMTG stock. Rather, according to Axios, the $2.3 billion figure for Trump's shares came from the value of TMTG shares — listed on the Nasdaq composite index as DJT — at market close on April 1 of $20.26 per share. Business Insider used a slightly lower price of $19.19 per share at midday on April 1 for its calculations. Following the SEC filing on April 1 and the news reports above on April 2, DJT stock on Nasdaq dropped from $20.26 at close on April 1 to $17.09 at close on April 4. By comparison, the lowest closing price for DJT stock in April 2024 was $22.84 on April 16. (Nasdaq) On April 2 and 3, 2025, respectively, TMTG wrote to Axios and the FT. TMTG said the outlets' reporting had caused an "immediate" and "severe" drop in TMTG's stock price. TMTG further wrote that Axios and the Financial Times had misrepresented the S-3 filing as an intent to sell. In its message to Axios, TMTG wrote: Crucially, the article completely omits the critical fact, as is stated in the S-3 filing itself, that the filing consolidates prior registration statements in the form of an S-3. The Trust shares, in fact, had been registered previously—as Axios also could have discovered through a search of Google, the SEC EDGAR system, or its own reporting—and the S-3 filing did not cause or reflect a change in the status of those shares. The omission of this fact allowed Axios to misrepresent the S-3 filing as an indication of a new intention by the Trust to sell its TMTG shares. This false implication was re-reported widely throughout the media, causing an immediate, severe drop in TMTG's stock price. In its communication with the FT, TMTG said: Despite its supposed expertise in financial matters, Financial Times also failed to note that it is customary and expected—and beneficial to shareholders—for a U.S. public company to shift from S-1 to S-3 when it becomes eligible to do so. DJT was not the only large social media parent company to lose value in the days after "Liberation Day" on April 2. The stocks of Meta (Facebook and Instagram's parent company), Pinterest and Snap Inc. (photo messaging app Snapchat's parent company) all dropped between April 2 and April 7. Berkowitz, Ben.

Title: Inside the EV startup secretly backed by Jeff Bezos

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Jeff Bezos is funding a secretive EV startup based in Michigan called Slate Auto that could start production as soon as next year, according to multiple sources and documents that link the billionaire’s family office to the startup. Slate, which took root in another Bezos-connected company called Re:Build Manufacturing, has been operating quietly since its founding in 2022. The company has hired hundreds of employees while in stealth — many of whom come from Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, and Harley-Davidson. It also attracted the backing of several other wealthy individuals, including Mark Walter, the controlling owner of the LA Dodgers and CEO of Guggenheim Partners, and Thomas Tull, who is a lead investor of Re:Build Manufacturing, according to documents TechCrunch obtained from Delaware’s Division of Corporations. Slate Auto is tackling a big goal: an affordable two-seat electric pickup truck for around $25,000, according to two sources who were granted anonymity to speak about the company’s internal discussions. Leaders inside the company have mentioned the Ford Model T or Volkswagen Beetle as a North Star for the project, according to the people. It has amassed a sizable war chest in service of that goal. The company quietly raised at least $111 million in a Series A round in 2023, according to a public filing. Bezos was involved, and Melinda Lewison, the person who manages his family office, is listed as a director on paperwork Slate has filed with states and the federal government. The filing shows 16 people invested in that round; it is unclear how much Bezos put into the company. Slate has told employees that it closed a Series B late last year, according to multiple sources familiar with its funding. It has not yet filed any paperwork for the round with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Delaware paperwork shows it authorized nearly 500 million preferred shares for the Series B priced at $2.37 per share. (Slate also authorized more than 400 million shares of common stock in the past year, though the filings did not state a price.) The Delaware paperwork also lists Walter and Tull as new board members, suggesting the two invested in Slate’s Series B round. The two recently formed a $40 billion holding company to make investments. Walter and Tull could not be reached for comment. Slate hopes to get its vehicle into production as soon as late 2026 at a manufacturing facility somewhere near Indianapolis, Indiana, according to job listings, state lobbying records, and a 2024 interview with executive chairman Rodney Copes. It is not immediately clear if Slate purchased an existing factory or plans to build one from scratch. The clandestine project is taking shape at a challenging time for electric vehicles. Once-explosive growth of the sector has cooled off, and multiple startups dedicated to building EVs have filed for bankruptcy. Those that have survived, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, have done so by burning through billions of dollars. Slate plans to supplement the small margins of its low-cost truck by building out a line of accessories and apparel that owners can use to customize their vehicles and their looks, according to the sources and various job listings. It has filled its executive ranks with former Harley-Davidson and Stellantis employees — two companies that have historically leaned on these kinds of ancillary businesses (the former with apparel and the latter with MoPar parts and accessories). Slate is headquartered in Troy, Michigan, and the startup has also shown off a proof of concept vehicle to investors at a non-descript design studio it’s leasing in Long Beach, California, according to the sources. It has targeted high-net-worth individuals and kept a tight lid on its fundraising process. The company and multiple people connected to Slate, Re:Build Manufacturing, and Bezos’ family office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story. TechCrunch also reached out to Bezos directly and did not receive a response. Slate is shot through with Amazon DNA. Alongside Bezos’ family office, Slate’s Series A included funding from former Amazon executive Diego Piacentini, according to his firm’s website. Slate was initially created as a project called Re:Car in early 2022 within Re:Build Manufacturing, a domestic manufacturing incubator of sorts co-founded by former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke and his MIT Leaders for Global Operations classmate Miles Arnone. Several long-time Amazon executives, including Wei Gao, who was a top VP and technical adviser to Bezos, are now at Re:Build Manufacturing. Slate’s digital, e-commerce, and automotive experience leads are Amazon expats. Even Slate’s original name includes the “re:” prefix Amazon uses for events, like the re:MARS robotics and AI conference, or the annual re:Invent gathering for AWS. Bezos has invested in more than 30 companies through his family office over the years, touching the worlds of AI (Perplexity), robotics (Figure), defense (Anduril), and even mobility (Uber). Slate is one of the most direct investments he’s made in the world of electric vehicles outside of the relationship his company Amazon has with Rivian. His investment has largely been just that, though. People familiar with the company’s inner workings told TechCrunch that he has not been seen around Slate’s Michigan or Los Angeles offices. Nearly all of the EV startups that have come (and gone) over the last decade have tried in some way to replicate the approach Tesla took. They’ve designed their first vehicles to be high-end offerings so they can sell fewer cars for more money. Eventually, after growing brand awareness, these companies move into higher-volume, cheaper EVs that generate smaller margins. Slate is inverting this by going after what it hopes will be a buyer’s “first car,” according to the people who spoke with TechCrunch. The idea is to sell the truck at a price point of around $25,000, and have owners personalize or upgrade the car over time as they can afford it. In late March, Slate filed for a trademark on the phrase: “WE BUILT IT. YOU MAKE IT.” There is a long list of goods and services it could cover, including everything from switches and speakers to USB ports and pet harnesses. Other details can be gleaned from the many job listings Slate has posted over the last two years. One posted in 2024 hinted the company will dub the customer customization process “Slate University.” The listing was originally titled “University Lead” and was renamed to “Head of Customer Education Repair & Maintenance” before the startup stopped accepting applications. “We seek an enthusiastic, experienced Leader of Slate University to build and lead our game-changing approach to open-source content for customers to enhance their ownership experience,” the listing reads. “As the Lead, you will drive the strategy and ecosystem development for the educational content and delivery for Slate shoppers, customers, technicians, and partners.” Another job listing for “Lead Product Manager, Accessories” explains that Slate is “exploring opportunities in the electric mobility space and are building complimentary accessories, apparel, and merchandise capability.” It also mentions the person would be overseeing the development of “utility parts” and “lifestyle and personalization accessories.” This approach — subsidizing a low-margin manufacturing business with a higher-margin accessories play — is one that has been used by automakers, including Harley-Davidson with its apparel division and Jeep-maker Stellantis with its Mopar parts and service division. Unsurprisingly, Slate is already pulling experience from both of those companies as it builds out its team. The startup’s executive chairman is Rodney Copes, who spent 20 years at Harley-Davidson. Chief Financial Officer Ryan Green spent nearly a decade on the finance side of the motorcycle manufacturer. (Copes and Green also had stints at Rivian.) Slate’s heads of service, commercial, accessories product management, and growth marketing also worked at Harley-Davidson. Slate apparently plans to source its high-voltage battery pack, electric motors, and other related tech from outside suppliers, according to one job listing. The startup is “challenging the status quo of vehicle design,” according to another listing for a design/release engineer for windshield wipers. A posting for an accountant role says the person hired would have to help implement the “required systems to be a public company.” According to another role, any prospective head of PR and communications: “Must love cars! You’ll be thinking about cars all day every day, and it’s the most fun when you love cars.” Another way Slate appears to be bucking the trend of other EV startups is that it does not have a founder serving as CEO. Arnone is considered to be Slate’s founder, according to the sources who spoke to TechCrunch, but his day-to-day job is serving as CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing. Instead, Slate’s CEO is Christine Barman, a longtime Chrysler veteran. She initially got into the automotive industry through an internship at General Motors after attending Purdue University, according to a 2023 interview. She then spent more than 20 years at Chrysler overseeing the vehicle line program for the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Jeep Cherokee, according to her LinkedIn profile. Barman eventually became the vice president of electrical and electronics for Fiat Chrysler, where she led the automaker’s integration of Android Automotive and spent time working on the company’s collaboration with Waymo, before leaving the company in 2017. Barman has not spent the last decade posting online like many of her EV startup CEO peers. She instead has mostly been advising companies on emerging tech and teaching engineering before getting involved in 2022 with what at the time was a nascent EV project within Re:Build Manufacturing. Barman did not respond to a request for comment. Kirsten Korosec contributed to this report.

Title: 'The Canary Is Sick Already': Airlines Brace for Softer Demand

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Caption: Delta is set to report first quarter earnings before market open on Wednesday. Vincenzo Pace Vincenzo Pace Airlines’ post-pandemic growth will be tested as tariffs, mass layoffs within the federal government, and weakened international demand continue to create economic uncertainty. Select a question above or ask something else The post-pandemic boom for the airline industry could come to an end as tariffs, a sinking stock market, and declining consumer confidence weaken travel demand. At the start of the year, analysts expected strong results — premium and international travel would continue to be healthy, corporate travel was slowly bouncing back, and even domestic travel was starting to make a comeback. But now, the latest round of sweeping tariffs from the Trump administration has sparked fears of a potential recession. Some Wall Street leaders have already declared the U.S. is in a recession. “One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday, according to CNBC. Government travel has declined significantly following mass layoffs. And international demand from Canada, Mexico, and Europe is starting to weaken. Data compiled from Cirium found that advance bookings between the U.S. and Europe were down 12.6% compared to last year, but it cautioned that its data was primarily from online travel agencies. An open question is whether a falling stock prices will lead to lower spending by high-income flyers. Airlines have invested heavily in premium offerings as they’ve become a major profitability driver. “There’s never been a downturn where the industry has been less dependent on corporate demand, the category usually hit the hardest,” an investor note from JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker read. “On the other hand, there’s never been a downturn where the industry has been more dependent on the premium category, which has yet to be tested by a US recession.” Delta Air Lines is set to report its first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, and analysts are expecting U.S. airlines to cut their outlooks for 2025. Delta already lowered its first quarter outlook, saying in a regulatory filing that it had seen softer demand for corporate and leisure travel. “We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist US to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines and ground the multiples back in the penalty box over the near-term,” wrote TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald in a note to investors on April 4. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also cut their first quarter outlooks, citing the current economic environment as a reason. Fitzgerald said in the note that he expected legacy carriers to fare better during an economic downturn compared to ultra-low-cost carriers. “While we do expect some consumers to trade down, we believe there is greater likelihood that consumers trade down within the same carrier's cabin (e.g., moving from Premium Economy to Standard Economy) than they pivot to a low-cost carrier,” he said in the note. Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham said he expected airlines to make some capacity cuts. “2025 is clearly not the year airlines had hoped for with consumer and business confidence rattled by the Trump administration’s approach to policy in turn creating uncertainty,” the note read. Corporate demand, which was continuing to strengthen as companies changed their in-office policies, is also now in flux. Deutsche Bank noted it was seeing weaker demand for corporate transatlantic routes, most notably at London Heathrow, the largest corporate transatlantic market. However, an investor note from Raymond James noted that low fuel prices could offer airlines some reprieve. “While we expect the current policy rollercoaster ride to continue over the next year (a challenging scenario for corporate and consumer travel demand), we are modeling some improvement (albeit not full recovery) in 2H25,” the note read.

Title: Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings

This week, America’s biggest banks are set to report their quarterly earnings. But as Reuters reported Tuesday (April 8), investors are less likely to be focused on profits than on the banks’ view of the economy amid steep U.S. tariffs. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said the biggest impact of the tariffs in the quarters to come “will be higher reserves for loan losses as the odds of recession rise.” As Reuters notes, banks are likely to reserve billions for potential loan defaults in the quarters ahead. Loan losses will probably increase this year due to newly revised accounting rules that require banks to account for losses over the full terms of the loans. “Banks are a reflection of the economy — if the economy worsens, their results will follow,” said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions at Argus Research. In addition to more reserves to cover losses on existing loans, Biggar expects banks to scale back lending as they see higher risks. The report argues that banks are likely to face questions during earnings calls about the market selloff that has erased trillions of dollars from global stock indexes. Bank stocks were some of the hardest hit, after surging earlier in the year on optimism about a jump in dealmaking. This week will see Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase report their earnings, all happening on Friday (April 11). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that the tariffs could have lasting negative consequences, such as inflation and recession. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote in his annual shareholder letter. “In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” As PYMNTS noted in a report Tuesday on the impact of the tariffs on the FinTech sector, some observers have an even more pessimistic view. For example, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink notes that many U.S. business leaders believe the country is already in a recession. “Where do FinTechs fit in the larger picture? Analysts remain cautious about FinTech growth prospects, citing economic uncertainty and regulatory pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. “Despite this, there is optimism about the sector’s long-term potential, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as a robust employment market and receding inflation. However, that outlook is clouded by the current economic turmoil.” Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings Report: Justice Department to End ‘Regulation by Prosecution’ of Crypto-Related Activities Best Buy Launches Creator Program With Influencer Storefronts i2c Teams With Access Finance to Expand Credit Card in US We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Wall Street Leaders Finally Turn on Trump’s Tariffs

Wall Street titans had been oddly silent about Trump tariffs—until they became real. Amid market turmoil brought on by the President’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, a growing trickle of prominent bank CEOs and investors are raising the alarm on how these levies could cause irreparable harm to the global economy. Even established Trump supporters, such as Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman, are vocalizing concerns about the potential fallout. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Here’s a look at what Wall Street’s most prominent leaders are saying: Ken Griffin, a major Republican donor, called Trump’s tariffs a “huge policy mistake” while speaking at the University of Miami event yesterday (April 7). Griffin estimated that it could take 20 years for the tariffs to actually bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. “It’s not 20 weeks. It’s not two years. It’s decades,” he stressed. But before then, the levies will raise the cost of groceries, appliances and vehicles for middle- and lower-class families. The speech mark a departure from Griffin’s previous comments on Trump’s tariff policy, which he claimed wasn’t a particularly important business issue. “I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world,” said Griffin yesterday. “That’s the path we’re on.” Economic fragmentation caused by the tariffs could be “disastrous in the long run,” said JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon in his latest annual letter to shareholders. He warned that the levies will increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession, and he urged for negotiations to take place sooner rather than later. “America First is fine, as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone,” Dimon wrote. Dimon reportedly supported Kamala Harris during the 2024 Presidential election, the banking CEO has previously defended Trump’s tariff policy. In January, he called tariffs as an effective negotiation tactic and advised people to “get over it.” Bill Ackman, head of the hedge fund Pershing Square and one of Wall Street’s loudest supporters of Trump, has changed his tune. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” said Ackman in a series of X posts over the weekend. He described the levies as akin to “launching a global economic war against the whole world at once.” The hedge fund manager today (April 8) said that some of his comments on tariffs have been “misinterpreted” and noted that he still supports tariffs as a tool for negotiation. But he reiterated his call for a pause of up to 90 days before the tariffs come into effect to allow for negotiation. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), an economic downturn in the U.S. is already taking place and will only continue to escalate. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” said Fink yesterday while speaking at the Economic Club of New York. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” he added. Fink alluded to America’s economic uncertainty in his annual shareholder letter last week. “I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They’re more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,” he wrote. Much of the economic benefits reaped over the past eight decades can be attributed to the growth of global trade, said Howard Marks during a Bloomberg TV interview on April 4. Now, the state of the world “is completely in flux,” he said. “We’ve gone from free trade and world trade and globalization to this system, which implies significant restrictions on trade in every direction and a step toward isolation for the United States,” he added. Last October, Daniel Loeb praised Trump’s economic policy and said his tariffs would have a positive impact on the market. He isn’t so sure now. On April 5, he reposted an article on X from the conservative think-tank American Enterprise Institute that criticizes the formula the administration used to calculate the tariffs. “Thoughtful piece on potential conceptual as well as practical errors that went into the announced tariff policy,” said Loeb of the report. “It will be a test of the administration’s judgement versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days.” While hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio agrees that the U.S. has a problem to fix when it comes to domestic manufacturing, he doesn’t believe tariffs are the answer. “I agree with the problem. I am very concerned about the solution, the practicality of the solution,” he told CNBC in an interview published today. The levies will see company costs rise and their revenue plunge, said the Bridgewater Associates founder. “This is going to create great sand in the gears of production worldwide,” he added. Stanley Druckenmiller, a longtime Republican, is turning against the levies. “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10 percent,” said the billionaire investor in an X post on April 6. Druckenmiller has close ties to the Trump administration, having acted as the boss of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent when the two worked at George Soros’ hedge fund.

Title: Who was hit the hardest? Billionaires lose out as stock market crashes

(Reuters: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Pool) Wealthy tech bros, former Playboy bunnies and Australian miners are turning on Donald Trump as the fallout continues from new tariffs he imposed on America’s trading partners late last week. The US president often says "tariff" is his favourite word in the dictionary. Australia is about to feel the effects of Donald Trump's love for the protectionist trade tool. Business leaders who previously donated to Trump’s campaign or showed support for the US president during his re-election bid have criticised the widespread tariffs, which have plunged the global stock market into chaos. The tariffs were designed to deal with "the highest trade imbalances" with the United States and were wide-ranging measures taken in a bid to prioritise US manufacturing. However their sweeping nature has sparked fears of a global recession as investors sell off trillions of dollars' worth of stocks. Even with a two per cent rebound on Tuesday, Australian stocks had still lost more than five per cent - or over $100 billion - in value since last Wednesday's close. Meanwhile the world’s 500 richest people suffered the biggest two-day loss ever recorded on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, losing a collective $887 billion. Business men and women who have previously backed Mr Trump’s policies and election platform have since turned on him, with some suffering billions of dollars wiped off their overall net worth. Here's how much went missing One of Trump’s most famous advisers and the chief executive of Tesla has taken the biggest hit so far. Musk was already on a downward spiral following the boycotting of his products due to his close association with the president and his administration, but it was earlier this week that has dealt him his biggest blow yet. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index found Musk has lost $US31 billion ($51 billion) over the two-day drop, bringing his net worth to under $US300 billion for the first time since he ascended the rich list. However, the loss is not too damning for Musk – who remains clear of other billionaires to still retain his top spot as richest man in the world. Musk has not publicly reacted to the news of his losses, but he has lashed out at Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro over his defence of tariffs. He posted on X and said: “PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing”. Musk also later responded in agreement to a quote from economist Thomas Sowell: “In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it”. However, he has also shared content from the United States Trade Representative X account highlighting “unfair trade practices imposed on American exporters”. E-commerce giant and recently-turned media mogul Jeff Bezos has fared a little better than Musk across the two-day drop. The Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index found the Amazon founder had lost about $US24 billion to date. Bezos has likely lost out due to the major stock market sell-off that was triggered by escalating tariff tensions, and analysts say Amazon’s reliance on manufacturers in places like Taiwan and China could make it vulnerable in the trade war. He remains the second richest person in the world. The creator of Meta was a fixed presence throughout Trump’s campaign and joined forces with both Bezos and Musk to signal support from the technology sector. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, he lost about $US28 billion over the same period as Musk and Bezos. Like Bezos, Zuckerberg’s core business is heavily reliant on manufacturing in countries like India and China. It also relies on advertising revenue to survive, which could be impacted by any potential recession or economic slow-down. Zuckerberg has previously flagged his support for tariffs, expressing concerns European and Australian companies were unfairly targeting American tech companies with regulatory action. Just last month, he said the US government should be defending its own manufacturers and business owners against international penalties, however he has yet to comment on how the tariffs have impacted him personally. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has been the most outspoken about the impact of Mr Trump’s tariffs. He had a net worth of $US9.3 billion earlier this year, which has since fallen to $US8.8 billion — although the precise figure he lost during the market slump is not publicly available. Ackman took to X to criticise the implementation of the tariffs. "The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out," he wrote. “This is not what we voted for.” Ackman is the manager of Pershing Square Holdings. He said Mr Trump was risking an "economic nuclear war" and criticised his key advisers and their understanding of economics. "We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," he wrote. "What CEO and what board of directors will be comfortable making large, long-term economic commitments in our country in the middle of an economic nuclear war?" Closer to home is the Hancock Prospecting billionaire. Rinehart is the richest person in Australia and supported Trump throughout his first presidency in 2016. She has pushed for similar policies in Australia around removing "red tape" and a US-style department of government efficiency. Rinehart's support of the US has continued through her buying up shares in Elon Musk’s Tesla and local oil and gas companies. Rinehart's net worth according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index is about $40 billion, but the Australian Financial Review said her fortune had dropped by $280 million since the market’s downturn. Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting sells a lot of its iron ore to major trading partner China, but she has yet to comment on the implementation of tariffs on the steel markets. Hendricks is one of Trump’s most prolific donors and her net worth is about $US20.9 billion. A former Playboy bunny, Hendricks made her fortune co-founding building products distributor ABC Supply Co, which is one of the country’s largest wholesale distributors of roofing, siding and windows. The nature of the business means tariffs will likely see the price of ABC’s products increase. Early estimations by Forbes found her company would likely lose about $US650 million as the market falls. While Ms Hendricks has not commented on the impact of tariffs personally, her company issued a statement to Newsweek about their potential impact back in March, before they were announced: “We understand that ongoing market conditions, including rising raw material costs and evolving tariffs, continue to create challenges in our industry,” the company stated on March 18. “This prior week, we have begun receiving price increase notifications from our suppliers. “As a result, ABC Supply will be adjusting pricing accordingly in line with the announced increases as they come into effect.” The pain isn't over anyone — for billionaires nor the less-affluent — although some economic analysts said the sliding stock market is losing steam. Australian shares closed higher on Tuesday, with the ASX 200 gaining 2.3 per cent and all sectors rising after the sessions of heavy selling. However the Dow Jones continues to struggle as Mr Trump doubled-down on his implementation of tariffs. "The long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place [sic]," he wrote on X.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that corporate buying of Bitcoin (BTC) is most likely about to explode. In a new interview with Kyle Chasse on his YouTube channel, Hougan notes that while holding BTC in corporate treasuries is still relatively unorthodox, the same could be said about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their early days. Hougan says he sees a theme developing in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset that parallels the embrace of BTC ETFs. “Let me make an analogy to the ETF space… If you look at institutional asset managers in the crypto space, in the early days, it was only crypto native people. It was Grayscale, it was Bitwise, and there were a few others. And then you had financial institutions run not as public companies but as family-run businesses. Fidelity is run by a family, one person can make a decision – ‘I’m going into Bitcoin’ – and they did. VanEck is run by Jan Van Eck. He loved Bitcoin and they went into the space. But fast forward to today and its BlackRock and it’s Invesco, and it’s the largest institutions in the world coming into the space. You’re seeing the same thing in companies. It was Michael Saylor alone. Then it’s Michael Saylor and Metaplanet and a few others. Oh, well, Block has some Bitcoin, and Tesla may be reconsidering it, and PayPal is probably going to look at it and it’s expanding out. Why do we not think that BlackRock – the BlackRock equivalent – will come in and own Bitcoin, which is a Mag 7 company putting it on its balance sheet at five or ten percent of their massive cash pile? To me, it pattern matches exactly. People were skeptical then, and look at us today. People are skeptical now, and I think we’ll be in the same place in a few years.” At time of writing, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has the largest corporate treasury of BTC, followed by mining firms Marathon and Riot Platforms. Tesla holds the fifth-largest corporate stack of Bitcoin.

Please try again Silicon Valley companies, especially those that rely heavily on international supply chains, have seen their stocks drop precipitously since President Trump revealed his tariff plan on April 2. A 10% tariff on all imported goods went into effect on April 5 and higher tariffs on specific countries (like China and Mexico) are scheduled to begin on April 9. While it’s unclear whether all the tariffs are here to stay, companies are already acting as if Trump will deliver on his threats in the long term. More of Apple’s iPhones, famously constructed from parts sourced all over the world, may soon be assembled in India to sidestep Chinese tariffs that could raise the hardware cost of the iPhone 16 Pro by $300 each. Nintendo is delaying pre-orders for the new Switch 2 in the U.S. while it games out-market conditions. It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat. The global economy has run on international trade for half a century. So, Trump’s decision to upend the status quo is disruptive for global industries like tech. “Apple and Tesla and other leading firms are selling to people all across the world,” said economics professor Neale Mahoney, who is also director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “We’re going to really feel that in not just the stock price of these firms, but their decisions around investment and expansion, and ultimately, their decisions to pull back.” Russell Hancock, head of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies economic and social trends in the region, says he can’t see any silver lining for tech companies, whether or not they’re involved in manufacturing or consumer retail. Meta, Google and Amazon, for instance, enjoy enormous ad revenues that could suffer from a foreign retreat in spending. “Personally, I think [Trump’s new tariff regime] is crazy,” Hancock said. “What I see is instability, retaliation [from other countries], and the upsetting of international systems that have been in place for a very long time.” He also predicts more layoffs in the Bay Area if Trump doesn’t change course soon. But Hancock isn’t just talking about tariffs. The San Francisco Bay Area has historically enjoyed a proximity to top academic institutions like Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and San José State University, providing a ready talent pool and a steady stream of start-ups. However, those universities are facing uncertainties and enacting job freezes as the Trump administration tries to limit the National Institutes of Health research funding they rely on, as well as research into emerging technologies like quantum computing. The Trump administration is also taking on the H1B visa popular in Silicon Valley by shutting down the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps applicants who are struggling to get their cases processed. Tech companies are telling immigrant employees on visas not to leave the U.S., for fear they might not be let back in. “We’re already seeing that companies are expanding elsewhere, at a faster rate than they are here, in Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “If you’re a major tech company, you’ve also been adding people in Boston, Miami, London and Asia. [Tariffs] will accelerate that trend.” He also anticipates that companies and individuals from abroad will not be as keen to invest in the Bay Area as they have been over the last half century. Some Valley watchers are holding out hope that the president is rattling his sabre as a bargaining tactic to wring more concessions from the nation’s trading partners. But venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya, co-host of the mostly libertarian “All-In” podcast, said on the podcast he doesn’t believe Trump will back down because the president has consistently spoken in favor of tariffs as a macroeconomic tool to restore American manufacturing supremacy lost over the last 40 years. Missing from the public conversation, in news articles and social media, are the direct voices of tech company leaders. This is in large part due to fears of attracting negative attention from the Trump administration. “CEOs with large global supply chains can’t be outspoken on this topic publicly because they need to cut deals,” Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, wrote on social media platform X. “But this is the tone of the convos happening right now,” he added, reposting pointedly negative comments about the tariffs from tech analyst Dan Ives. “If these tariffs (in current form/rates) hold, there is no debate … it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner,” Ives wrote. Ives continued, “In one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs … and slow down US tech innovation.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy policy.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat. The global economy has run on international trade for half a century. So, Trump’s decision to upend the status quo is disruptive for global industries like tech. “Apple and Tesla and other leading firms are selling to people all across the world,” said economics professor Neale Mahoney, who is also director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “We’re going to really feel that in not just the stock price of these firms, but their decisions around investment and expansion, and ultimately, their decisions to pull back.” Russell Hancock, head of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies economic and social trends in the region, says he can’t see any silver lining for tech companies, whether or not they’re involved in manufacturing or consumer retail. Meta, Google and Amazon, for instance, enjoy enormous ad revenues that could suffer from a foreign retreat in spending. “Personally, I think [Trump’s new tariff regime] is crazy,” Hancock said. “What I see is instability, retaliation [from other countries], and the upsetting of international systems that have been in place for a very long time.” He also predicts more layoffs in the Bay Area if Trump doesn’t change course soon. But Hancock isn’t just talking about tariffs. The San Francisco Bay Area has historically enjoyed a proximity to top academic institutions like Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and San José State University, providing a ready talent pool and a steady stream of start-ups. However, those universities are facing uncertainties and enacting job freezes as the Trump administration tries to limit the National Institutes of Health research funding they rely on, as well as research into emerging technologies like quantum computing. The Trump administration is also taking on the H1B visa popular in Silicon Valley by shutting down the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps applicants who are struggling to get their cases processed. Tech companies are telling immigrant employees on visas not to leave the U.S., for fear they might not be let back in. “We’re already seeing that companies are expanding elsewhere, at a faster rate than they are here, in Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “If you’re a major tech company, you’ve also been adding people in Boston, Miami, London and Asia. [Tariffs] will accelerate that trend.” He also anticipates that companies and individuals from abroad will not be as keen to invest in the Bay Area as they have been over the last half century. Some Valley watchers are holding out hope that the president is rattling his sabre as a bargaining tactic to wring more concessions from the nation’s trading partners. But venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya, co-host of the mostly libertarian “All-In” podcast, said on the podcast he doesn’t believe Trump will back down because the president has consistently spoken in favor of tariffs as a macroeconomic tool to restore American manufacturing supremacy lost over the last 40 years.

Title: Panama Files Criminal Charges Against Chinese-Linked Canal Port Owner for Breach of Contract

Full Content:
Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores on Monday announced that he would file a criminal complaint against Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, on accusations of breach of contract over the two ports it manages at the Panama Canal. Flores, during a press conference, stated that an audit of PPC launched by his office this year found that the company, which operates two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, found evidence of breaches of contract that amount to more than $300 million losses to the Panamanian state. Flores further accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of “misrepresenting” financial figures and will therefore file criminal lawsuits against the company’s board and the authorities responsible for the 25-year renewal of PPC’s concession. “There are important findings that show amounts of more than 300 million dollars owed to us due to noncompliance with the contract. We see a renewal that also did not comply with all the procedures of law, nor does it have the endorsement of the Comptroller’s Office,” Flores said. “I want to announce that in the next few days we will go to the Public Prosecutor’s Office to file the corresponding complaints so that the directors who handled this renewal, the board of directors and the officers of Panama Ports, who will obviously have to explain to the Panamanian people before the Public Prosecutor’s Office why so much magnanimity, why so much benevolence in a contract that has been unfair,” he continued. Panama Ports Company signed a contract with Panama in 1997 that granted PPC a 25-year concession to develop and administer two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal located in the provinces of Balboa and Cristóbal. Local authorities renewed the contract for an additional 25-year period in 2021 as per the terms of the original 1997 deal, which reportedly contained automatic-renewal provisions so long as PPC complied with the agreed terms. In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez requested that the nation’s Supreme Court rule to declare the 1997 concession contract “unconstitutional” because it allegedly violated 15 articles of the Panamanian constitution. Gómez presented the request a month after the Comptroller General’s office began an audit of PPC. In March, Comptroller General Flores stated that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described them as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” PCC’s two Panama ports have been at the center of a debate initiated by President Donald Trump in December after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal and denounced China’s alleged growing influence and control of the interoceanic trade route. The two ports are among the list of facilities included in a $22.8 billion deal between Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong-Kong conglomerate that owns PPC, and asset manager BlackRock. The deal was blocked by the Chinese communist regime last week. Flores clarified at the start of his press conference that the PPC audit proceedings were signed off on January 15 but that the auditing staff physically began its labor on January 20 — the same day as the United States’ Inauguration day — stressing that the date “has nothing to do” with what international media “may possibly say” about the proceedings being a response to the U.S. statements and that the audit is an autonomous action of Panama and his office. Flores said the financial damages to the Panamanian state can be estimated from “different angles” and explained that under the original terms of the 1997 contract, Panama was receiving a percentage of the company’s profits that increased every year, reaching $27 million in 2002. In that same year, Flores further detailed, the administration of former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso modified the contract so that Panama would receive ten percent of net profits instead of ten percent of gross profits — which made the Central American nation go from receiving $27 million in 2002 to only $1.3 million in 2003. “If we had complied with the first contract in full, Panama should have received $1.337 billion during the concession period. And we only received $483 million, with a loss to the Republic of Panama of $853 million in the same period,” Flores said. “Now, that is not the company’s fault. It is the fault of many people, bad Panamanians, I tell you, who delivered what they did not have to deliver, they negotiated very badly.” “If we add this to the economic damage caused by the fact that we gave them so many tax exemptions, they did not pay the rent, this results in another $350 million more,” he continued. “In other words, the real damage for the Republic is in the order of 1.2 billion dollars at a rate of 55 approximately per year that we as a country stopped receiving.” Flores also explained that PPC used “concessionaires” to perform container transportation services, and detailed that the Panamanian State does not receive a percentage of the profits of these companies. Additionally, the Comptroller pointed out that even though the volume of containers increased, the reported profit of the company, “at least on paper,” remains practically the same. “The company where Panama has a 10 percent stake, which is Panama Ports, earns less every day with more TEUs [Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit]. I can assume that this is happening there, and so can everyone who is watching me,” Flores said. The Comptroller, who described the contract as “leonine,” stressed that PPC received $3.78 billion between 1997 and 2003 but only paid a total of $236 million to the Panamanian state, and said, “In other words, they gave us a tip.” Christian K.

Title: [US] Season of Discovery Phase 8 Patch Notes

WoW Classic Version 1.15.7 Patch Notes April 8, 2025 New Quest Content in Eastern Plaguelands Players who have completed the Phase 7 Eastern Plaguelands quest “Scarlet Activities” may speak with Leonid Bartholomew the Revered at Light’s Hope Chapel to accept the quest “Unrest at Tyr’s Hand”. This quest splits off into a few different questlines related to Scarlet Enclave content. New Area - New Avalon Go behind enemy lines in disguise as you infiltrate the town of New Avalon within the Scarlet Enclave, prior to the events that transpire within the raid. This is a small crafting-focused town with access to a few common city services, such as a bank, a neutral auction house, and an alchemy lab. New Raid Dungeon – The Scarlet Enclave Starting at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, April 10, the Scarlet Enclave raid will be available for players to enter. New Legendary Weapon Questline Raid groups progressing through The Scarlet Enclave may encounter a “Ruined Lightforge Blade” legendary quest item as a drop from a certain boss encounter. This item is the quest starter for the legendary weapon questline. Changes Classes Going into Phase 8, we want to make some changes to damage numbers coming out of Naxxramas, refine and align the durability profile of tanks, and create more room for healers to coexist. You’ll notice a lot of changes are to previous tier’s set bonuses. We wouldn’t normally touch these bonuses, but with access to these via shoulder enchants, and some Tier 3 bonuses doing a lot of the heavy lifting for some classes inside of Naxxramas,we felt these were the correct adjustments to make to ensure that gear upgrades going forward remain meaningful. Druid Hunter Mage Paladin Priest Rogue Shaman Warlock Developers’ notes: In the opposite vein as Shaman Tanks, Warlock tanks have had too high avoidance, too low durability, and this was felt by most guilds who used a Warlock main tank for something like Maexxna during Naxxramas progression. We shifted Tank Rogues away from avoidance cap in exchange for allowing them to actually take hits, and for Warlocks we plan to do the same thing by increasing their health pool in Metamorphosis, which was starting to look like it wouldn’t be able to keep up with the health pools of other tanks. DPS Tier 3 4piece damage changed to 33% of the DoT’s damage (was 75%). Pets now benefit from your Spell Haste and convert it into both Spell and Melee Haste. New effect: Metamorphosis grants 15% increased health. Dance of the Wicked now converts 70% of your critical strike chance into Dodge (was 100%). Damage dealt reduction in Metamorphosis changed to 10% reduction (was 15%). Threat increase in Metamorphosis changed to 50% (was 77%). Shadow Cleave now grants 4 spell power per defense (up from 2). Chaos Bolt changed to deal Chaos damage, which is Fire, Frost, Arcane, Shadow, and Nature damage (was just Fire) . Demonic Pact now only counts half of the spell power from Defender’s Resolve (so it is unchanged and does not benefit from the above buff). Warrior Developers’ notes: Warriors have been relying on using the active on the Tempered Interference-Negating Helmet from Gnomeregan to compete. We feel that is clunky and unintuitive to the average player, so we have removed the ability to use the gnomeregan helmets past level 59 and offset that change for Warriors with 10% attack speed for 2handed weapons, and 5% attack speed for 1handed weapons. Soul of the Titan damage increase to Heroic Strike, Slam, and Overpower changed to 10% (Was 25%). Soul of the Battle Forecaster changed to 5% crit, damage, and damage reduction when changing stances (was 10%). Soul of the Sanguinist damage changed to 15% (was 20%). Frenzied Assault changed to 40% attack speed (was 30%). Single-Minded Fury changed to 4% attack speed per stack (was 3%). Soul of the Aftershock reduces the cooldown of Shockwave by 25% (was 50%).

Title: Apple's China exposure makes it most vulnerable in US-China trade war

Time Published: 2025-04-08T16:38:00Z

A hot potato: Global financial markets posted three consecutive days of losses as the trade war between the U.S. and the rest of the world escalated. The tech sector has been hit particularly hard by President Trump's tariffs, with all major U.S. tech companies losing a significant portion of their market value. Apple has seen the hardest hit, shedding nearly 20 percent of its market cap in one of the steepest declines in the company's history before a mild recovery on Tuesday. While most major American tech companies have much to lose in a global trade war, Apple – the world's largest by market cap – is the most vulnerable of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" due to its heavy reliance on China. Most of Apple's products, including its best-selling iPhone models, are manufactured in the communist nation, meaning the proposed 50 percent tariffs would affect it more severely than most. Related: Consumers race to Apple stores as tariff fears spark iPhone rush Apple also has manufacturing partners in Vietnam, Thailand, and India, but those countries are facing increased tariffs under Trump's new plan as well. Since Apple does not currently manufacture any of its products in the U.S., analysts believe that if the proposed tariffs are enacted, the company will either have to absorb the additional costs or raise prices – potentially reducing its profit margins or losing market share. According to UBS analysts, the tariffs could increase the price of the flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max by as much as $350 if Apple chooses to pass the cost on to consumers. Despite the downturn, tech stocks staged a mild rebound on Tuesday. Hopes that President Trump might delay or soften the proposed tariffs helped lift investor sentiment. Out of the big tech "Magnificent Seven" Nvidia led the recovery with a gain of about 4%, while Meta, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet rose around 1-3%. Source: Companies by Marketcap However, the broader picture remains shaky, underscoring ongoing concerns about the impact of a prolonged trade war. Last Thursday, rumors of a potential tariff delay triggered a volatile trading session, but not before the "Magnificent Seven" lost a staggering $1.8 trillion in market value in mere days. Apple's stock plummeted nearly 20 percent over the past three sessions, wiping out nearly $640 billion in market cap. The stock is up three percent in early Tuesday trading, but still down more than 16 percent over the last five days. Meanwhile, Brazilian media is speculating that Apple could shift iPhone production to Brazil to avoid the proposed tariffs on China. While Apple has not commented on these rumors, Brazil currently faces only a 10 percent tariff under the Trump administration's new plan – far less than India, which would be subject to a 26 percent tariff. Apple has been assembling products in Brazil in partnership with Foxconn since 2011. However, these facilities primarily serve the local market with entry-level models.

Title: Pentagon’s Hegseth to Visit Panama Canal After Trump Threats

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Panama Canal Authority By Phil Stewart PANAMA CITY, April 8 (Reuters) – The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama’s government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama’s forces and said China would not be allowed to “weaponize” the canal by using Chinese firms’ commercial relationships for espionage. “Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence,” Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. “China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.” More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world’s second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth is expected to get a close-up look at the Panama Canal later on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump’s threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump’s tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth’s visit. “On the whole, this hasn’t been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama’s formal move to exit China’s Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump’s crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country’s dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal’s security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump’s southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was “reclaiming” the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration’s assertion that China’s presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. “What’s not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he’s used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn’t been,” Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama’s administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it “is, and will continue to be, Panamanian.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart; additional reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Rod Nickel and Alistair Bell) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Close-up on a woman shopping at a convenience store and checking her receipt while exiting As the stock market implodes in real time, American consumers are responding with a pragmatic acceptance of what’s coming, ready to adjust as necessary. Having already navigated a period of hyperinflation, they will apply the same shopping strategies they honed then to adapt to anticipated tariff-induced price increases. Since 2020, Americans have been on a roller coaster where prices are concerned. The consumer price index rose from an average of 1.2% in 2020 to 8% in 2022 then dropped to a still high 4.1% in 2023. Americans got a reprieve in 2024, ending at 2.9% and inflation dropped further to 2.8% in February. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the March inflation data in a few days. Shoppers adapted then – retail and food service reciepts rose from $7.4 trillion in 2021 to $8.5 trillion in 2024. And they will adapt now. “In a moment of economic tension, consumers’ quiet resilience may be the more important signal for brands to pay attention to,” said Natalie Griffith, director of cultural insights at research firm Collage, which just conducted a survey among 1,000+ Americans about the pending impact of tariffs. Overwhelmingly, consumers expect tariffs to impact prices, according to 76% of the 2000+ voters surveyed by Morning Consult for the National Retail Federation. While 37% believe governmental policies should cut the trade deficit, there is much broader support (75%) for the government to prioritize bringing down the cost of groceries and everyday goods this year. Yet, Americans are nearly equally divided as to whether the tariffs will hurt them a lot (38%) or hurt a little (31%), according to a survey among 1,645 consumer by YouGov for the Hoover Institution. However, consumers’ feelings break along demographic lines. Men tend to skew toward hurt a little (36%), while more women are in the hurt-a-lot camp (41%). And significantly more Black Americans expect tariffs to hurt them a lot (49%) versus White (35%) or Hispanics (36%). Notably, 14% in this survey are unsure. Nearly half of consumers believe they are already feeling the impact of tariffs on the prices they are paying, according to the Collage survey conducted in March before the tariffs were even announced. Experts say it will take a few weeks to months for price changes to show up at the cash register. Yet, a skeptical few (29%) believe that some companies have taken advantage of the current situation to raise prices and boost profits. For example, AutoZone CEO Phillip Daniele said in September’s earnings call that as tariff policies have “ebbed and flowed over the years,” that “we generally raise prices ahead of that.” Such anticipatory price increases are not a good idea and brands that do so will leave consumers with a bad taste in their mouths once the dust settles. “Tensions and resentment are high due to what many see as about to happen to the economy,” shared Collage’s Griffith. Given consumers’ anxieties, brands and retailers must work to calm fears and reduce consumer tension so they don’t negatively react as we are seeing Wall Street do now. The Collage survey found that 72% of consumers are already adjusting in anticipation of price increases. They are: In addition, they are delaying major purchases (23%), such as cars, electronics and appliances, stocking up before prices increase (22%) and buying second-hand goods (16%). These are value-hacking strategies that have served them well over the last few years. As McKinsey describes it, consumers are operating in a “value now” mode, not just shopping for the best price but choosing to optimize the value of their purchases. And by optimizing on day-to-day purchases, they can occasionally treat themselves, striking a balance between compromises and indulgences. The Collage survey confirms the “value now” approach. Some 53% of consumers said quality was extremely important when choosing between one product over another, compared with 48% who prioritize price. Brand reputation or trust also plays a leading role (30%), and so does their past experience with the brand (31%). In addition, over 70% say they are willing to pay more for higher-priced goods made in America – 40% if the price difference is small and 31% regardless of the price difference. “While we did find that patriotism is helping on the consumer side,” Griffith acknowledged, “it only applies if the value is clear and the product is superior. Quality and price still matter most.” As the “value-now” shopper adapts to the new tariff-shaped shopping economy, retailers and brands can alleviate sticker shock by being transparent and forthright about why prices are changing. “Consumers expect brands to be transparent about price hikes and nearly half said they’ll stay loyal if brands explain the ‘why’ and share some of the burden,” Griffith explains. Over 40% expect brands to absorb some of the increased costs instead of passing it all along to customers. For example, Walmart and Costco are leaning on Chinese suppliers to cut prices so they don’t have to burden their shoppers. And Chipotle has promised to keep prices level as long as possible even given the hit to avocado prices coming from Mexico. Offering discounts or promotions will help reinforce brand loyalty with 44% saying such incentives would make them more likely to continue purchasing. Ford is on it by offering employee discount prices to all new car buyers and Stellantis has followed suit for its Jeep, Ram and Chrysler brands. In uncertain times like these, the resilience and adaptability of American consumers will be on full display. “Consumers aren’t overreacting, but they are recalibrating,” Griffith said. Retailers and brands must do the same. They should find ways to minimize price hikes through supply chain efficiencies and selective pricing strategies. In other words, suck up some of the tariff costs, rather than passing them all along. By clearly and honestly explaining price changes, retailers and brands can reassure customers that their concerns are heard and their needs remain a priority. In these uncertain times, empathy is key — and by prioritizing customer needs, brands and retailers can foster trust and loyalty that will carry them through. See also:

Title: How Businesses Are Dealing With Impending Tariffs

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Tariffs have dominated the thoughts, discussions and decisions of business executives, investors and economists just about as soon as President Donald Trump took office. Hours after being sworn in on January 20, he announced his intention to start 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Even though these tariffs were initially delayed a month, they took effect—and the world’s businesses knew Trump’s threats were solid. As much of the world prepares to begin paying new tariffs of at least 10% tomorrow, businesses have taken different steps to assess and control the impact on their businesses, revenues and sales. Klarna and StubHub were both planning to IPO, but decided to put their market debuts on hold due to ongoing volatility. Nintendo, already facing scrutiny for the higher-then-expected $449.99 price for its new Switch 2, decided to push back last Friday’s pre-order date for the game console, citing the need to better assess levies and market conditions. Volkswagen will add an “import fee” to cars sold in the U.S. starting later this month, the New York Times reports, and is holding off on imports while it figures out tariffs. Then there are companies and industries experts are confident can get through this period with few problems. Forbes’ Phoebe Liu writes Amazon is likely to do well, largely because it has the infrastructure already in place to shift pricing to consumers and sellers and deliver items quickly and efficiently. While Amazon’s prices are likely to take a hit, analysts told Liu, everyone else’s prices will experience the same, so Amazon will perform relatively well. The National Retail Federation also delivered a sanguine forecast for the industry, saying they expect no tariff-related changes to their annual forecast, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The retail group isn’t ignoring the impact of tariffs, and they acknowledge that consumer and business confidence may be dropping, but NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said it’s not time to count out the American consumer. As uncertainty persists, finance departments are looking to save their businesses money wherever possible. And even though fewer M&A transactions are going forward this year than predicted, some dealmaking is taking place. One area that’s often overlooked—and can be quite costly—is third-party service contracts. I talked to Nate Buniva, a partner at business and technology consulting firm West Monroe , about how not to lose money on contracts in a transaction. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. It’s spring break season and we’ll be taking next week off from Forbes CFO. We’ll be back on Tuesday, April 22. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Stocks rallied slightly Tuesday morning over a bit of optimism that Trump may be willing to cut tariff deals. He wrote on social media that he had a “great call” with South Korea’s Choi Sang-muk, and “China also wants to make a deal, badly.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on CNBC that he believes “we can end up with some good deals” if other companies come to the table. Regardless, Wall Street has not reacted well to the idea of tariffs. Since Trump’s announcement, the Nasdaq is down 8.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 7.8%, and the S&P 500 is down 8.3% Warnings are incoming from many economists and banks. JPMorgan Chase issued 60% odds of a recession, labeling Trump’s policies as the “largest tax increase” since 1968, which will “fall heavily on the US consumer.” Goldman Sachs increased their recession odds to 45% on Sunday, and cautioned that unless Trump capitulated, recession is their baseline economic forecast. UBS Investment Bank chief strategist Bhanu Baweja described the economic issue with tariffs as “a manmade problem, concentrated really around one man.” And if Trump were to change his mind, “suddenly the whole algebra changes.” Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov surveyed 50 top Wall Street investors, more than half of whom initially supported Trump’s policies, and found that their confidence in him is gone. Nearly three-quarters say his plan has been ineffective, and 54% of former supporters say he is failing. At the very least, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman, Trump’s tariffs are risking the U.S.’s reputation as a stable and predictable global partner for trade and investment—something that might be extremely difficult to get back in the years when Trump is out of office. Federal employees rally in support of their jobs last month outside a federal building in Chicago. Unemployment is climbing, according to figures from the Labor Department last week. In March, the U.S. added 228,000 non-farm jobs, more than economists’ estimates of 140,000. But unemployment was up to 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% forecasts. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed a 60% increase in March layoffs, with more than 275,000 jobs eliminated last month. Nearly 80% of those cuts were in federal government jobs through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Last month’s numbers were the highest since Covid-19 pandemic-related cuts in spring 2020. Court orders have directed the federal government to rehire more than 26,000 of those terminated employees so far, but the government is continuing to appeal and most of the employees appear to be on paid administrative leave for the time being, CBS reports. However, Trump continuously touts his tariffs as a job creator: Companies will be drawn to start manufacturing products in the U.S. again, so they will build factories that will employ Americans. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that’s an inaccurate way to look at the situation. Manufacturing has always been alive and well in the U.S., and the industry is at record-high levels from a productivity standpoint. Many items that are not manufactured in the U.S. today are inexpensive or commodity products, which is keeping with the country’s development as technology improves. Even if lower-level manufacturing comes back to the U.S. as a result of tariffs, it takes years to plan, build and staff a factory, so changes are years away. A sign at a Capital One Café in Miami. The $35 billion merger of Capital One and Discover made it past the Justice Department’s antitrust review, bringing the deal closer to the finish line, according to multiple reports. When the deal was first announced in February 2024, many analysts questioned if it would go through. President Joe Biden’s administration halted several mergers for antitrust reasons, including JetBlue’s planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and Kroger’s planned purchase of Albertsons. The New York Times reports that in January, before Trump’s inauguration, Biden’s Justice Department had drafted an interim memo that outlined concerns that the Capital One-Discover tie-up could harm consumers. The merger is not a done deal yet. It still needs approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Analysts believe the Justice Department would be the most likely to object; the Times writes the Federal Reserve hasn’t denied a bank merger application since 2003. But if this goes through, it’s the first big financial deal that will have made it through the Trump Administration’s brand of scrutiny. Nate Buniva, partner at West Monroe. Every business has third-party contracts for services and IT platforms, which can often be forgotten during an M&A transaction. Nate Buinva, a partner at management and technology consulting firm West Monroe, is an expert at paying attention to these contracts—which he said can save 40% to 60% in a transaction if managed correctly. I talked to him about how to properly handle third-party contracts on both sides of an M&A deal. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Are there any types of contracts that tend to be overlooked more than others? Buniva: It’s a lot of work to read the T’s and C’s of these large enterprise agreements and understand what it can mean from a dollars and cents perspective. Often the contract piece does get overlooked or just not talked about. It’s like: This is what we spend on our ERP, this is what we spend on our collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams, but there’s not always that double click of: In this merger, do we have the right to terminate one agreement and get [the new entity] on the other, or are we going to be held with double cost? Reading through these legal documents is not the most exciting, and M&A transactions move quickly, too. You have to do the 80/20 rule, and get up to speed quickly on what you have, and make educated decisions to move forward. Is there anything that companies planning to be involved in an M&A transaction in the near future should consider when they get into contracts? Absolutely. You want to put in clauses that contemplate where you have the ability to scale the way you can structure your pricing in a tiered fashion, whereas volume goes up, you see a preferred discount on a per-unit level. Let’s say you currently only have 100 service requests right now, and you would do a tier that would take you up into the thousands. The reason you’re tiering it so high, when you do acquire a new company, you are already set up with your existing providers at a price point that says: I want you to honor this discount because I’m bringing you this extra volume. You don’t want to be in a position of doing that acquisition and you’re paying the 100-unit rate, but your volume’s 1,000. You can put in change-of-control language that says pricing or the terms need to be reevaluated if there is a change of control and you’re being sold off or absorbed. Even if you're not contemplating a transaction in the future, you never know what’s going to happen. You may as well put it in. More and more vendors are open to that because in general, yes, they may have to provide more discounted pricing, but they want the additional volume. What advice would you give to a CFO on either side of a transaction? It takes a dedicated team. My guidance is to make sure you’ve cleared people's bandwidth internally and do a review of your third-party agreements. I would also recommend they bring in an expert externally to look at this stuff and build an inventory. Oftentimes, your procurement, IT or finance orgs don’t necessarily have the subject matter expertise. Your legal team will know what contractual rights you’ll have, but they don’t know where the market is on what you can negotiate out of or what tools you can use. Every department has their own contracts. If you don’t have it, build a centralized database. You’re going to want to look at when does the contract end? How much are you spending? What’s the service? Do you have termination rights? As you contemplate the transaction, you need to start talking with the other entity about what they have and where there’s overlap, or if you're being sold off, what gaps will you have as a new entity where you need to now go stand up your own agreements. All of that takes a lot of time and runway, so the other piece of advice is do it ASAP. Where you don’t want to be—and this is when we’ve been called in the past—is at the end hour: Oh my gosh, we’re going to be a standalone company next month. We don’t have a Microsoft agreement. We can do that, but if it had been a more thoughtful journey, then you can get better pricing, terms, service levels, all of that stuff across all of your services. Oftentimes CFOs are focused on what’s the cost synergy, the headcount reduction or the opportunity to scale this business? But third-party spend is a huge component of that. Elon Musk, who is slashing government spending through DOGE, has spoken out against tariffs. Forbes’ John Hyatt examines how much Musk’s business empire has to lose through the new taxes levied by Trump. 20%-25%: Proportion of car parts Tesla imported last year from nations excluding Canada. About 40% of battery materials come from Chinese suppliers $68 million: Value of a Starlink contract canceled by Ontario Premier Doug Ford in response to Trump’s trade war. Starlink, a division of SpaceX, does business in more than 125 countries ‘Economic Armageddon’: How Dan Ives, global head of technology research for Wedbush Securities, described the tariffs’ impact on the automobile industry, including Tesla As DOGE rampages through the federal government, billions of dollars in grant money and contracts are being cut. Here are 10 things all federal contractors should do, both those who are seeing funding canceled and those who may yet be on the chopping block. Even though many CFOs and CIOs say they work well together as a unified team, there are often serious differences when it comes to ownership and ROI for tech investments, and that can lead to botched tech rollouts. Here are some tips to improve that relationship for maximum success. Last week, a CEO used profanity on a live interview with CNBC as he reacted to his company’s stock price falling after a poor earnings report and Trump’s tariff announcement. In the days since, this CEO has said the tariffs will actually help his company. Which company does he lead? A. BlackBerry B. Restoration Hardware C. Penguin Solutions D.

Title: Billionaires—Including Elon Musk—Speak Out Against Trump’s Tariffs: ‘Huge Policy Mistake’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect Wednesday over the concerns of many of the nation’s billionaires, as even some longtime supporters of the president—including Elon Musk—have expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact on the economy. Elon Musk arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol ... More Rotunda on January 20 in Washington, DC. Jamie Dimon: The JPMorganChase CEO told Fox Business on Wednesday he thinks a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s tariffs—though he said he’s right now taking a “calm view” of the financial situation, “But I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here”—after Dimon expressed concerns in his annual letter to shareholders Monday morning, saying they “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.” Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO shared a video early Monday of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade and the benefits of importing goods and reportedly lobbied Trump personally not to impose the tariffs, The Washington Post reported Monday. He’s also been sparring with Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro for praising tariffs—most recently saying Tuesday Navarro is a “moron” who’s “dumber than a sack of bricks”—and Musk’s brother (and Tesla board member) Kimbal Musk has criticized the tariffs as a “permanent tax” on Americans. Bill Ackman: The hedge fund manager is a longtime Trump supporter but has repeatedly spoken out against the president’s tariffs, calling Tuesday for the White House to issue a 30, 60 or 90-day pause on the tariffs “to enable negotiations to be completed without a major global economic disruption” and saying Wednesday morning the financial chaos Trump’s tariffs have sparked are “not the markers of successful policy” and “many small businesses will go bankrupt” if they’re not paused soon. Ken Griffin: The Citadel founder—and major Republican donor—said at an event Monday that Trump’s tariffs are a “huge policy mistake,” with Bloomberg reporting he urged audience members to lobby Trump to step back on the tariffs and said he’s “really afraid of [the U.S.] abdicating our role of leadership for the free world.” Daniel Loeb: While Loeb said in February he thought Trump’s initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn’t harm the stock market, the hedge fund manager has spoken out against Trump’s more sweeping policy, sharing a post Monday that noted the stock market chaos is “all in the head of 1 person. Who can change his mind at any time”—writing, “Exactly”—and sharing criticism of the tariffs by billionaire Ken Griffin and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Larry Fink: The BlackRock CEO suggested at the Economic Club of New York Monday that “the economy is weakening as we speak” and the market could fall another 20% from where it is now as a result of Trump’s tariffs, CNBC reports. Fink suggested the U.S. is “probably in a recession right now,” but he still expressed some optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook, saying, “In the long run, this is actually more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity” and “the vitality of the United States will persist.” Joe Lonsdale: The Palantir cofounder said on X he has some concerns about the tariffs even though he understands where “some” of the Trump administration’s thinking “is coming from,” and shared a post on tariffs from Viahart founder Molton Hart early Monday, saying Hart’s argument that the “tariffs are structured in the wrong way” by taxing finished products and components at the same rate “reflects a lot of my key concerns about how the tariffs could be done better.” Ken Langone: The Home Depot cofounder and GOP megadonor told the Financial Times he believes Trump has “been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation” and criticized how the tariffs were calculated—saying, “I don’t understand the goddamn formula”—telling the FT it would have been “more manageable and certainly more constructive” for the Trump administration to impose baseline 10% tariffs on foreign imports before starting negotiations. Ray Dalio: Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, wrote Monday the tariffs are based on a broader “breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” He’s still expressed concern about Trump’s tariffs and their “practicality,” however, telling CNBC on Tuesday that while he “agree[s] with the problem” the tariffs are aimed at fixing, “I am very concerned about the solution.” Stanley Druckenmiller: Longtime hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller expressed some optimism about tariffs in an interview with CNBC, referring to them as the “lesser of two evils” versus an income tax—though an unverified social media account believed to belong to Druckenmiller responded to a clip of his interview Sunday, arguing he “do[es] not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Ken Fisher: The Fisher Investments chairman attacked Trump’s tariffs Monday, saying on X the tariff plan is “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools,” predicting it “will fade and fail.” Thomas Peterffy: Contrary to many other billionaires, the Interactive Brokers founder has fully embraced Trump’s tariffs, telling Forbes on Tuesday he “think[s] it gives an opportunity to many entrepreneurs to gear up for producing and inventing either the same things that foreign countries sell us at cheap prices, or proper substitutes for them,” and claiming any price hikes will affect “plastic sh-t from China that is not absolutely necessary for people to have.” More than $10 billion. That’s how much Trump’s top 10 billionaire donors lost in the stock market on Thursday alone, as stocks plunged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement. That’s only a fraction of the $270 billion in total that was wiped off the net worths of the world’s billionaires on Thursday, Forbes calculated, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Musk among those who were the hardest hit. Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk called Trump “the most high tax American President in generations” on Monday. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Tesla shareholder said on X. Peterffy criticized his fellow Trump-friendly billionaires who have spoken out against the president’s tariffs, telling Forbes, “I think that they are short term, greedy, looking after their own pockets.” Trump has dug his heels in on his tariffs and repeatedly doubled down in support of them, even as they’ve spurred chaos in the markets. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social after his tariffs took effect. The president staunchly defended his tariffs to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” in terms of the U.S.’ trade with other countries, and that while other presidents wouldn’t be willing to impose such controversial tariffs, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.” Trump’s tariffs have also garnered criticism from a number of non-billionaires who have typically been sympathetic to the president. Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy has suggested he’s lost up to 15% of his net worth as a result of the stock market plunge from Trump’s tariffs and said “everything’s in the s—-ter” because of the president’s policy—but also has continued to back the president, saying Trump is a “smart guy” even as he dubbed Monday’s stock market plunge “Orange Monday.” “I’m gonna roll with [Trump] Trump has suggested he’s open to negotiating with other countries on their tariffs, saying Monday that discussions with other countries would begin “immediately” and telling reporters he’s open to reaching “fair deals” with other countries that put “America first.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said Trump will negotiate with other countries—likely starting with Japan—but has suggested those negotiations may take a while, telling Fox Business on Monday that all the countries approaching the Trump administration about making deals means “it’s going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June.” The White House denied reports Monday suggesting the administration was considering a 90-day pause, however, decrying the rumor as “fake news,” and Trump said Monday he’s “not looking at” pausing the tariffs unilaterally. Congress could also undo Trump’s tariffs, and bipartisan legislation has been introduced that would require any tariffs the president wants to impose to be approved by Congress. That legislation remains a longshot to pass as of now and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has reportedly urged House Republicans to back Trump’s policy—though some GOP lawmakers are already backing the legislation, and more could follow suit if Trump’s tariffs continue to wreak economic havoc. A Florida-based stationery company is also challenging Trump’s authority to enact tariffs in court—with potentially another major legal challenge on the way this week from business groups—though it remains to be seen how those will play out. Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy during a “Liberation Day” event Wednesday, levying tariffs of 10% and up on imports from nearly all foreign countries—even uninhabited ones. The tariffs fulfill a longtime promise by the president to impose sweeping tariffs in order to restore manufacturing to the U.S. and punish other countries for purportedly unfair trade practices, which Trump has pushed despite economists long warning that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. Billionaires’ criticism of Trump’s tariffs comes after dozens of them backed the president in the November election. More than 50 billionaires expressed support for Trump and billionaires funneled millions into his campaign, even as the now-president made sweeping tariffs a signature plank of his platform.

Title: Trump was touting his Panama victory. Then China stepped in.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to “take back” the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing. The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week. But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China’s national interests. NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was “vital” to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999. Trump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to “reclaim” the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes. Visiting Panama on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s pledge to “take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence.” The U.S. “will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation or integrity,” he said. China, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth’s remarks “irresponsible.” “We advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday. Panama also denies Trump’s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side. On Monday, Panama’s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021. CK Hutchison’s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2. Trump quickly declared victory. “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal. The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “It represents a major victory for the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, adding that is something China “would not want to happen.” Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal. China “firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week. Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China’s national interest. Beijing’s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review “to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.” The original signing date of April 2 came and went last week. While neither BlackRock nor CK Hutchison has publicly commented on the delay, analysts say that in light of the cumulative 54% tariff the United States imposed on China, the ports could be used as a bargaining chip for China to extract concessions from the United States. “What seems more important is China’s effort to gain leverage in negotiations with Trump,” said Angela Zhang, a professor of law at the University of Southern California and author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism.” While the deal does not involve Hutchison’s ports in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, CK Hutchison is publicly listed in Hong Kong, which, Zhang said, could mean China “may have jurisdiction,” even if the transaction “itself occurred offshore.” The review by Beijing’s market regulator is an example of China’s asserting its “long-arm jurisdiction over offshore transactions,” she added. BlackRock declined a request for comment. CK Hutchison did not respond to a request for comment. For Panama, the deal’s failure “would be seen as snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Hernandez-Roy said. “There would be tremendous pressure on Panama to cancel the concessions,” he said, referring to the port operation rights that Hutchison PPC won in 1997. Nevertheless, some analysts say CK Hutchison, which is not financially dependent on the Chinese government, is expected to press ahead with the deal. Li, CK Hutchison’s 96-year-old owner, has been known to draw Beijing’s ire. “Beijing is a bit skeptical about Li’s family. But the family still remains to be one of the most influential, if not the most influential, conglomerates in Hong Kong,” said Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute. “I think what they are actually doing is to diversify the risk, as Trump is getting more and more high-profile about the ports in Panama,” he said. “And during turmoil in the global economy, cash is king.” Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Alongside the now live 2025 Samsung AI Vision smart TVs with Galaxy Watch gesture control, the brand has also now debuted its brand-new 2025 3D and OLED Odyssey monitors – they are now up for preorder with up to $300 in FREE credits. The brand also re-stocked all of the colors on the Galaxy S25 Ultra with straight up $200 price drops across all of them while Amazon has dropped its ultra-affordable Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet from $220 down to $158. We also spotted up to $700 in savings on TCL’s 2025 144Hz QD mini-LED smart Google TVs and the launch of the wonderful metal Arc Pulse bumper cases for Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra. All of that and more awaits below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. Samsung recently expanded its Odyssey gaming monitor lineup by announcing the launch of new 3D and OLED models last month. There are a total of three new models, all of which are now up for pre-orders directly at Samsung with FREE credits. You are looking at two 27-inch and an ultra-wide 49-inch G9 display, and the prices for these start at $999.99 shipped. Folks who took advantage of the limited-time Reserve campaign will also see a bonus $50 off on top of the $300 in savings right now until these monitors officially hit the shelves. Head below for a closer look at the monitors and more details. All three monitors, as previously mentioned are now up for pre-orders. The prices start at $999.99 shipped, and they all come with FREE credits. You’ll also see an additional $50 credit if you reserved the units as a part of the reserve campaign, though the new offers with FREE credits are still worth looking into. Today, Arc is launching its wonderful metal Arc Pulse bumper cases for the new Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphones. Up until now, the Arc’s special brand of smartphone protection has only been available on iPhone models, the latest Google Pixel 9 devices, and previous-generation Galaxy handsets, but it is finally ready to begin taking orders on the new S25 Ultra Arc Pulse Bumper Cases. Head below for more details. We came away thoroughly impressed with the latest iPhone 16 Arc Pulse bumper cases after going hands-on last fall when Apple debuted its latest. Fast forward to today, some two months after Samsung’s latest S25 lineup took the Android world by storm, and Arc is now ready to deliver its unique smartphone case to the latest Galaxy devices. Bumper cases really aren’t for everyone, but if they are for your or you’re considering dabbling in the ultra-minimalist bumper case world, the Arc Pulse lineup is easily one of the best you’ll find anywhere. Made from aerospace-grade metals with a friction-based attachment system that requires no messy adhesives, the two piece case (if you want to call it that), quickly and securely snaps onto either side of your device to provide corner and camera array protection, while also raising your device off the table top like any normal case when you rest it down. Arc Pulse is designed to enhance your phone experience while offering an exceptional blend of aesthetics and phone safeguarding. Crafted from aerospace-grade Aluminum, the smartphone case provides a delightful tactile experience while ensuring phone protection. The outer metal shell distributes the impact while a custom inner layer absorbs the shock. Enhance your phone safety and elevate your style with a statement accessory. The pre-orders offers on the latest Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra smartphones were wild, with deep discounts, enhanced trade-in offers, and some seriously notable bundle offers with the add-on gear. While these savings have long since come and gone now, Samsung has now re-stocked all colors of its flagship Galaxy S25 Ultra and is now offering a straight up $200 in savings on all of them with a trade-in requirement. Again, there were some wild deals during the pre-order phase and closer to launch, but if you missed out on those there are now some notable savings to take advantage of with all of the color options on the new S25 Ultra now back in-stock. Considering how hard it is to determine how Trump tariffs might affect both already-released gear and upcoming launches, it might be worth at least considering some of the savings up for grabs right now while you still can. While it appears Samsung hasn’t re-stocked all of the colors on the more affordable S25 and S25+ variants like it has on the S25 Ultra, there are some deals floating around right nonetheless. If you’re looking to sidestep Amazon’s budget-friendly Fire tablet in your search for an ultra-affordable tablet, Samsung’s latest Galaxy Tab A9+ should be on your radar. Regularly $220 and currently marked down to $159.99 directly from Samsung, Amazon actually has it right now for a few bucks less at $157.19 shipped. You’re looking at nearly 30% in savings and the lowest price we can find. While we did see this one drop to $150 for a very brief time for part of the recent Amazon Big Spring Sale last month, today’s deal is otherwise the best price of the year – the only deals better than these were during Black Friday and Prime Day last year. While this is clearly no flagship S10+ or S10 Ultra – the new mid-range Galaxy S10 FE models are coming soon and you can already secure a FREE $50 reserve credit towards your purchase of one (they are set to go live on April 10 and you can get all of the details right here) – the Tab A9+ can make for a notable casual tablet experience. Landing you in the Galaxy family at just over $150 shipped right now, it comes complete with an 11-inch display, a Dolby Atmos “cinema-like audio experience,” the 7,040mAh intenral battery, a “safe place to learn and play with the Samsung Kids app,” and more – all running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chip. Here’s our launch coverage for more details. The new 2025 TCL QM6K QD mini-LED smart Google TV lineup has arrived and we are now tracking even lower prices than our initial mention to deliver new Amazon all-time low pricing across various sizes. The deepest deal of the lot lands on the 85-inch model at $1,299.99 shipped. This model launched at $2,000 in early February and is now seeing a deep 35% price drop for $700 in savings off the list price. Head below for additional details and price drops on the more modest sizes. The new QM6K model sport TCL’s latest QD mini-LED panels featuring its Halo Control System – “an advanced Technology Suite that includes the New Super High Energy LED Microchip, Condensed Micro Lens, Micro OD Reduced Optical Distance, High Contrast HVA Panel, Enhanced QLED, Zero Delay Transient Response, Bi-direction 23-bit Backlight Controller, and Dynamic Light Algorithm for Stunning “Halo-Free” Images.” That’s on top of the updated Matte HVA Panel, maintaining an “ultra-high native contrast ratio of 7000;1” alongside a 144Hz native refresh rate, up to a “blistering fast 288 VRR” Game Accelerator, Auto Game Mode (ALLM), and AMD Freesync Premium Pro for your new Switch 2 or PS5 Pro. From there, you can also expect everything to run on the Google TV platform, with onboard Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay 2 casting, built-in Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice commands, and four HDMI inputs. As part of its spring sale, OnePlus has now upped the ante on the discount for its latest OnePlus Pad 2. You can now land one at $100 off using code SPRING25 at checkout, while also claiming a FREE official Stylo add-on regularly worth $100. Alongside the free shipping here, you’re looking at a total of $200 in savings and a deal on par (in terms of value) with our previous mention – this is $650 worth of gear for $449.99 shipped. Details below. As per usual, all you’ll need to do is navigate to the listing page, and then scroll down to the “Free Gift” section to claim your freebie. You can choose between the regularly $100 OnePlus Stylo stylus or the regularly $40 OnePlus Folio Case 2. And then just add everything to your cart by hitting the “Buy Now” button and apply code SPRING25 at checkout. While our previous mention on this tablet came with a FREE $150 keyboard case, the straight cash deal on the tablet itself wasn’t quite as good ($50 off instead of the $100 off we have today). Depending how much you value the various freebie add-ons here, you’re looking at roughly the same value on both options and one of the best deals we have tracked. This is the latest OnePlus tablet, complete with a CNC aluminum unibody frame and a 12.1-inch 3K LCD display powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and 12GB of RAM. Everything else you need to know awaits right here and you’ll find the latest from OnePlus below: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More. Check out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:

Title: Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta follow Nvidia in Magnificent 7 stock rally
URL: https://qz.com/tesla-microsoft-meta-nvidia-big-tech-rally-tariffs-1851775247
Time Published: 2025-04-08T15:59:00Z

The trade-war selloff took a breather earlier on Tuesday, buoying Big Tech firms including Nvidia (NVDA+18.57%), Tesla (TSLA+21.35%), Meta (META+14.21%), and Microsoft (MSFT+9.81%), after a mixed day on Monday and two especially gnarly days last week wiped $1.8 trillion off the market value of leading tech stocks. The moment’s shifting investor outlook seemed wrapped up in hopes that deals will soon emerge from President Donald Trump’s tariff talks; investors chased that glimmer of light by boosting Nvidia stock by more than 5% earlier in the day. Nvidia then shed most of those gains; it was up 1.4% at around 2:40 p.m. Eastern, while Tesla was down roughly 2%, Microsoft and Meta were mostly flat, Amazon (AMZN+11.18%) was down 0.8%, and Apple (AAPL+15.02%) was down 3.2%. Regarding the president’s as-of-yet unrealized tariff deals, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that he thinks investors will “see a couple of big trading partners do deals very quickly.” Just yesterday, Big Tech’s recent losses had the stocks of Apple, Microsoft, and Google’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL+8.80%) approaching one-year lows. Apple, which relies on factories in China to build its iPhones, is among the tech giants most vulnerable to sweeping tariffs. A temporary workaround for the Cupertino firm may include sending more of its India-built iPhones to the U.S. market to dodge the worst of the president’s tariffs. Temporarily exempt chipmakers and advertising giants (think: Nvidia and Meta) may fare better than hardware-focused companies such as Apple, but no tech giant is invulnerable to the fallout. Tariffs could take a bite out of the corporate ad budgets that firms like Meta subsist on, while tariffs-induced price hikes could slow gadget sales and ultimately hit chipmakers’ bottom lines.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock Too Cheap?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Trefis Question: Why would an investor pay 30 times earnings for Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) when Nvidia stock is trading at 33 times earnings? It wouldn't make much sense, especially when considering these three key points: Some might consider Nvidia a “safe haven,” but its track record during market downturns tells a different story. For example, Nvidia stock dropped more than 65% during the 2022 inflation crisis. In 2020, amid pandemic uncertainty, the stock fell over 35%. Most significantly, during the 2008–2009 financial meltdown, Nvidia shares plummeted by 85%. Clearly, NVDA isn't a safe stock. For more detail, see our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? along with analysis of previous market crashes. That said, Nvidia’s stock has already seen a considerable correction, falling from nearly $150 at the start of the year to below $100. For investors looking for a potentially steadier, high-performing approach, the Trefis High Quality portfoliomay be worth considering. This strategy has delivered over 75% returns since inception, as shown in its HQ performance metrics. If you believe in the continued rise and expansion of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be an attractive long-term play at current valuation levels. Nvidia essentially serves as an “arms supplier” in the AI arena. Investing in Nvidia is not a bet on any one player like OpenAI, Google, or Amazon, but rather on the backbone that supports them all. The AI race is still developing, and companies are pouring in resources. For example, Google’s infrastructure-related capital expenditure is approximately $75 billion, showing the scale of the investment. Despite the optimism, Nvidia does face risks. Earnings could fall short of expectations, or growth might slow from 50% to around 30% as businesses tighten spending. Additionally, clients might pursue more efficient AI models, lessening the need for Nvidia’s chips. Unpredictable events could also negatively impact the stock. These factors suggest that downside risk—as much as 40%—is possible. Selling during such dips could hurt investors more than holding through volatility. Nonetheless, for long-term investors with a 3-5 year outlook who can tolerate swings, Nvidia at today’s levels may be a compelling entry into the AI revolution. Those interested in navigating downturns or potentially gaining from them might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has beaten its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices). Consulting with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets may also be wise. Remember, many fortunes are built by those who stay calm and strategic in volatile markets.

A month ago on Mar. 6th, Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. So far, the value of the Bitcoin held in that reserve has declined by over 12%.

A digital asset trust bank is like a regular bank, but it’s allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, while Anchorage also specializes in staking, trading, and governance. The world’s largest asset manager may use several custody accounts at the San Francisco-based bank to maintain funds for its $45 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, and $1.8 billion iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, or ETHA, BlackRock stated in the filings. Anchorage’s arrangement with BlackRock underscores the asset manager’s “ongoing risk management approach” and “expanding presence in the digital asset space,” BlackRock stated. BlackRock had already tapped crypto exchange Coinbase as a custodian for its two crypto funds, alongside several other asset managers that launched new products for the industry’s two largest cryptocurrencies by market value last year. “We are excited by the opportunity to set a new standard for tailored access to the digital asset class,” Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. “We are helping BlackRock to meet client demand for today and tomorrow.” So far, Coinbase has been dominant in securing billions of dollars' worth of digital assets for the Wall Street products. Asset manager VanEck custodies its Bitcoin ETF with crypto exchange Gemini, while financial titan Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing its Bitcoin fund. Anchorage entered into a custody arrangement with crypto asset manager 21Shares in September, safeguarding funds for its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The digital asset trust bank also began supporting tokens on layer-1 network Aptos, including BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), in December. BlackRock’s custodial arrangement with Coinbase will not be affected by the firm’s new deal with Anchorage, which received its federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in January 2021, the asset manager said. BlackRock isn’t planning on moving funds to Anchorage from Coinbase, but it can decide how funds are split between the two firms at its “sole discretion,” the asset manager stated.

Meanwhile, other leading chip makers, including Broadcom (AVGO+18.30%), Intel (INTC+17.35%), Micron Technology (MU+18.07%), Lam Research (LRCX+17.56%), Applied Materials (AMAT+16.17%), Samsung, and Cisco (CSCO+8.93%) were also up Tuesday. Nvidia’s slide accelerated last week after HSBC analyst Frank Lee downgraded the stock from a “buy” to a “hold,” noting that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Meanwhile, other chip stocks were getting better reviews from analysts. For instance, GuruFocus research shows that Broadcom has received a “Strong Buy” rating from nearly 88% of brokerage analysts. Trump’s trade war had sunk chip stocks as fears over slowing demand and high prices took hold. However, semiconductors are exempt from new tariff rates imposed on a slate of countries, which should insulate chip makers from some tariff turmoil. Also of concern: Data centers planned by major IT companies have been delayed or shelved as uncertainty surrounding ROI increases. Microsoft (MSFT+9.81%) announced yesterday that it has abandoned its $1 billion data center project in Licking County, Ohio, citing a strategic investment review.

Other altcoins have also significantly outperformed the overall crypto market in the past 24 hours. Cardano rose 6.3%, far outpacing the Bitcoin price rise of 4%. Meanwhile, Chainlink is up 8% in the same period, posting similar gains to Dogecoin and Avalanche. The vast majority of cryptocurrencies have registered notable price increases today, with the entire crypto market cap up by 1.8% to $2.62 trillion over the past day’s trading. Still, amid ongoing debate and concern about the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, even the best-performing altcoins are down week-on-week and month-on-month. Many high-profile figures within the world of finance, such as hedge fund boss Ray Dalio, are predicting a longer-term slump in equities and the U.S. economy, which some believe could spill over into digital assets. Dogecoin's rise has left it still 9.8% lower than it was this time last week and DOGE is trailing its price from last month by 16.4%. It’s now down roughly 58% since its recent high of $0.36, around the time of Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, AVAX has slipped 9.3% since last week and 10.7% month-on-month. But regardless of the market’s recent boost today, institutional money does seem to have been retreating from crypto assets over the past week. According to data from Farside Investors, money has left the largest Bitcoin ETFs for the past three straight trading days—totaling $268 million. And net ETF flows have been negative for six of the past seven days. Volatility may be here to stay Some analysts are predicting these types of extreme price fluctuations, Dogecoin and otherwise, are likely to persist over the coming weeks and months. Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain options platform Derive.xyz, told Decrypt he expects “this volatility to persist in the coming weeks as the global economy adjusts to a more turbulent environment.” Dawson put this down to “increasing pressure on the market as traders seek to reduce risk exposure amidst this growing volatility.” There is long-term optimism among some of the world’s largest investors, mixed in with expectations of short-term volatility. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders, didn’t rule out the possibility of the crypto market falling “another 20% from here” in a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. But the CEO said that the market turbulence presented "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Wall Street surges back but global picture remains fragile

Wall Street’s main indexes have bounced back from a heavy selloff, led by technology stocks, on hopes of the US opening up for negotiations on its aggressive tariffs. Most megacap and growth stocks gained, with Nvidia and Meta Platforms adding 5 per cent each and Tesla rising 4 per cent. The technology sector rose 3.5 per cent, while indexes tracking banks and semiconductor stocks were up 4 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively. The CBOE Volatility index – seen as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ – retreated to 38.59 points after rising on Monday to its highest level since August last year. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was trading 2.5 per cent higher after three sessions of heavy losses. “While today’s market bounce offers some relief, trade tensions remain the elephant in the room,” said Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM. “With Trump threatening a further 50 per cent tariff on China and Beijing refusing to back down, sentiment could turn quickly.” At 9.35am eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.11 per cent; the S&P 500 gained 3.16 per cent; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.65 per cent. [ China vows to ‘fight to the end’ in tariff war with USOpens in new window ] Since the reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2nd, concerns over a global trade war and fears of a recession in the US have gripped Wall Street, with the three major indexes hitting around one-year lows. The Nasdaq confirmed a bear market on Friday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow are down more than 15 per cent from their record-high closes. Uncertainty lingered after China said it will never accept the “blackmail nature” of the US to Trump’s threat to ratchet up tariffs on Chinese imports to more than 100 per cent. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview to CNBC on Tuesday tariff negotiations are the result of calls from other countries, not sliding financial markets, and China’s escalation is a big mistake. Meanwhile, Trump said he discussed tariffs, among others, in a “great” call with acting South Korean President Han Duck-soo. Worries that the aggressive US tariffs could spur inflation and hamper global growth have led to greater pricing of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Traders see more than 96 basis points of easing by the December, implying three fully priced in 25-bps cuts and a 84 per cent chance of a fourth such a reduction, according to LSEG data. A consumer price inflation reading is also due on Thursday, which could offer more clues on the inflation trajectory. Among individual stocks, chipmaker Broadcom advanced 7.4 per cent after the company said it was launching a new share buyback program of up to $10 billion. Health insurer UnitedHealth Group gained 7.6 per cent after the US announced 5.06 per cent increase in payment rates to private insurers for 2026 Medicare Advantage health plans. Humana soared 11.7 per cent, while Elevance Health also gained 6.5 per cent. CVS Health jumped 8.4 per cent. The insurer named UPS executive Brian Newman as its chief financial officer. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13.36-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 6.33-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded nine new highs and 24 new lows. Earlier, Asia stocks bounced off 1½ year lows, while European shares opened broadly higher. The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 1.4 per cent after falling for four consecutive sessions. The domestically focused midcap index also gained 2.5 per cent, after hitting its lowest point since November 2023 in the previous session. Japan’s blue-chip Nikkei stock index closed 6 per cent higher, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tasked with leading trade negotiations with Tokyo. – Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Big rebound in US stocks meets scepticism

NEW YORK - US stocks soared early on Tuesday after the biggest three-day rout in five years, fuelled by the most oversold conditions since the depths of the pandemic and optimism the Trump administration will water down its harsh tariff regime. The S&P 500 Index was up 3.34% as of 9.30am in New York, heading for its best day since November 2022. The cash index shed more than $5 trillion in three days, with Monday’s lows taking it more than 20% from its latest record. Rumours of a possible tariff delay sparked a massive rebound before the index found support at 5,000. Treasuries also reversed a rally, with the 10-year yield pushing back above 4%. “It’s a normal reflexive bounce you tend to see after plunging into oversold territory so quickly,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. “We’re in an environment of extreme volatility, and that counts both the downside and upside.” The Cboe Volatility Index soared past 50 Monday and was still near 40 early Tuesday, well above its long-term average. More than 29 billion shares exchanged hands in yesterday’s wild ride. While stocks looked set to recover some Tuesday, the S&P 500 Index still remains 15% off its Feb. 19 peak. The 14-day relative strength index sank to 23 Monday — its lowest since 2020 and well below levels that historically suggest the S&P 500 is ripe for a bounce. Tuesday’s relief rally has forced big-money speculators to unwind bearish bets in droves as oversold stocks recovered, leaving many scrambling to unwind short positions, according hedge-fund manager Jim Roppel, founder of Roppel Capital Management. “This rebound feels very much like a telltale sign of a short squeeze,” Roppel said by phone. “But things are so brutally oversold it makes perfect sense for stocks to rally.” Adding to optimism Tuesday were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said there is the potential for advantageous trade deals with major US trading partners. “I’ve seen the call list at the White House, and it’s substantial — we were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritise,” Bessent said on CNBC Tuesday. “You are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly.” China, however, was not among them, with Beijing saying late Monday it is prepared to “fight to the end”. Japan looks set to get priority in talks to roll back President Donald Trump’s duties, which are scheduled to kick in at 12.01am Wednesday Washington time. “The market is set up for a relief rally, while the ex-China headlines point to negotiations with Japan driving markets more than the retaliation risks with China and the European Union,” said Andrew Tyler, head of global market intelligence at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The chances of the stock market staging a tactical rebound have increased after the recent selloff, according to JPMorgan Chase trategists. Market technicians are monitoring The Arms Index, also called TRIN, an indicator that tracks the relationship between the number of stocks increasing or decreasing in price and the volume associated with those stocks. Readings below 0.5 suggest more demand for stocks and dictates how oversold the market is, while readings above 2.0 are a sign that investors are dumping equities and that stocks are overbought. On Monday, the index fell to 0.47, helping drive a short-term bounce for equities. After hedge funds sold global stocks last Thursday by the most since the first half of 2020, the group, along with long-only funds, were both net buyers Monday at $1.5 billion — the highest buy skew for hedge funds since January, according to Goldman Sachs. That comes after bets against the world’s largest exchange-traded fund — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) — climbed to the highest since December on Monday.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns NYC to fix crime, filth and schools — or lose even more companies
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/08/business/nyc-needs-to-fix-crime-filth-for-companies-to-stay-larry-fink/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T13:49:07Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock Inc., warned policymakers in New York City on Monday that crime, cleanliness and a shortage of quality schools have significantly undermined the city’s attractiveness to businesses. “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies,” the 72-year-old Fink said during a candid conversation hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” Fink, who first arrived in New York during the rough-and-tumble 1970s when it was plagued by an economic crisis and widespread urban decay, expressed deep frustration, saying: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” His investment firm, BlackRock, oversees assets totaling approximately $11.6 trillion and is headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards. Fink’s remarks were reported by Bloomberg News. Since late 2019, approximately 160 Wall Street firms, collectively managing nearly $1 trillion in assets, have moved their headquarters out of New York. The city has seen a significant reduction in drugstores, losing nearly 40% over the past decade, with 10% of closures occurring in 2024 alone. Major chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid have reduced their presence, citing factors such as rampant shoplifting and other crimes. Companies like Foot Locker have announced plans to move their headquarters from New York City to other states, aiming to reduce costs. Particularly troubling to Fink is the city’s regulatory environment. He urged lawmakers to reconsider the stringent “pay to play” rules that limit political contributions from individuals and firms conducting business in the city. In New York City, “pay-to-play” rules are a set of campaign finance regulations designed to prevent corruption and ensure transparency in government by limiting political contributions from individuals or companies that do business with the city. “In New York, because we’re so dominated by the financial services area, we are not able to do anything related to helping shape the narrative of this city,” Fink said. “This is one of the reasons why I think the city has been so harmed.” Despite Fink’s criticisms, recent data from the New York Police Department paints a more complex picture of crime in the Big Apple. In fact, the first quarter of 2025 saw substantial decreases in violent crimes, with murders falling by 34.4%, down to 63 incidents from 96 during the same period last year. Shootings also dropped by 23.1% — with incidents decreasing from 182 to 140, according to the NYPD. Moreover, crime on the city’s subway system — a key source of anxiety for many New Yorkers — declined by 18.1%, including zero murders reported during this period for the first time in seven years. Law enforcement officials attributed these improvements to precision policing strategies, emphasizing officer deployment to Violence Reduction Zones, where major crimes have decreased by approximately 25% compared to the previous year. Yet not all statistics reflect improvements, particularly when it comes to quality-of-life concerns in the city compared to the pre-COVID era. Certain crime categories have grown notably, raising concerns among residents. Major felony crimes have increased by 32.0%, including serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, and auto theft. Petty thefts at drugstores have increased by 37.4%, while quality-of-life offenses resulting in summonses, including public drinking and urination, have jumped by 37.7%, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. Rat sightings reported through the city’s 311 hotline have also surged by 48.7% compared to 2019, the news site found. Emergency services have faced their own challenges. Ambulance response times increased by 16%, reflecting delays for FDNY medics in reaching life-threatening situations. Similarly, the NYPD’s response times to active crimes have slowed dramatically by 55.1%, Bloomberg News found in its analysis. Perhaps the most alarming statistic involves public health: Deaths from unintentional drug overdoses have more than doubled, rising by 110.9%, highlighting a severe crisis requiring immediate attention from city leadership. The Post has sought comment from the mayor’s office. Advertisement

Title: The Broad Relevance Of Jamie Dimon’s 2025 Management Learnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelperegrine/2025/04/08/the-broad-relevance-of-jamie-dimons-2025-management-learnings/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T13:41:05Z

ByMichael Peregrine ByMichael Peregrine, Senior Contributor. Well written CEO letters can serve as a master class on practical leadership lessons. The best-written annual CEO letters typically offer value beyond the company’s investors, to senior leadership teams of companies across industry sectors. They provide information from financial results and projections, to important perspectives on the company’s mission, strategy, culture and decision-making process, among others. All of which can be fodder for consideration by officers and directors of other companies. Among the most popular of these letters have been those written annually by Warren Buffett (Berkshire/Hathaway); Larry Fink (Blackrock) and Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase). And it’s the 2025 version of Mr. Dimon’s annual letter that contains some particularly noteworthy musings on executive practices, under the letter’s heading, “Management Learnings”. They represent an edited version of a “master class” on management lessons he previously provided to his senior executive team, and comment on the need to nurture innovation, ambition and discipline while discouraging complacency, arrogance and bureaucracy: Complacency and Arrogance: Complacency (i.e., the arrogance of being slow to adjust) is cited as a leading cause of corporate failure. Caution is required when elements of complacency are identified, because complacency can lead to the negative developments “that kill companies”. Getting the Numbers Right: The value of proper accounting is cited as a key to corporate success; “to know your numbers: You need to get your numbers right, understand them, analyze them, work them, test them and don't be rote about it.” This includes using an actual budget as a barometer, comparing performance with the best companies, not the peer average, and pursuing a rigorous review of allocated expenses. Full and Constant Competitive Assessment: Great value can be gained from a full and constant assessment of the company’s competition, including organizations that are outside of the company’s immediate business sector. Much can be learned from competitors, customers and employees if leaders are open to recognizing the lessons. Example: Chick-fil-A using drones to figure out how to expedite the drive-thru line. Focus on Controls: Noting that “[H]onest numbers are critical to having great controls,” Mr. Dimon recommends making a practice of continually reviewing financial operational detail, project reporting and audit reports. He also encourages rigorous stress testing and risk management of new products, which “often tend to blow up.” Killing the Bureaucracy: Mr. Dimon describes bureaucracy as a weed that must be continuously gardened. Meetings are cited as a particular example; hold them only when necessary. There should be a purpose to every meeting, and they should conclude with a follow-up list. Avoid the risk of over-collaborating. Acknowledging Mistakes: Effective leaders will recognize that they don’t always get everything right-and when mistakes are made it’s important to acknowledge and learn from them. Among Mr. Dimon’s own, self-described mistakes: underestimating the importance of cloud technology; leaving the wrong person in a job for too long and failing to recognize certain early risk warnings. Defining Culture: Mr. Dimon cites “Ted Lasso” for offering lessons on the important contribution that recognition makes to effective corporate culture, “by recognizing people’s actions day in and day out ‒ not by serving up platitudes.” Recognition is a form of humility and acknowledgment that often directly aligns with corporate values. Team Leadership: Admonishing a colleague to “stay in your lane” can be the cause of major mistakes; i.e., what can occur when people identify something as a problem, but are reluctant to raise it in the right room, for fear of being provocative. “There's nothing wrong with disagreement. Ever.” Achieving Growth and Innovation: Companies that seek to foster growth through forward thinking will evaluate innovative ideas by testing and learning- not through rote analysis, which is often counterproductive to creativity. Management Tricks and Tools: this is essentially a “lighting round” of fascinating yet practical tools of the leadership trade: (i) treat everyone fairly and with respect-from clerks to CEOs; (ii) balance celebrating success with emphasizing negatives and the need for continuous improvement; (iii) write memos yourself-don’t let others write them for you; when you’re asked a question, make sure that you-not someone else-responds; (iv) always make follow-up lists (which, when you think about it, can be distinguished from “to-do” lists); (v) when you attend meetings, give them 100% of your attention; (vi) work smarter, not longer-don’t read the same email multiple times; and (vii) If you don't take care of yourself, it doesn't work. ***** Now that’s a lot of lessons. And to be sure, some may be more applicable to large companies in general, and to the financial services sector in particular, than to the broader commercial sector. But it’s hard not to take away some leadership nuggets from each of Mr. Dimon’s topics, regardless of the industry within someone works. It’s akin to the refrain we often hear from high school and college sports coaches, and how they’re able to apply the lessons they learn from their professional major league counterparts. Ultimately, it’s the same game, the same ball and the same playing field, no matter the level it’s played at. And the lessons are just as relevant.

April 08, 2025 09:38 ET | Source: WEEX Exchange WEEX Exchange SINGAPORE, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WEEX , a global digital asset trading platform, officially listed the AB/USDT trading pair on April 2, 2025. AB is a public blockchain infrastructure project committed to building a decentralized future. It provides efficient and secure foundational support for DApps and a wide range of digital assets. Its high-performance mainnet and cross-chain capabilities are key to enabling the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The project currently focuses on practical scenarios including DeFi, IoT, and enterprise services. Originally launched as Newton, AB completed its rebranding in February 2025, marking a strategic shift from early community economy exploration toward a new phase of blockchain infrastructure evolution. Real-world assets are rapidly becoming a key narrative within the global on-chain ecosystem. In late 2024, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. Treasury product, which has since become the largest of its kind by market capitalization. In early 2025, Circle announced the acquisition of RWA platform Hashnote and integrated it with its USDC-linked fund products, further advancing the convergence between stablecoins and real-world financial instruments. These developments reflect the accelerating global interest in on-chain RWAs. According to data from RWA.xyz, as of March 2025, the total value of RWAs locked on-chain has surpassed $18.6 billion, up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. The listing of AB represents another strategic step in WEEX’s commitment to blockchain infrastructure development. The platform continues to focus on supporting high-quality projects that facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets and enable cross-chain interoperability. AB’s long-term dedication to RWA use cases and its adoption of heterogeneous blockchain architecture align closely with WEEX’s mission to bridge real-world value and on-chain participation, offering users broader access to diversified digital assets. To mark the listing, WEEX has launched a limited-time deposit and spot trading promotion. Users who complete the designated tasks will be eligible to share in a total prize pool of 10,000 USDT.

Tariffs Liz Wolfe | 4.8.2025 9:30 AM The manufactured pause: Yesterday, news spread that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to its implementation of the most massive round of tariffs, currently set to go into effect tomorrow. The market started climbing back up as the news made the rounds and was relayed by CNBC and Reuters. The only trouble was that this was made up and amplified on X, with no bearing in reality. It looks like the posts came from an actual Fox News interview with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in which he was asked whether the president would "consider a 90-day pause in tariffs." Hassett replied: "The president is going to decide what the president is going to decide." ("I would urge everyone, especially Bill [Ackman], to ease off the rhetoric a little bit," he added. "It's the idea that it's going to be a 'nuclear winter' or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric.") Get your daily news roundup from Liz Wolfe and Reason. Δ An X post from "Hammer Capital" (handle: "yourfavorito") with about 1,000 followers appears to have originated the 90-day pause rumor circa 10:11 a.m. ET. "At about 10:12 a.m., CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, said that cheers had broken out, as stock indices—which were already recovering from early-morning lows—suddenly surged," reports CNN. "'Walter Bloomberg,' an account with a much larger following … copy-and-pasted the original rumor along with a siren emoji at 10:13 a.m." The recovery continued. CNBC and Reuters started circulating the news, having failed to corroborate. Meanwhile, Trump lackeys continued to make the rounds saying extraordinarily dumb things. Peter Navarro, senior White House trade adviser, guarantees no recession. Don't you feel so much better? Meanwhile, the Fox folks are having a blast with the chyrons and touting our return to manufacturing as the thing that will callus up the soft hands of American men, or whatever. Good thing the urban-core men stocked up on Carhartt; they'll need it on the assembly line. I give up. pic.twitter.com/F6TcH2ys0N — Scott Lincicome (@scottlincicome) April 7, 2025 Those inclined to give the administration the most possible credit, and to see 4D chess moves everywhere they look, have theorized that the Trump administration could be imposing such intense tariffs as a bargaining chip to actually bring about more free trade by persuading other countries to come to the negotiating table. This theory appears to be getting less believable by the day. Yesterday, the European Union said it would fully drop its tariffs on American cars and industrial goods if the U.S. would do the same; Navarro turned around and criticized the bloc for its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat exports, saying "You steal from the American people every which way is possible." Then he turned to Vietnam, which he accused of intellectual property theft and killing the American shrimp industry. "When they come to us and say, we'll go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us, because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters," he added. So the theory that this is all a ploy to get way freer trade than before does not look likely at all. Supreme Court says there's a jurisdiction issue: Last night, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to send deportees to prison in El Salvador, but did overturn a lower court's ruling, allowing the administration to continue such deportations for now as the lawyers for the migrants "should have…filed in Texas, where the Venezuelans are being held, rather than a court in Washington," per The New York Times. Make no mistake: This is a very narrow ruling. It's likely more will come soon. "All nine justices agreed that the Venezuelan migrants detained in the United States must receive advance notice and the opportunity to challenge their deportation before they could be removed, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a concurrence," per the Times. Trump is claiming the ruling as much more of a win than it is, loudly proclaiming that yesterday was "A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!" on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay, temporarily pausing a trial judge's attempt to force the administration to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States. This too should not be interpreted as a bigger thing than it is: He appears to be buying and biding time. BREAKING: Chief Justice Roberts has indefinitely blocked the court order requiring Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return tonight. https://t.co/yoeNMJnL8m pic.twitter.com/vx7k4IXIMV — Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) April 7, 2025 Scenes from New York: "Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker who is running for mayor, proposed on Monday a guaranteed basic income program that would be the largest of its kind in the United States," reports The New York Times. "It would aim to help more than 21,000 homeless children and young adults" giving "an initial one-time stipend of $2,500, followed by monthly payments over three years that start at $1,000 per month and then fall to $500 per month." This proposal would cost the city about $430 million over the course of two years. This isn't the first time Adams has tried this approach. On city council, she's spearheaded an effort to spend $1.5 million to support a nonprofit (the Bridge Project) that gives guaranteed income to new moms. But New York City already has a $4 billion budget for homelessness alleviation services; the problem really isn't lack of money. Peter Navarro said something quite revealing on CNBC today about BMW's factory in South Carolina: "That doesn't work for America. It's bad for our economics, it's bad for our national security." This piqued my interest. I grew up very close to that BMW facility -- the company's… pic.twitter.com/bDrjSzI3TV — John W Lettieri (@LettieriDC) April 7, 2025 The guy cheering on Trump's tariffs and telling stock investors to shut up about their losses is literally betting against Corporate America viz CDS. https://t.co/96iCUUQ5AP — Tracy Alloway (@tracyalloway) April 7, 2025 Start your day with Reason.

Title: BlackRock adds new Bitcoin custodian Anchorage Digital alongside Coinbase

BlackRock expands custodial framework for IBIT ETF with Anchorage Agreement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has expanded the custodial structure of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), formalizing Anchorage Digital Bank N.A. as an additional Bitcoin custodian through a new Master Custody Service Agreement. The development, disclosed in a Form 8-K filing dated April 7, 2025, introduces a secondary custodian while Coinbase continues to serve as the primary holder of the trust’s Bitcoin reserves. The agreement establishes a dual-custodian model between BlackRock Fund Advisors, the trust’s administrative trustee, and Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank. There will not be an immediate transfer of assets. Instead, Anchorage will remain on standby as a qualified custodian to support the trust’s risk mitigation protocols. Per the filing, Anchorage is required to utilize cold storage solutions for all private keys, maintain insurance coverage, and comply with provisions that address blockchain forks and indemnification responsibilities. This move is consistent with BlackRock’s positioning of the IBIT ETF as a scalable and resilient product. The presence of a second custodian does not alter the trust’s investment strategy or its underlying operational mechanics, but it introduces greater structural flexibility. The strategic addition of Anchorage may reflect BlackRock’s expectations of increased Bitcoin holdings within IBIT and the need for operational redundancy. Since its launch, IBIT has ranked among the top spot Bitcoin ETFs (and also ETFs overall) in terms of inflows, making risk diversification a logical extension of its custodial setup. Having Anchorage in reserve bolsters resilience against potential disruptions in custody services, whether operational, regulatory, or technical. The selection of Anchorage, a bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), further emphasizes a preference for institutions that meet federal banking standards. Anchorage is among the few crypto-native firms to receive a national trust bank charter, a factor that could enhance the trust’s compliance posture in a regulatory environment still shaping its treatment of digital asset custodians. While the addition of Anchorage introduces new operational options, no assets have yet been transferred. Coinbase remains fully responsible for current custodial functions, and the trust’s overall structure, fee arrangement, and investment objectives remain unchanged. The agreement’s role appears preparatory, building a custodial contingency plan without altering day-to-day fund administration. By preparing a framework for multi-custodian support, BlackRock signals a methodical approach to operational risk while positioning IBIT for long-term institutional participation. This development aligns with much of the community’s desire for diversification of custodial relationships as a baseline standard for fiduciary responsibility.

Title: 'They're not ready': Why BlackRock's Larry Fink is sticking around as CEO
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-fink-blackrock-ceo-succession-new-generation-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T13:24:57Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink is looking forward to the day he's no longer the CEO of BlackRock, but that's not happening just yet. Fink, the 72-year-old cofounder and the only CEO BlackRock has ever had, has long been answering questions about who will succeed him and Rob Kapito, the firm's president, at the $11.5 trillion asset management behemoth. "I look forward to the day when I'm not running it. I do not want to be somebody that's staying on longer than needed," Fink told the Economic Club of New York. The next generation team is in place, he said, but "they're not ready yet." He said that the firm's scale makes "the job harder" and that he "fundamentally believes" the team immediately below him and Kapito will take over in the future. The group of executives likely to succeed Fink includes Rob Goldstein, the firm's chief operating officer; Martin Small, the chief financial officer and global head of corporate strategy; Rachel Lord, the head of international; and Stephen Cohen, who was promoted to chief product officer last year. This lineup saw a shake-up earlier this year following the surprise exit of Mark Weidman, who, along with Goldstein, had been seen as a top contender to replace Fink. Weidman joined the Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial as its president on Monday. Salim Ramji, another executive considered a prospective successor, left BlackRock last January and joined Vanguard as its chief executive in July. Fink said he was proud of the BlackRock "diaspora," which has seen firm leaders take up CEO posts at other asset managers. Despite once opposing staying on as chairman — he said it would be a disaster in a 2017 interview — Fink said he's now open to staying close to help but likely not for long. Fink also touched on conditions in New York City, saying he used to believe working and living in the city was an honor and that his taxes were being put to good use, but because of crime, filth, and the declining quality of services, he said he "doesn't feel that way anymore." "You know, you're seeing more and more of your firm's population are asking, 'Can I move to other places?' because they're worried about the cost of housing here, the crime, the cost of education, all the things that are that are facing us." He said that BlackRock's New York employee base, with the exception of the acquisitions group, has remained at around 4,000 over the past seven years. He wants business leaders to "reclaim the glory of New York City." While he didn't name a mayoral candidate he was looking to back in the coming November election, Fink said he was a fan of Ritchie Torres, a congressman representing the Bronx who's expressed interest in a gubernatorial run. "He's not running for mayor, but he is one of the key members of Congress representing the Bronx who is really trying to make a difference," Fink said. Jump to

Title: Pro-Trump Billionaires Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

During the 2024 presidential election, many people warned that Donald Trump, a 78-year-old former reality TV star with an extensive track record of failed businesses, was not the person best equipped to handle the American economy. For some reason, billionaire Bill Ackman did not believe them. Instead, he endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign, going on to make very public vows of confidence in Trump’s leadership. Now, for his efforts, Ackman and others of his ilk have been rewarded with a very special prize: a cratering stock market and the worst economic downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. Ackman’s apparent regret has been on full display for the past 48 hours or so, as the billionaire has tweeted his way through the stock market’s increasingly dire collapse. “To state the obvious, it does not help our countryâs and our presidentâs negotiating position to be trying to strike deals while our market is collapsing,” the billionaire wrote flailingly on Sunday. “Whoever is recommending that idea to President @realDonaldTrump should be fired now.” Indeed, Ackman seems to have been under the delusion that Trump was only using the threat of tariffs to bring various nations to the negotiating table for trade deals. Since it has become apparent that Trump really doesn’t know or care whether he’s bluffing or not, Ackman’s tune has changed drastically, and he seems to be about two tweets away from a coronary. He is in good company. Lots of folks on Wall Street are freaking out right now, and other members of the billionaire class have come out to disavow the White House’s economic policy. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” Ackman worried on Sunday. “The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out, negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country.” Ackman went on: “If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.” The Financial Times reported Monday that Ackman’s primary investment fund, Pershing Square Holdings, has seen a 15 percent drop in shares this year. The fund’s holdings in “Nike, Mexican-style fast-food chain Chipotle, asset manager Brookfield and Alphabet have taken the biggest hits since the start of the year,” FT writes. https://t.co/tTxLfGaSdi pic.twitter.com/TrM2i2Si2k — Woke Putin ð (@ripplebrain) April 7, 2025 Other wealthy individuals and former Trump supporters have come out of the woodwork to criticize the administration’s tariff policy, which is largely credited for one of the most dramatic market downturns of the past fifty years. Elon Musk, Trump’s DOGE, has very quietly expressed concern over the tariff policies, while his brother, Kimbal Musk, has been more openly critical:Â “Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations. Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Musk brother recently posted on X. Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has made efforts to get into Trump’s good graces in recent months, has said that the tariffs could depress the stock market by another 20 percent. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we areÂ probably in a recession right now,” Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Billionaire Ken Fisher, who was once listed as one of Trump’s backers, also came out to blast the tariff policy this week, calling it “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools.” One would have to assume that there are other plutocrats who are currently kicking themselves over their previous support for Trump, as a new report claims that the world’s richest people (including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos) saw their net worth plunge by over $200 billion in the course of a day due to the tariffs. The sympathy they deserve is, of course, limited.

Good morning. Boomers told BI they are preparing for the worst as they worry about what cuts to the Social Security Administration could mean for their benefits and access to resources. "All I can do is cross my fingers and hope," one said. In today's big story, the markets briefly entered bear-market territory on Monday — a day that saw "fake news" trigger a $4 trillion swing in a matter of minutes. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was asked if he thinks a recession is coming. His response: We're in it. Tech: The market for face computers still isn't there — and could actually shrink this year. Business: One US sector could suffer big-time from Trump's punitive tariffs on Canada. But first, a near-miss for the markets. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A $4 trillion swing. An entry into bear-market territory. A new tariff threat. Yesterday was a wild day for Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell as much as 4.7% into the bear-market zone before briefly spiking on a tariff-suspension report the White House called "fake news." Roughly $4 trillion in market value was added to the index in 34 minutes because of the report. Then the "fake news" designation sent the market back down. The move demonstrated just how desperate investors were for relief from a relentless three-day stock rout. The S&P 500 ended the day above bear-market territory, but markets aren't out of the woods yet. The US and China could be heading for a long standoff in their trade war, risking collateral damage for economies and markets the world over, BI's Huileng Tan writes. On Monday, Trump hit China with a fresh threat of an additional 50% in tariffs — on top of a total 54% he announced since taking office — if Beijing doesn't withdraw the retaliatory tariffs it announced on Friday. Today, things intensified further. China's Commerce Ministry called Trump's latest threat "a mistake on top of a mistake." "If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end," said a ministry spokesperson. 1. Billionaires are turning on Trump over tariffs. The ultrawealthy were bullish on Trump around election season, but now they're souring on him after seeing trillions wiped from the stock market. They've seen their net worths plummet during the sell-off — and they've had enough. 2. Larry Fink says the recession might already be here. The BlackRock commander-in-chief said most CEOs in his orbit agree that we're "probably in a recession right now." But he doesn't think you should sell your stocks just yet. 3. Tesla's latest plunge has proved Trump's commerce secretary wrong. Last month, Howard Lutnick said a $235 share price was the lowest Tesla would ever go and that they'd "never be this cheap again." Shares on Monday dropped as low as $214. 1. The face-tech market just ain't happening. Big Tech companies like Apple and Meta keep betting on face computers like AR and VR goggles, even though customers don't seem to be interested. This year, the market for face tech might even shrink — but Meta's still optimistic. 2. A logistics giant is turning its warehouses into robot testing labs. GXO is betting big on the next frontier of physical AI, putting humanoid robots from three different firms to work in its warehouses. GXO's chief automation officer said the tech could theoretically complete multiple tasks in the future. 3. Trump tariffs are all about Taiwan. Tariffs are Trump's attempt to shift the global economy away from Chinese manufacturing. That's because Taiwan, home to TSMC, is at the heart of global supply chains. If China invades Taiwan, the economic shock could make last week look tame. 1. The next big loser in Trump's beef with Canada. Canadian investors have put some $184 billion in US commercial real estate over the last decade. Some are wealthy pension funds such as Oxford Properties Group, a partner in Hudson Yards. Trump's punitive tariffs are endangering the pipeline of steady Canadian cash to those projects. 2. The Okta CEO's hot take on the job market for software engineers. Even as AI shakes up the field, Todd McKinnon expects more demand for software engineers in the next five years, not less. Here's why. 3. DOGE's targets in its consultancy crackdown. From DEI to energy-related contracts, BI analyzed five government contracts DOGE has axed. It shows a major realignment in how the federal government is working with consultants.

Title: US consumers stockpile goods ahead of Trump’s new tariffs: ‘Preparing for the worst’

Pushing a shopping cart down the aisle of a Walmart Supercenter, Thomas Jennings, 53, loaded up on juices, condiments, and whatever he could think of. “I’m buying double of whatever – beans, canned goods, flour, you name it,” he said. His strategy is to stock up as much as possible before the Trump administration’s latest round of import tariffs takes effect on Wednesday. Earlier at Costco, Jennings bought flour, sugar, and water in bulk. “There’s a recession coming, and I am preparing for the worst,” he said. Like a growing number of U.S. shoppers, Jennings believes retail prices will soon rise because of Trump’s tariffs. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group, said the new levies will cost Americans $3.1 trillion over the next 10 years, amounting to a roughly $2,100 tax increase per household in 2025 alone. Even as many shoppers take a wait-and-see approach, some fear that any panic would trigger a stockpiling frenzy that intensifies on expectations of even worse inflation, they told Reuters. Manish Kapoor, founder of GCG, a supply chain management firm outside Los Angeles, said the tariffs are reawakening fears of empty store shelves encountered during the pandemic, when supply chain disruptions led to product shortages and inflation. “We saw this during COVID as well, where everybody frantically went and grabbed everything on store shelves, whether they needed it or not,” Kapoor said. “It’s not to that level, but people are worried that the cost (of goods) is going to go up and, you know, let’s stock up.” Walmart and Costco did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Angelo Barrio, 55, a retired garment industry professional, said Trump’s tactics of “muddying the water and causing chaos” have worried him and his friends about the economy’s direction. Barrio began buying goods with long shelf lives in November as he feared retailers would pass on tariff costs to their customers. At Costco this week, he stocked up on Crest toothpaste, soap, water, and rice to fill six canisters already stuffed with canned goods in his temperature-controlled basement. At Walmart, he grabbed two more bottles of olive oil, bringing his total stockpile to 20 bottles. “You can never be sure how much you’ll need,” he said. Barrio is sympathetic towards China, which Trump threatened on Monday with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs on the United States. “They are simply getting penalized for no fault of their own,” he said. “I have always been happy that they are able to provide us things at such low prices.” US stocks jump as trading partners rush to negotiate with Trump on tariffs Maggie Collins, who is in her mid-60s, said she is “shaking in my boots” as she worries about Trump’s tariffs and their impact on senior citizens. At a Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey, Collins filled her cart with items like shower gels and sanitary pads, favoring Walmart brands that are cheaper than those from Procter & Gamble and Unilever. “I look at all the prices closely because I live on a fixed income,” said Collins, a health aide at a senior living facility. “Paying a higher price somewhere means making adjustments to some other budget.” On a recent visit to Shoprite, where Collins bought chopped meat to cook for her grandchildren, her typical 3 lb (1.36 kg) meat purchase cost $16, forcing her to take the $8 version instead. How would the younger generation cope, she wondered. “They are just getting out into this world where it has become so tough to survive.” At Valley Subaru in Longmont, Colorado, business has spiked in recent weeks. General Sales Manager Nic Chuenchit said he was unsure how much of that was due to consumers’ concerns about the 25% tariffs, which took effect on fully imported cars on April 3. “Customers are talking about the tariffs; customers are asking us questions about them,” Chuenchit said. “I do think some of our customers who were planning to buy a car have done it sooner rather than later because of the talk about tariffs.” Chuenchit was optimistic as he recalled selling cars after the 2008 recession and during the pandemic. “This business is resilient. Car sales have always been there,” he said. “People will still buy cars, even if there are tariffs. It’s just going to cost consumers more.” Advertisement

Title: Forbes Daily: Markets’ Reprieve Proves To Be A Mirage Amid Tariff Saga

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The millions of people who rely on medical devices like hearing aids or insulin pumps could face higher prices due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Unlike pharmaceutical companies, medical device makers did not get a carveout from the levies. Some 40% of all devices are manufactured overseas, including in Mexico and Europe, which now face tariff rates of 25% and 20%, respectively. Even devices manufactured in the U.S. may require imported parts, which could be subject to tariffs. The CEO of one health system based near Seattle told Forbes its costs could go up $10 million to $25 million a year due to tariffs. “The healthcare supply chain is fragile,” says Erik Wexler, CEO of Providence. Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Stock markets experienced tariff whiplash Monday, ending the day mostly down after a whirlwind trading session. All three indexes fell dramatically at opening, but then reversed course after an unsubstantiated claim circulated on social media saying the White House would pause the tariffs for 90 days before the Trump Administration called it “fake news.” Bitcoin’s post-election gains were briefly erased Monday, as the token is one of several that has declined in value in recent days after Trump’s tariff announcement. The tariffs have wiped about $290 billion from the global crypto market’s aggregate capitalization since April 2, despite Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. The tariff saga continues, as Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China, and the European Union is reportedly considering a 25% import tax on some U.S. goods. The White House already imposed one of the harshest levies on China, at 34%, on top of a 20% tariff imposed earlier this year, meaning the tax would climb to 104% under Trump’s latest threat. Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images Denise Prenosil, the ex-wife of Dick’s Sporting Goods Chairman Ed Stack, is now one of the richest women in America, thanks to the company’s incredible post-pandemic run. Prenosil is worth an estimated $1 billion as shares of the sporting goods chain soared more than 850% over the past five years. The U.S. lags when it comes to privately financed infrastructure, but Michael Dorrell, CEO of infrastructure investment firm Stonepeak, has turned the market into a bonanza. Stonepeak manages a $72 billion infrastructure portfolio that includes wind farms, broadband service and fiber providers, and Forbes estimates Dorrell is now worth $8.5 billion. Photo by Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance via Getty Images The Supreme Court voted 5-4 to block a district court judge’s order barring the Trump Administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, but said that from now on, detainees under the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice that they are subject to removal and be given “a reasonable time” to challenge their deportation in the proper venue. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies threaten his gains from his social media venture: After announcing the plans last week, Trump’s stake in the parent company of Truth Social plummeted about $260 million to $1.9 billion. But Trump is still ahead, since he invested no money in the business at the outset, and it has a super-high valuation relative to its underlying financials. If you’ve looked at your retirement or brokerage account the last few days, it probably hurt. But the losses you’re seeing don’t translate for tax purposes unless you sold investments. To figure out the realized gain or loss, subtract the basis (how much you paid for an asset) from the sale price. ID Logistics French logistics company ID Logistics took a hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs last week, and its billionaire founder and CEO Eric Hémar lost $200 million. It’s no surprise given that ID is caught in the middle of the international showdown. ID—which manages the flow of goods in and out of warehouses for companies like Amazon and Inditex, packaging items before they’re shipped to consumers—is the leading logistics company in France, and also has a presence in 18 other countries. Approximately 70% of its $3.6 billion in revenue comes from outside of France, with the greatest share from Poland, followed by the U.S., then Spain and Portugal. But Hémar doesn’t appear to be rattled. When asked about the tariffs, he responded calmly. “My business is domestic,” he said, “Where I am directly concerned is that my business is sensitive to the economic climate.” But one analyst told Forbes that an economic downturn could encourage companies to outsource more of their logistics and drive more business to ID. The contract logistics industry barely existed a few decades ago, when most companies handled their own packaging and shipping. Now businesses are increasingly realizing they can save money by outsourcing those tasks. The industry is set to keep growing: BNP Paribas estimates that the contract logistics market in the U.S. is only 20% built out; the most mature market is the U.K., at just 60%. WHY IT MATTERS “Plenty of companies are already experiencing losses from Trump’s tariff war—but on the other side of this economic turmoil, there will also be some winners,” says Forbes reporter Monica Hunter-Hart. “One could be the French entrepreneur Eric Hémar, along with his company ID Logistics. His industry is set to expand if retailers, eager to find new ways to cut costs, start outsourcing more of their logistics.” MORE Despite Share Slide, Jeff Bezos And Amazon Look Likely To End Up Tariff Winners Analysts see turbulence ahead for the airline industry as tariffs weigh on consumer confidence.

Title: The Relentless Rise of Jensen Huang

How Jensen Huang built Nvidia into a nearly $3 trillion business Listen to more stories on hark Another day, another new AI large language model that’s supposedly better than all previous ones. When I began writing this story, Elon Musk’s xAI had just released Grok 3, which the company says performs better than its competitors against a wide range of benchmarks. As I was revising the article, Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which it says outperforms Grok 3. And by the time you read this, who knows? Maybe an entirely new LLM will have appeared. In January, after all, the AI world was temporarily rocked by the release of a low-cost, high-performance LLM from China called DeepSeek-R1. A month later, people were already wondering when DeepSeek-R2 would come out. Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. The competition among LLMs may be hard to keep track of, but for Nvidia, the company that designs the computer chips—or graphics-processing units (GPUs)—that many of these large language models have been trained on, it’s also enormously lucrative. Nvidia, which, as of this writing, is the third-most-valuable company in the world (after Apple and Microsoft), was started three decades ago by engineers who wanted to make graphics cards for gamers. How it evolved into the company that is providing almost all the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush is the story at the core of Stephen Witt’s The Thinking Machine. Framed as a biography of Jensen Huang, the only CEO Nvidia has ever had, the book is also something more interesting and revealing: a window onto the intellectual, cultural, and economic ecosystem that has led to the emergence of superpowerful AI. James Surowiecki: DeepSeek’s chatbot has an important message That ecosystem’s center, of course, is Silicon Valley, where Huang has spent most of his adult life. He was born in Taiwan, the son of a chemical engineer and a teacher. The family moved to Thailand when he was 5, and a few years later, his parents sent him and his older brother to the United States to escape political unrest. Eventually, his parents relocated to the U.S. as well, and Huang grew up in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. In the early 1980s, after majoring in electrical engineering at Oregon State (which at the time didn’t offer a computer-science major), he got a job at Advanced Micro Devices. The company—then the poor cousin of the chip giant Intel—was headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, near US 101, the highway that runs from San Jose to Stanford. Since then, Huang’s career has unfolded within a five-mile radius of that office. Huang soon left AMD for a firm called LSI Logic Corporation, which built software-design tools for chip architects, and then left LSI in 1993 to start Nvidia with the chip designers Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky: He was right on target “to run something by the age of thirty,” as he’d told them he aimed to do. The company was entering a crowded marketplace for developing graphics cards, the computer hardware that’s used to render images and videos. Nvidia didn’t have a real business plan, but Huang’s boss at LSI recommended him to Sequoia Capital. One of the Valley’s most important venture-capital firms, Sequoia helped the company get off the ground. The graphics-card business was built on a perpetual upgrade cycle that forced developers into a never-ending game of performance improvement: A company was only as good as its last card. At various points in those early years, Nvidia was one misstep away from bankruptcy, and its unofficial motto became “Our company is thirty days from going out of business.” One gets the impression that Huang liked it that way. He says his heart rate goes down under pressure, and to call him a relentless worker is to understate matters. “I should make sure that I’m sufficiently exhausted from working that no one can keep me up at night,” he once said. His reading diet features business books (which he devours). He has no obvious politics (or at least never discusses them). He’s not a gaudy philanthropist. Though devoted to his family, he’s also honest: “Lori,” he says of his wife, “did ninety percent of the parenting” of their two children. For the past 30 years, his life has clearly revolved around Nvidia. Huang’s reluctance to talk about himself makes him a challenging subject for Witt to bring to life. But Nvidia’s employees, who almost all refer to Huang by his first name, are effusive. They “worship him—I believe they would follow him out of the window of a skyscraper if he saw a market opportunity there,” Witt writes. He later adds that they see Huang “not just as a leader but as a prophet. Jensen was a prophet who made predictions about things. And then those things came true.” He has a ferocious temper—referred to in the company as “the Wrath of Huang”—and is notorious for publicly reprimanding, at length, workers who have made mistakes or failed to deliver. But he rarely fires people and, in fact, inspires intense devotion. One of his key subordinates says, “I’ve been afraid of Jensen sometimes. But I also know that he loves me.” Read: Jensen Huang is tech’s new alpha dog Huang’s greatest strength as a CEO has been his willingness to make big, risky bets when opportunities present themselves. The first of those came when he changed the architecture of Nvidia’s chips from serial processing to parallel processing. Witt calls this move “a radical gamble,” because up to that point, no company had been able to make selling parallel-processing chips a viable business. Serial computing is the way your computer’s central processing unit works: It executes one instruction at a time, very, very fast. Witt likens it to telling one delivery van to drop off packages in sequence. By contrast, “Nvidia’s parallel GPU acts more like a fleet of motorcycles spreading out across a city,” with the drivers delivering each package at roughly the same time. The coding required to make parallel processing work was much more complex, but if you could do it, you had access to enormous amounts of computing power. Initially, all that power was used mainly to make computer games look and perform better. But then Huang took another big risk, remaking Nvidia’s GPUs so that they could also process massive data sets, of the kind scientists might use. As one Nvidia executive puts it, “You have a video game card on one side, but it has a switch on it. So you flick that switch, and turn the card over, and suddenly the card becomes a supercomputer.” The fascinating thing about this decision was that Huang didn’t know who might want to buy a supercomputer in the guise of a graphics card, or how many such people were out there. He was just betting that if you make powerful tools available to people, they will find a use for them, and at a scale to justify the billions in investment. That use—and it was big—turned out to be artificial intelligence, in particular neural-network technology. As Witt notes, just as parallel processing was revolutionizing computing, a similar revolution was happening in AI research—though no one at Nvidia was paying attention to it. AI had gone through a series of boom-and-bust cycles as researchers tried different techniques, all of which ultimately failed. One of those methods was neural networks, which tried to mimic the human brain and allow the AI to evolve new rules of learning on its own. When you train these networks on massive databases of images and text, they can, over time, identify patterns and become smarter. Neural networks had long been peripheral, partly because they’re black boxes (you can’t explain how the AI is learning, or why it’s doing what it’s doing), and partly because the computing power required to make a high-performance neural network operate was out of reach. Parallel-processing GPUs changed all that. Suddenly, AI researchers, if they could write software well enough to get the most out of the chips, had access to sufficient computing power to allow neural networks to evolve at an extraordinary pace. In 2009, Geoff Hinton, one of the godfathers of AI research, told a conference of machine-learning experts to go buy Nvidia cards. And in 2012, one of Hinton’s students, Alex Krizhevsky, strung together two Nvidia GPUs and built and trained SuperVision (which he later renamed AlexNet). It was an AI model that could, for the first time, identify images with startling accuracy, largely because, in Witt’s words, “the GPU produced in half a minute what would have taken an Intel machine an hour and what would have taken biology a hundred thousand years.” Huang did not immediately recognize the importance of what had happened. When he spoke at Nvidia’s annual GPU Technology Conference in 2013, he never mentioned neural networks, talking instead about weather modeling and computer graphics. But a few months later, after an Nvidia researcher named Bryan Catanzaro made a direct pitch to him about the importance of AI, Huang had what Witt calls a “Damascene epiphany”: He placed another big bet, essentially transforming Nvidia from a graphics company into an AI company over the course of a weekend. This bet was less risky than his earlier ones, because even though Nvidia had competitors who also built GPUs, none of them had really designed theirs to be used as supercomputers. Still, going all in was prescient—developments such as large language models had yet to take off—and is what has turned Nvidia into a nearly $3 trillion company. Read: The lifeblood of the AI boom That weekend feels as if it were the compressed culmination of Nvidia’s story, which isn’t empirically true. The 12 years that followed have been incredibly eventful, and incredibly profitable, as the company has kept improving its chips, servicing the insatiable appetite for computing power created by the emergence of LLMs, and fending off competitors (many of whom are Nvidia’s customers, now building their own chips). But the foundations for that pivot, and all that ensued, were already in place when Huang decided to act on his AI insight. Those foundations, The Thinking Machine makes clear, were not laid by Nvidia alone. Indeed, among Witt’s key contributions is to show that Nvidia’s success can’t be understood apart from the culture and economy of Silicon Valley (and of tech more generally). Take the simple fact of free labor markets. One catalyst of the Valley’s success, as the scholar AnnaLee Saxenian has famously argued, was a freewheeling, risk-taking culture that encouraged workers to leave companies for competitors or to start their own firms. And that depended, in part, on the fact that noncompete clauses were unenforceable in California. Nvidia’s history exemplifies this: not just Huang’s mobility, but that of his early hires as well. Later, one of the company’s favorite tactics was to poach its competitors’ best engineers and coders—bad form, perhaps, but a good business tactic. Nvidia also benefited from the research investments made by the government and universities. One of the crucial breakthroughs in unlocking the power of parallel computing, for instance, was an open-source programming language called Brook, which a gamer and Stanford graduate student named Ian Buck developed with a group of researchers in 2003, relying on a Defense Department grant. Alex Krizhevsky and his partner Ilya Sutskever (who later helped start OpenAI) were grad students at the University of Toronto when Krizhevsky devised AlexNet. The contest in which the model demonstrated its accuracy, the ImageNet challenge, was designed by a Stanford computer scientist named Fei-Fei Li. And as that lineup demonstrates (Krizhevsky and Sutskever were born in the Soviet Union, Li in China), immigration has been central to the history of not just Nvidia but AI generally. Practical economic features of the ecosystem mattered as well. The most important was the rise of independent chip foundries: factories that serve many different companies and make chips on order. Nvidia’s partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the best-known of these factories, allowed it to become a dominant player by focusing on designing and writing software for its chips; Nvidia didn’t have to invest in actual production, which would have required prohibitive amounts of capital. From the September 2023 issue: Does Sam Altman know what he’s creating? Finally, Nvidia benefited from patience, and its board’s willingness to put long-term thinking ahead of short-term profits. Because of the gaming market, Nvidia was almost always a profitable company, but its stock price dropped nearly 90 percent two different times; it didn’t appreciate for a full 10 years after the dot-com bubble burst, while the company was spending billions turning its graphics cards into supercomputers. One familiar indictment of American capitalism is that it’s too short-term-focused. In the tech industry, at least, the trajectory of Nvidia (and many other companies) suggests that’s a bum rap. To be sure, Huang himself was central to Nvidia’s success: He has run the company essentially on his own (as Witt puts it, he has had “no right-hand man or woman, no majordomo, no second-in-command”), and he’s made the bold moves. What’s more, he seems to have done so without a trace of doubt. Lots of people in the AI industry—including the people training LLMs—have raised concerns about AI’s dangers, but Huang is not one of them. For him, Witt writes, “AI is a pure force for progress.” Huang does not fret that it may eat all of our jobs, or replace artists, or go rogue and decide to wipe out humanity. In fact, when Witt, stricken with existential anxiety about how AI will change the world, asks Huang whether some of these concerns might be worth pondering, he is subjected to one of his legendary tirades: You could write this off as an example of Upton Sinclair’s adage “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!” But the fact that Huang talks about AI in terms of its impact on “marginal costs” shouldn’t be reduced to mere opportunism: It fits right in with the single-minded focus on performance that has driven him from Nvidia’s beginning. Witt at one point calls Huang a “visionary inventor.” The vision Huang has been in thrall to, though, seems to be less about grand future goals, and more about tools—about making the fastest, most powerful chips as efficiently as possible. “Existential risk” has no place in that vision. Huang’s unapologetic stance on AI is bracing in its way, especially in contrast with the public hand-wringing of many AI chieftains, fretting about the dangers of their LLMs while continuing to develop them. But he is in effect making the biggest, riskiest bet ever—not just for Nvidia, but for all of us. Let’s hope he’s right.

Title: How Apple Stock Can Beat Trump's Tariffs

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SHANGHAI, CHINA - APRIL 7, 2025 - An flagship store of Apple Smart Products on Nanjing Road ... More Pedestrian Street in Shanghai, China on April 7, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Apple stock has fallen over 15% in the last two trading sessions after President Donald Trump announced a broad set of tariffs affecting more than 100 countries. These tariffs hit countries integral to Apple’s supply chain—namely China, Vietnam, and India. On the surface, this development appears to pose a serious challenge for Apple’s U.S. business. The iPhone—America’s top-selling device—and most other Apple products are manufactured overseas, making the company highly vulnerable to rising costs. In a worst-case scenario, Apple’s earnings could potentially decline by up to 30%. However, Apple likely has several ways to counter these effects, including price adjustments, stronger carrier collaborations, relocating production, and expanding its high-margin services segment. Also, learn how META might be impacted in META Stock To $200? What The Current Market Turmoil Means. Although it’s still uncertain how exactly these tariffs will be applied, here’s a rough worst-case scenario. Most iPhones sold in the U.S. are made in China, which is now subject to a 54% tariff. A Nikkei report from last year noted that the iPhone 16 Pro—expected to be the most popular model in the U.S.—costs Apple around $568 to produce. It retails for $1,000, providing an estimated gross margin of 43%. If tariffs raise the cost per device by over $300, the landed cost would increase to about $870, slashing the gross margin to just 13%. Apple’s Americas segment, which includes both North and Latin America, made up about 43% of total revenue last year. It’s reasonable to assume that the U.S. contributes between 25% and 30% of Apple’s total revenue. After excluding services revenue, which isn’t impacted by tariffs, roughly 20% to 25% of Apple’s income could face major margin pressure. Since other operating costs won’t drop alongside falling gross profits, the effect on net income and EPS could be even greater. A 25% to 30% hit to EPS is well within the realm of possibility. That said, Apple has several tools to help soften the blow. Raising iPhone Prices: Apple hasn’t changed the base price of its flagship iPhones in over seven years. The iPhone 16 Pro still retails for $1,000—identical to the iPhone X in 2017. Over that same period, the U.S. consumer price index has risen by about 29%. In light of this inflation, Apple could reasonably increase prices by $100 to $200 for the next iPhone without much customer pushback. Since U.S. pricing typically sets the tone globally, this could help improve margins worldwide. Partnering with Wireless Carriers: In recent years, U.S. wireless carriers have heavily subsidized iPhones to attract and retain users in an increasingly saturated market. Apple might collaborate with carriers to share the tariff burden, with carriers absorbing part of the price hike to stay competitive. Recent increases in wireless plan costs also give carriers more flexibility to offer better deals or financing options for iPhones. Increasing iPhone Production in Lower-Tariff Countries: At present, most iPhones sold in the U.S. are made in China, which now faces a steep 54% tariff. However, Apple has been scaling up production in India, which only incurs a 26% tariff. While India produced an estimated 14% of global iPhones last year, reports suggest Apple aims to raise that to 25% by 2025 and potentially up to 50% by 2027. Expediting this shift could help Apple protect its margins. Services Can Mitigate Impact: Apple’s services segment—not only its highest-margin division but also its fastest-growing—posted a 14% increase over the holiday quarter. In comparison, hardware only grew 1.5%. Services margins reached 75% in Q1 FY’25, compared to 39% for hardware. This segment has played a key role in lifting Apple’s overall margins, which climbed from 38% in FY’21 to 46% in Q1 FY’25. Continued expansion in services could help buffer the pressure on Apple’s U.S. hardware business. Apple stock may face continued pressure in the short term as more details unfold. The stakes are undeniably high. Amid economic uncertainty, ask yourself this: will you hold on to your Apple shares, or will you panic if the stock drops further? Holding onto a falling stock is never easy.

Title: Shopify's Toby Lütke doubles down on his hardcore 2025 messaging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-toby-lutke-efficiency-mandatory-messaging-internal-memo-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T06:45:41Z
Full Content:
Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke is going all in on hardcore tech messaging. In a memo to employees that he posted on X on Monday, Lütke wrote: "In a company growing 20-40% year over year, you must improve by at least that every year just to re-qualify." "This sounds daunting, but given the nature of the tools, this doesn't even sound terribly ambitious to me anymore," Lütke wrote, referring to artificial intelligence. The memo — titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation" — directed employees to ramp up their AI usage at the Canadian e-commerce firm. Lütke said using the technology is "now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify" and that AI usage would be gauged in performance and peer review questionnaires. He added that the expectations apply to himself and all executives as well. The CEO appears to be reversing his reputation as a founder who values work-life balance. Last month, in response to an X post that touted him as an example of balancing work and family, Lütke wrote: "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend. I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Lütke has since deleted most of his 2019 tweets, including one that said: "I've never worked through a night. The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so. I need 8ish hours of sleep a night. Same with everybody else, whether we admit it or not." In 2023, Lütke restricted Shopify employees from having side hustles, saying the company required their "unshared attention." The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The Shopify CEO's remarks reflect a broader cultural crackdown on Big Tech workers, who have enjoyed a work culture known for office perks, top-line pay, and job security, sometimes without grueling hours. Across the industry, free massages and football tables have been replaced with messaging around "efficiency" and "scrappiness and frugality." At tech giants like Amazon and TikTok, pandemic-era work-from-home luxuries have been replaced by strict return-to-office mandates. At nearly every company, layoffs have taken a wrecking ball to the industry and AI adoption has cut hiring, making job security a thing of the past. "We want to operate like the world's largest startup," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his RTO memo in September. "That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration." Workers who spoke to Business Insider said they are feeling the pressure to work longer hours, go beyond what is asked of them, be highly visible, and evaluate other options beyond full-time work.

Title: Thanks to the Trump tariffs, Framework has paused US sales of some laptops
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/thanks-to-the-trump-tariffs-framework-has-paused-us-sales-of-some-laptops/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T05:14:01Z

Framework recently announced that it is temporarily stopping the US sales of certain laptops, specifically the base Framework Laptop 13 (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U). The company, in an X post, cited the new tariffs that President Trump imposed just days ago, on April 5. Due to the new tariffs that came into effect on April 5th, we’re temporarily pausing US sales on a few base Framework Laptop 13 systems (Ultra 5 125H and Ryzen 5 7640U). For now, these models will be removed from our US site. We will continue to provide updates as we have them. When questioned about why it was pausing sales in the US, the company claimed that it priced its laptops when the import tariffs on Taiwan were 0%. Now that there's a baseline 10% tariff on all foreign-origin goods, the company says, "we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss," adding that it is not alone in this decision, as other manufacturers have taken similar measures but aren't open about it. The "reciprocal" tariffs that Trump introduced have hit the tech industry very hard. Many tech companies were notably affected: Tesla's stock fell by 43%, Nvidia's by 30%, Apple's by 27%, Alphabet's by 23%, Amazon's by 21%, Microsoft's by 16%, and Meta Platforms' by 14%. Nintendo's launch of the Switch 2 console coincided with the introduction of tariffs ranging from 34% to 49% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, where Nintendo sources components. Since Nintendo did not account for the tariffs in its pricing, this caused the company to pause US pre-orders to assess the impact of the tariffs. Framework and Nintendo are not the only companies affected by the tariffs. You can check out our report on how, thanks to Trump, you could be paying more for your next Samsung device since the South Korean tech giant does not have an assembly line in the US. And for your next iPhone, you could also be paying as much as $2,300, with the price possibly shooting up to the $30K to $100K range if all the components were made in the US.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Fundamental News and Triggers Risk-off mood triggers broad-based liquidation · Following the initial tariff pronouncements in the United States, investors thought that the worst of the uncertainty would pass. Instead, the reality has proven to be more severe. With tariffs exceeding forecasts and little indication of discussions, markets are rapidly pricing in the prospect of a worldwide recession, beginning with the United States. The risk-off mood has resulted in widespread liquidation across asset classes. Traditional safe havens like gold have not been spared. · Despite the short-term fear, the medium- to long-term outlook for gold remains favourable. The current climate, which is characterized by volatility, economic uncertainty, and central bank buying, tends to favour gold. · Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated the Fed’s “wait-and-see” approach to the emerging volatility last week. The announcement of the March CPI this week will be key. If inflation data continues to soften, it may bolster the case for further rate reduction, thus reigniting demand for gold. Technical Triggers · The gold active June contract has significant support at $3000 (~Rs 87000). However, if prices remain below $3000, they may fall below $2900 (~Rs 84500). · Silver has excellent support at $29 (about Rs 87000). I do not believe Silver can remain below this level. Every decline below $30 (~Rs 89000) should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of $32 (~Rs 94000). 1.

In my view, this final phase will give way to a sharp, euphoric rally that could mislead many into thinking stability has returned. While sentiment remains bearish, I foresee a surge in the S&P with potential upside targets of 6300–6700 over the next 6–8 months, marking what could be a classic blow-off top before a significant correction. This is a personal take based on current market signals, and while risks persist, I believe we’re on the cusp of a powerful, albeit temporary, upswing.” Bharat Electronics shares gained 3% on the NSE to ₹280.25 as at 11.11 am, after hitting a high of ₹288.

Economy ▶\Economic Update ▶\April 7, 2025 ▶\ The swift shift in global sentiment, high market volatility, and fear of US/global recession amid the tariff shock cement our conviction of a 25bps cut this week, with possible change in stance to ‘accommodative’ to give directional easing bias. The fluid global dynamics will require the RBI to be nimble in managing any risk of tighter financial conditions, especially as the shock to sentiment/capital flows is likely to require higher risk premia from EMs. While the extent of trade war pain is unclear, monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India. FY26 growth and inflation risk are skewed to the downside. However, we do not see RBI front-loading its ammunition, rather it may keep it ready for rain(ier) days. We will keep a lookout for any overhaul of the current liquidity framework in the near term and fiddle with non-conventional easing tools ahead apart from conventional easing, if the growth situation worsens or financial stability is disrupted. 1) Global uncertainty to dominate policy discussions Global sentiment has seen a shift and is rippling through the equity, bond, and FX markets in the thick of tariff shock and geopolitical concerns. Amid great policy and trade uncertainty, the overarching theme is increasing recessionary fears in the US and possibly even the global economy, led by macroeconomic shocks if these policies are sustained. Over this period, the Fed’s policy choices will become complicated with too many moving parts, as the US moves over time/swiftly from stagflation to recession. However, the eventual response will be counter-cyclical. Market pricing for Fed cuts has increased to five cuts from two, while market recession probability has crossed 60%. EM central banks, including the RBI, may follow suit eventually, but will also need to confront various push-and-pull factors via the financial market route, even with increasing easing biases. We believe the readiness of possible policy tools would dominate policy discussion within the MPC. 2) Liquidity management to remain swift amid global sell-off The tariff shock has increased our conviction that the RBI will cut 25bps this week, with further easing ahead. This could also be accompanied by a change in stance to ‘accommodative’ from ‘neutral’ to give directional easing bias. The aim would be to facilitate faster monetary policy transmission – something that the RBI has evidently displayed by the swift liquidity injection. System liquidity has swung from the super high deficit of Rs3.2trn in Jan-25 to a surplus of Rs800bn by end Mar-25. This has been partly helped by a durable liquidity injection of nearly Rs6trn in 4QFY25, followed by another round of Rs800bn OMO calendar in April. We see 1QFY26E to be in surplus liquidity, led by ~30% higher-than-budgeted RBI dividend and a sharp seasonal moderation in currency in circulation, albeit countered by i) continuous need for spot FX intervention amid tariff led volatility – May is historically poor for the rupee, and ii) maturity of RBI’s heavy forward net short FX book, unless rolled over. The RBI is likely to assure prompt actions amid any tightening in financial conditions. 3) India’s FY26 growth and inflation risk skewed to the downside It may be too early to consider actual forecast changes, but to state the obvious: risks to the RBI’s FY26 growth of 6.7% are materially downward. This will emanate from a much higher risk of a US/global recession if such global tariffs are maintained. The disinflationary impulse for Indian industry could emanate from lower global commodity prices/supply glut of goods. Asia has been hit much more than India on tariffs, and India is less export-exposed vs EM Asia, but is unlikely to be non-synced with EM Asia on the cyclical downturn. China’s survival response to the massive tariff blow will matter for India, amid its excess industrial capacity and dumping in the world/Asia. FX as a counter tool may be used by China, and will have FX implications for rest of Asia/India. 4) RBI to keep policy options handy amid global uncertainty The extent to which this global trade war could stretch is unclear. Monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India by being more countercyclical than fiscal this year. Implications for India could stem from both, global financial market disruptions and real sector hit. While there is scope for negotiation and de-escalation, we think this could be a pivotal turning point for EM assets in coming months, as the shock to sentiment/capital flows is likely to require higher risk premia. The RBI may not want to use all the ammunition too soon, given fluid global markets, and may thus not frontload cuts in April. Options like i) non-conventional easing in the form of easier regulatory (lending) norms, ii) lower daily CRR requirement for banks to sub 90%, ii) sterilized INR management, etc may be used, if needed. Near-term, however, there may be some overhaul of the liquidity framework in favor of daily VRRs instead of 14-day VRR, as the primary tool for easier ALM and liquidity management for banks. Gift Nifty’s 331-point jump comes after a sharp market sell-off yesterday, where India VIX spiked 66% to 22.79, reflecting a collapse in bullish sentiment amid global turmoil. The catalyst? Trump’s aggressive tariff stance, triggering fears of a full-blown trade war with China hiking tariffs to 34%. Until tensions cool, Nifty may face continued pressure. Traders are watching for the RBI’s potential 25bps rate cut on April 9th and corporate earnings led by TCS on April 10th. Key support for Nifty lies at 21,281. Meanwhile, bearish bets are on stocks like ADANI ENTERPRISES, OBEROI REALTY, and M&M, with Adani seen slipping from overbought zones.

Title: SSA reorg plan contemplates field office closures, contradicting public statements

Two people enter a Social Security Administration office in suburban Detroit. Jim West / UCG / Universal Images Group / Getty Images Stay Connected Erich Wagner and Natalie Alms Updated April 7 at 8:27 p.m. ET A draft plan for service delivery at the Social Security Administration includes “field office consolidation” as a goal for next year — even as the agency maintains publicly that it isn’t closing field offices. SSA posted Monday on X that it “is NOT permanently closing field offices. Only underutilized hearing office space has been closed and without permanently closing field offices.” But a plan circulating within the agency includes a goal to “further reduce footprint” in 2026 and beyond. The scope of the envisioned "consolidations" is unclear, though the document singles out field offices as on the chopping block next year. This comes after billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency posted information about nearly 50 field offices it was planning to shutter. SSA has said that news reports about plans to close field offices are incorrect. The draft plan, originally sent March 21 and obtained by Government Executive, is required by the Trump administration by April 14 as part of its push to gut the federal workforce and reorganize agencies. Asked for comment Monday, SSA spokeswoman Nicole Tiggemann wrote, "There is no validity to this claim." At the same time the agency is contemplating plans to shutter offices, it also is moving ahead with new identity proofing requirements expected to push more people to those offices. SSA is ending phone service for many of its benefits applications, as well as those looking to make changes to their direct deposit information, leaving them with online or in-person avenues to do so. Some regional leaders that oversee field offices still haven’t gotten guidance on implementing the changes, which are scheduled to take place next week, according to one current employee. SSA is also looking to shed thousands of employees. The March 21 document says that the agency plans to cut 5,500 employees by the end of the fiscal year as part of the agency’s plan to get down to 50,000 employees, as Government Executive previously reported. Martin O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during the final year of President Biden’s term, said that several elements of the plan, including further consolidations of the agency’s phone systems under Amazon Web Services and the development of a “digital service index” that elucidates which agency services can be conducted by phone, online or in-person, were already under discussion during his tenure. But none of it can be effectively done while reducing staff at the agency, which is already at a half-century low. “Except for the butchering of an agency that has already been reduced to a 50-year low in staffing, many of these things were things we had put into motion during my team, and some of it reflects the good work of the Office of Transformation ... A lot of those things should happen, but none will make up for the gutting the staff at this already depleted agency with a chainsaw,” he said. One operations component that formerly had about 400 feds now has only half that number, one current SSA employee told Government Executive. The office, a recent creation of what used to be two components, handles both operations support as well as some technology functions. “With the Regional offices gutted… no one will be left to support field offices when they have difficulty,” said the employee. Rich Couture, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees’ SSA General Committee, said he was alarmed to see the plan mention a hiring freeze at the agency, when Trump’s hiring freeze executive order specifically exempted employees who work on the delivery of Social Security benefits. He also noted that the reassignment of employees from regional and headquarters offices to frontline work constitutes a brain drain, both from those back-of-house components and from the frontline workforce. “From the union’s perspective, it made no sense to offer buyouts and early retirement to experienced frontline staff just to turn around and fill those vacancies with people who have no frontline experience, who will need months of training and years of on-the-job experience to become proficient in these complex programs,” Couture said. “And in order to train them, you need to take staff off the frontline to do so. It was an easily avoidable problem.” Couture said he too has heard concerns from frontline workers about the potential impact of the regional office consolidations and reassignments on the support employees in field offices and hearings offices need to do their jobs. “A lot of these components have positions that don’t make sense to put in a field office or a hearing office–you wouldn’t put an HR staffer into one of these offices, because it makes sense to have these staffed regionally and centrally,” he said. “One of the big concerns I’ve heard from employees of late is: What happens if all of these HR personnel are reassigned or RIFed and there’s not enough people to do the job, and then I decide at a later date that I want to retire or need to take some action with my insurance? That hasn’t been fleshed out yet.” SSA intends to push people online, the plan notes, by expanding what the public can do online with SSA, as opposed to going to an office in person or calling. Recently, however, people looking to reach the agency online have seen system outages as a result of new anti-fraud checks at the agency. The agency has also warned staff in its Office of the Chief Information Officer — which handles the agency's tech and is being led by a DOGE associate — of coming layoffs, calling the office's work "not mission critical,” one SSA employee told Government Executive. The agency says that it wants to ramp up the use of automation and artificial intelligence to handle calls. It hopes to use technology more broadly “to serve our increasing customer base with fewer employees,” the plan notes, including by fully automating the processing of most retirement and Medicare claims. O’Malley said the combination of increased anti-fraud measures–for an agency whose error rate is already under 1%–and funneling more people into online and AI-powered service lanes will crush the public’s faith in the agency. “There are things we could do to improve the level of customer service and ease of transaction for citizens and customers, but eliminating half the staff of the IT department is not one of those things and closing field offices is not one of those things,” he said. “Shutting down portals that had worked, whether online or via phone, to drive more people into the field offices–those are the things that actually destroy and degrade customer service, that appear designed to sour the public against the agency by cramming them into field offices.” Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the plans surrounding Medicare claims.

Title: India could be a key part of Apple's damage-control plan for tariffs

Apple’s (AAPL+15.02%) initial plan to take the edge off of President Donald Trump’s trade war includes sourcing more of its phones for the U.S. market from factories in India, according to the Wall Street Journal. Apple apparently sees this as a temporary measure to mitigate the blow from escalating tariffs; the company isn’t yet seeking to upend its entire supply chain over the news, according to the Journal’s unnamed sources. Apple’s stock has plunged about 17.5% since Tuesday, a day before the president blew up global trade norms by hiking taxes on nearly everything imported into the U.S. As part of the chaos, the U.S. announced 34% tariffs on China, and China responded likewise on Friday with 34% tariffs on the U.S. The stakes rose again Monday when Trump threatened an extra 50% tariff hike “if China does not withdraw” its aforementioned retaliatory tariffs. By comparison, the Trump administration slapped 26% tariffs on India last week. India’s government has indicated that it will not respond with retaliatory measures, per Bloomberg. Apple has long relied on factories in China to produce much of its iPhones, and as such, the company’s stock has fared worse lately than many of its Big Tech peers. While Meta (META+14.21%), for example, is indirectly vulnerable to tariffs through its impact on corporate advertising budgets, Apple’s entire business hinges on factories in countries with low wages and on parts sourced around the globe. Apple did not immediately respond when Quartz asked for details on its iPhone sourcing plans. Apple has shed 24.10% of its stock price in the past month, as analysts expect tariffs to substantially drive up iPhone price tags and ultimately undermine sales. UBS analysts, for example, think the tariffs could drive up the price of Apple’s costliest phone — the $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max — by $350, while the $999 iPhone 16 Pro could climb an additional $120.

Since Nov. 5, the largest cryptocurrency by market value has strengthened against the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of Nasdaq firms including top tech names like Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla. On Monday, one Bitcoin was worth around 1,993 shares of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which offers equal weight exposure to the group of tech firms. A year ago, one Bitcoin could’ve bought 1,756 of the exchange-traded fund’s shares, when it was worth $69,000. On Friday, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at asset manager VanEck, said the ratio had reached an all-time high on X, formerly known as Twitter. “[I’ve] been telling clients for years to use Bitcoin to hedge FAANG exposure,” he added, referring to a popular acronym for mega-cap tech stocks Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Bitcoin’s relative strength against Magnificent Seven stocks was at its highest level within the past year on Monday, rising 13.5% over the course of that period. Despite Bitcoin recently trading like a tech stock, some market participants viewed it as a sign of divergence. “In past market turmoil, Bitcoin has had a mixed track record of providing short-term protection,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “Is this the turning point when it starts to shine as a resilient short and long-term store of value?” As the president has pushed forward with his trade war, U.S. stocks have weathered their worst stretch since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell for a third straight day and has dropped 10% over the past week, per Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin’s price fell as low as $74,600 on Monday, setting a new low for Trump’s second term, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. While the S&P 500 has given up its post-election gains, Bitcoin is still changing hands above its Election Day price of $69,000 on Nov. 5. “Compared with historical macroeconomic shocks or crypto market cycles, these are not record-setting drawdowns,” Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist, told Decrypt. “The asset class has weathered worse and, historically, emerged stronger each time.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

April 07, 2025 16:43 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: Is Nvidia Stock Worth Buying The Dip?

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving ... More that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.&nbsp; You can buy Nvidia stock on the cheap right now, but should you? That’s the question many investors have been asking since the once-unstoppable NVDA stock fell to its lowest P/E ratio since early 2019. Get your answer now with this look at what happened to Nvidia, factors that could spark a rebound and risks ahead for the company. Nvidia stock gained 168% in the first 10 months of 2024 as investors bought up shares to get their piece of the AI boom. The stock price rally peaked in early November and then turned south when investors got nervous about lingering high interest rates. The negative trend for Nvidia deepened in 2025 as a series of headlines prompted many to question the chip designer’s growth outlook: January through early April, Nvidia stock is down almost 30%. The AI buildout has driven Nvidia's growth in recent years. Nvidia's AI data center sales are still increasing, but the pace has slowed and competition could become a factor soon. A full Nvidia rebound will likely require a different kind of breakthrough. Three opportunity areas to watch are robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving. Huang recently valued the opportunity in AI-powered robotics and automation at $50 trillion. The CEO says these technologies will "transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other industries." Nvidia has two platforms, Isaac and Cosmos, that support robotics and other types of physical AI. Nvidia’s GeForce Now service uses the cloud to upgrade the gaming experience on any PC. Gamers connect their PC gaming accounts at Steam, Epic Games Store or Ubisoft Connect to GeForce Now for added hardware support—essentially turning any device into a gaming PC. Nvidia announced expanded GeForce Now device support and capabilities at the 2025 CES trade show. Nvidia’s automotive line-up includes a platform for in-vehicle computing plus solutions for training AI driving models and simulating environments for testing. In 2025, the company announced automotive AI partnerships with Toyota, Aurora, Continental, GM, Gatik and Torc. Nvidia expects its automotive business to deliver fiscal 2026 revenue of $5 billion, up from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2025. Alongside these opportunities, Nvidia faces some challenges. Regulatory changes, cheaper AI solutions and in-house chip development top the list. Changing Trump administration policies could pressure Nvidia’s stock price. Reciprocal tariffs, even with semiconductors excluded, could raise input costs and reduce margins. While Huang seems unbothered by the trade war developments, he also said he could move manufacturing to the U.S. if needed. That is a long-term solution. Unfortunately, growth investors are not known for their patience. A transition to domestic manufacturing would impact the NVDA stock price. More concerning than tariffs is the potential for export bans to China and import bans by China. Reports indicate Trump has considered tighter limits on chip sales to China. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators are discouraging sales of Nvidia's H20 chip—a product designed for export to China—because it doesn't meet efficiency standards, according to the Financial Times. The rollout of DeepSeek caused angst for Nvidia shareholders. At issue was the $5.6 million total investment quoted by the AI app’s creator. The price tag seems tiny next to, say, Microsoft's $80 billion AI budget for fiscal 2025. The discrepancy prompted questions about Nvidia's growth outlook. If DeepSeek can do it, why can't big tech spend far less on Nvidia's AI hardware for the same results? Some experts have said the $5.6 million number from DeepSeek is misleading. Still, there will be a time when cost-efficiency enters the AI fray. That could create space for competitors to chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance. Big tech companies don’t want Nvidia to be the only AI chip game in town. It's too risky. They are mitigating that risk by developing in-house solutions. Alphabet (GOOG) recently introduced a collection of lightweight open-source AI models, Meta (META) is testing an AI chip and OpenAI has nearly finalized the design of its AI chip. These solutions will reduce Nvidia's business with existing customers over time. Nvidia will have to improve on performance and price as a result. Nvidia is an attractive, long-term buy right now despite regulatory and competitive challenges. The stock may not return to its pre-Trump growth rates, but it is an innovative, healthy company with a forward-thinking leader—and those qualities usually create shareholder value over time. Like many growth stocks, NVDA is volatile. Its per-share price can fall as quickly as it rises. You can see that dynamic in play for NVDA stock since it went public in 1999. So this stock is best suited for hardy, patient investors and those who already own NVDA and want to reduce their average cost basis. If you don't feel quite ready for NVDA, see this list of best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas. Bottom Line Nvidia is down nearly 30% this year as investors worry about tariffs, trade bans and lower-cost AI models. But the chip designer is not down for the count. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation. After the recent downturn, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is about 32. That compares favorably to other semiconductor companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Arm Holdings (ARM). Nvidia is a well-run company that can navigate financial downturns and industry shifts. Relative to its history, the company's current valuation is appealing. If you don't mind volatility and believe in the AI promise as well as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now is a good time to buy Nvidia stock. The biggest risks for Nvidia are margin degradation from tariffs, the global impact of tariffs, import and export bans and waning demand if others can replicate DeepSeek's low-power AI model.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving ... More that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.&nbsp; You can buy Nvidia stock on the cheap right now, but should you? That’s the question many investors have been asking since the once-unstoppable NVDA stock fell to its lowest P/E ratio since early 2019. Get your answer now with this look at what happened to Nvidia, factors that could spark a rebound and risks ahead for the company. Nvidia stock gained 168% in the first 10 months of 2024 as investors bought up shares to get their piece of the AI boom. The stock price rally peaked in early November and then turned south when investors got nervous about lingering high interest rates. The negative trend for Nvidia deepened in 2025 as a series of headlines prompted many to question the chip designer’s growth outlook: January through early April, Nvidia stock is down almost 30%. The AI buildout has driven Nvidia's growth in recent years. Nvidia's AI data center sales are still increasing, but the pace has slowed and competition could become a factor soon. A full Nvidia rebound will likely require a different kind of breakthrough. Three opportunity areas to watch are robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving. Huang recently valued the opportunity in AI-powered robotics and automation at $50 trillion. The CEO says these technologies will "transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other industries." Nvidia has two platforms, Isaac and Cosmos, that support robotics and other types of physical AI. Nvidia’s GeForce Now service uses the cloud to upgrade the gaming experience on any PC. Gamers connect their PC gaming accounts at Steam, Epic Games Store or Ubisoft Connect to GeForce Now for added hardware support—essentially turning any device into a gaming PC.

Title: ROSEN, SKILLED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Rocket Lab USA, Inc. Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action – RKLB

April 07, 2025 14:37 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: OpenAI Eyes a Mysterious Startup Backed By Sam Altman and Former Apple Designer Jony Ive

OpenAI is reportedly mulling a deal to buy io Products, a hardware startup looking to make an A.I. device, for up to $500 million, The Information reported. io Products, which took shape about two years ago, involves several notable tech figures, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple (AAPL) designer Jony Ive. It has also attracted the attention of Steve Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The startup took shape after Altman and Ive were introduced by AirBnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky, a close friend of Altman who has previously worked with Ive’s design studio LoveFrom, which Ive launched shortly after leaving Apple in 2019. Ive spent nearly three decades at Apple honing the company’s distinct sleek aesthetic. LoveFrom engineers, many of whom also formerly worked with Ive at Apple, are in charge of building io Products’ consumer device that could aid users in everyday tasks, according to The Information. OpenAI, meanwhile, is supplying the technology. The project’s current employees include the likes of Tang Tan, who previously led iPhone product design, and Evans Hankey, who formerly succeeded Ive to lead design efforts at Apple. It’s unclear whether Tan and Hankey would join OpenAI if a potential acquisition took place, noted The Information. What exactly io Products is working on remains a mystery. The venture has stayed silent on its plans for an A.I.-powered personal product, which could reportedly take the shape of a household device. One thing is for sure: it won’t be a traditional smartphone. “I don’t think you should try to do a better phone,” Altman told Axios of the project last year. io Products is backed by Ive himself and tech investors such as Emerson Collective, the investment firm founded Laurene Powell Jobs. As of last September, the startup was reportedly on track to raise up to $1 billion by the end of 2024. Since its rise into mainstream tech in 2022, OpenAI has made efforts to expand beyond just making A.I. models. In addition to exploring a potential web browser product that would compete with Google, the company is currently finalizing designs for its own in-house A.I. chips in a bid to reduce its dependency on Nvidia (NVDA). OpenAI is hoping to begin mass producing these chips at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) by next year. TSMC also manufactures chips for Nvidia and Apple.

Title: Warren Buffett’s decision to sit on $300B cash pile pays off — as 500 richest moguls lose half a trillion dollars
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/07/business/warren-buffetts-move-to-sell-stocks-pays-off-amid-tariffs-turmoil/
Time Published: 2025-04-07T18:19:25Z
Full Content:
Warren Buffett’s move last year to sell stocks and hoard some $300 billion in cash is looking prescient — as he’s the only mogul among the world’s 10 richest whose net worth has risen this year despite a market selloff triggered by President Trump’s tariffs. In a historic two-day rout last week, the world’s 500 wealthiest individuals have collectively lost more than half a trillion dollars, marking the steepest loss ever recorded on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Among the 10 richest people in the world, Buffett is the only on who has seen his net worth rise since Jan. 1. The Berkshire Hathaway boss’ wealth increased by $11.5 billion during that period. Buffett’s strategy insulated him and other Berkshire shareholders from the turmoil that has engulfed the markets in the wake of Trump’s surprise tariff announcement. From the opening bell on Thursday to Monday’s close, the S&P 500 sank 10.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plummeted 11.3%, triggering widespread losses among the ultra-wealthy. In total, more than $500 billion was wiped from their combined net worths, with Friday alone accounting for a staggering $329 billion — the largest single-day loss since the height of the COVID-19 market crash in 2020. Nearly 90% of the billionaires tracked by the index saw their fortunes shrink on Friday, with an average decline of 3.5%. Topping the list of losses was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth plunged $31 billion as Tesla shares tumbled over 10% on Friday. Musk lost an additional $4.4 billion on Monday — bringing his total losses accumulated over the last three trading days to an eye-watering $135 billion. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg wasn’t far behind, watching $27 billion evaporate from his fortune as Meta stock slumped nearly 14% over Thursday and Friday. The stock gained more than 2.28% on Monday — inflating Zuckerberg’s net worth by an additional $3 billion. In a year marked by soaring valuations and a frenzied stock market, Buffett chose caution over action. The legendary investor spent 2024 pulling back on stock purchases, paring down Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio and accumulating unprecedented levels of cash — signaling his deep skepticism about the price tags attached to both public companies and private businesses. Berkshire Hathaway ended the year with an enormous stash of cash and cash-equivalent assets — totaling $334 billion before liabilities. After subtracting $12.8 billion in payables for Treasury bill purchases, the figure still stood at a staggering $321 billion. That’s more than the market capitalization of Coca-Cola, one of Buffett’s most beloved long-term holdings. That cash pile now represents roughly one-third of Berkshire’s $1 trillion market value, underscoring just how reluctant Buffett was to buy in a market he clearly viewed as overheated. Instead of aggressively investing, Buffett and his team spent the year quietly offloading stocks — a dramatic shift from their previous posture. In 2024, Berkshire sold $143 billion worth of shares, more than triple the $41 billion sold in 2023, and over four times the $34 billion in 2022. After accounting for just $9 billion in stock purchases — down from $16.5 billion in 2023 and $68 billion in 2022 — Berkshire’s net stock sales for the year amounted to $134 billion. Even longtime holdings weren’t spared. Buffett trimmed positions in Apple and Bank of America — two of Berkshire’s largest investments. All this strategic repositioning came with an eye-popping tax bill. Berkshire paid $26.8 billion in corporate income tax to the IRS in 2024, which Buffett said was “the largest amount ever paid by any US company.” Advertisement

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: Effective Tariff Rate Hits 1909 Levels As Global Trade War Explodes

ByFrank Holmes ByFrank Holmes, Contributor. Trade protectionism by the United States of America by implementing tariffs Updated, Apr. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the name of President William Howard Taft. Ouch. Global markets are in freefall in response to President Donald Trump’s universal 10% tariff on all goods being imported into the U.S., with as many as 60 countries facing “reciprocal” tariffs on top of that. When we combine all new tariffs in 2025 so far, including the raft of reciprocal tariffs announced last Wednesday, we’re looking at an average effective rate of 22.5%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. That’s the highest such rate since 1909—the same year that President William Howard Taft proposed the idea of an income tax to Congress. Average effective tariff rate in the U.S. at highest level since 1909 As I pointed out to you last month, tariffs are a type of tax paid for by domestic import-export companies, who often pass the additional cost on to consumers. This can turbocharge domestic inflation. Tariffs can also lead to full-blown trade wars, as we saw in the federal government’s previous attempts to raise revenue through the taxation of imported goods. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, enacted in 1930, is widely believed to have exacerbated the effects of the Great Depression, as global trade tanked a whopping 65%. A few decades prior, then-Representative William McKinley’s tariff act triggered retaliation from other nations, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers. (If you need to brush up on your Smoot-Hawley history, I recommend the famous “Anyone? Anyone?” scene in 1986’s “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” which you can watch here.) As was the case then, we’re already seeing retaliatory tariffs. China announced today that it will impose a 34% duty on all goods imported from the U.S. If this weren’t enough, automobile imports face a steep 25% tariff. Trump claims he “couldn’t care less” if foreign manufacturers raise prices for U.S. consumers, and from the looks of it, they may need to—and significantly so, in some cases. Mitsubishi, for instance, will need to increase the price of its vehicles by more than 20% here in the U.S. to offset the new levy, according to estimates by CLSA. Price increase needed to offset a 25% U.S. tariff on autos The manufacturer expected to fare the best under this tariff regime is Tesla, whose supply chain is well-integrated in the U.S. More than 62% of the company’s facilities are located domestically, with approximately a quarter of its suppliers also based in the U.S., according to Bloomberg data. By comparison, fewer than half of Ford’s facilities worldwide are currently located in the U.S. This could be constructive for Tesla, whose stock has lost over half of its value since its peak in mid-December, making it one of the worst performers of the year so far. The carmaker’s quarterly sales fell a significant 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due mainly to political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. When it comes to new home purchases, bad economic news could be good news. Mortgage rates generally track the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 4% on Friday due to concerns about the trade war. Bond yields generally fall when prices rise. 10-year yield plunging on trade war fears Granted, home prices in the U.S. are still hovering near record highs, but current homeowners may be able to refinance sooner than expected. Lower yields are also good for gold. Because it’s a non-interest-bearing asset, gold starts to look more attractive as yields fall, especially when inflation remains historically elevated, as it is now. The 10-year yield is nominally 4.1% right now, but when you factor in the 2.8% headline inflation rate from February, the real yield is closer to 1.3%. If yields fall further or if inflation jumps higher due to tariffs, we may end up with negative real yields, which have historically been bullish for gold prices. The yellow metal is trading down as it’s swept up in the broader selloff, and I believe investors should strongly consider buying these dips. Gold just notched its best quarter since 1986, ending the March quarter at $3,123 per ounce, and there could be further upside momentum. Gold notched its best quarter since 1986 I believe the number one thing investors can do at this moment is to remain calm and not panic. Last week, I attended and spoke at the Oxford Club’s Investment U conference in Florida, where many presenters offered their own advice to those who may be worried right now, especially those nearing retirement age. Dr. Nomi Prins, founder of Prinsights Global, told the audience that now may not be the time to obsess over your 401(k). No need to check it every minute. My favorite piece of advice came from my friend Alexander Green, the chief investment strategist of the Oxford Club. Green reminded the audience of America’s exceptionalism, which is no less true today than it was before markets started crashing. “If we’re no different from other Western democracies,” Green said, “why were transformative companies like Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, Netflix, Snapchat, Instagram, Tesla, Uber, Crispr and NVIDIA—to name just a few—all found here?” Green is currently working on a book on America’s exceptionalism, which I’ll be sure to pick up once it’s released. You can read my two-part interview with him from 2017 here and here. Warren Buffett, the perennial optimist, has always urged investors to look beyond the current crisis and to follow the trendlines, not the headlines. In his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he wrote that “major declines” can “offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped by debt.” He also paraphrased lines from the British poet Rudyard Kipling’s famous poem “If,” which I’ll end with today: If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs… If you can wait and not be tired by waiting… If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim… If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you… Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.

Title: The bulls are in full retreat: These charts show the carnage on day 3 of a stunning market plunge.

The most reliable bulls on Wall Street are ringing the alarm bells as President Trump's tariffs plunge markets into chaos. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday, following the footsteps of the Nasdaq 100, which closed in bear territory on Friday. The three-day decline has grown to as much as 14%. These charts show just how painful the market implosion has been. The S&P 500 peaked at 6,144 on February 19, putting the bear market "line in the sand" for the benchmark index at about 4,915. The index hit an intraday low of 4,835 on Monday. What were the stock market's biggest winners over the past decade turned into the biggest losers so far this year. Year-to-date, Tesla is down 43%, Nvidia is down 30%, Apple is down 27%, Alphabet is down 23%, Amazon is down 21%, Microsoft is down 16%, and Meta Platforms is down 14%. The Hang Seng Index plunged 13.2% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since 1997. Investors aggressively sold shares on fear of an escalating trade war between the US and China. On Friday, China retaliated against the US with its own tariffs on US imports. Oil prices were already depressed over the last year, but the rollback of OPEC production cuts and fears of an economic slowdown have hammered US and global crude prices, with the commodity down 15% in three days. A potential recession would reduce demand for the commodity just as supply is increasing. Meanwhile, some of Wall Street's most enduring bulls have been forced to change their tunes as the sell-off ramps up. Here's what the three commentators have to say amid the market chaos: "If these tariffs (in current forms/rates) hold there is no debate… it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner… and we see no debate," Ives said in a note on Saturday. Ives has historically been an ardent tech bull, able to see the silver lining even in some of the most dire market scenarios over the last few years. But even for him, the trade war is hard to sugarcoat. "In one day this tariff policy if enacted will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs, major Cap-Ex delays due to uncertainty, and slow down US tech innovation… not a debate." "These reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit converted into some odd calculation) implemented would cause an economic Armageddon and stop the US tech world in its tracks...and wipe out a bright future ahead in one global policy mistake that will reverse US tech dominance in our view." "The resulting market fury is not due to a reaction to a trade war, but rather, in our view, the fact the White House broke a core covenant of capitalism — stable and predictable regulatory environment," Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Sunday. "The White House's sudden and aggressive executive orders left companies without the predictability they need to recoup capital investments, prompting vocal corporate backlash." Lee has often used stock market declines as moments to highlight opportunities for investors, but not this time. He highlighted the pain set to hit companies like Apple, which Lee noted is facing a 54% increase in production costs as a result of the tariffs on China. The result would be effectively nationalizing a third of its assets by redirecting its gross margins into tariff revenues." "On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN interview with Peter Navarro. The President's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same," Ed Yardeni said in a note on Saturday. "I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Wall Street matters a great deal to Main Street. Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0." "The President wasn't negotiating trade deals this weekend. He was too busy relaxing on the links." Jump to

Title: Vaio is advertising ‘tariff free’ laptop prices for a limited time

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Unless you’re a real stickler for the finer points of the consumer tech industry, you might not know the history of the Vaio laptop series. But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump administration’s massive tariffs, you’d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few “tariff free” laptops. To address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business about a decade ago. It’s currently majority-owned by Japanese retailer Nojima. At the moment, Vaio offers three different series—the SX, SX-R, and FS—in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. The designs are unremarkable and don’t often get spotted even on big retailers, but it looks like they’re getting some love from Costco as a US sales partner. According to Tom’s Hardware, the Vaio brand sent out emails to some customers hoping to lure them in with “Tariff Free Inventory.” While it doesn’t go into specifics, this is undoubtedly a reference to US president Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs on nearly every country that supplies finished goods and raw materials to the United States. This sent stock prices and other economic indicators into a tailspin, in what’s already being referred to as “the 2025 stock market crash.” For the Japanese Vaio brand, which manufactures all its current models in a Nagano factory, the relevant tariff is the 24 percent tax on products from Japan, according to Reuters. Depending on how the tariffs are implemented on specific components, the 34 percent tax on goods from China and 32 percent tax on goods from Taiwan may also come into play for laptops sold in the US. In the best-case scenario, Vaio’s cheapest laptop at the moment will jump from $1,100 to $1,364, assuming Vaio passes the cost directly onto retailers and final buyers. For the SX-R mentioned in the “tariff free” email, the starting price would jump from $2,200 to $2,728 for the same model. For more estimations on how tariffs will affect consumer electronics prices, check out this breakdown. The prices on the Vaio website as of April 7th don’t seem to have changed much since January, as seen on the Internet Archive. It seems like a safe assumption that Vaio is promoting prices for current inventory held within the United States, which can be sold at today’s prices without fear of tariffs affecting profitability. It’ll be a few weeks before the latest round of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the United States start impacting finished items being sold to consumers. If you’re in the market for a new laptop in the US, you might want to look for one right away. As Vaio demonstrates, there’s only a limited amount of computers in current supply line that can be sold at pre-Trump prices.

Title: Even Realities G1 review: Limited but effective smart glasses

I appreciate devices that don’t try to do too much. There are too many products throwing too many features at the consumer in the hope one or two sticks. I’m reminded of the recently revived Pebble, which offers a pared down way to check your phone’s notifications from your wrist, and little else. That’s the best way to describe Even Realities’ G1 smart glasses, which puts a second screen for your smartphone on your face. G1 is almost aggressively low-tech, putting in your line of sight a dot matrix display that’ll leap into life when required. You’ll be able to see the time, phone notifications, calendar, stock and news updates from a handful of chosen publishers. Tap the temple tips (also known as earpieces) and you’ll be able to speak to an AI to answer questions or dictate a note without touching your phone at all. Open the app to activate heads-up turn-by-turn directions, access real-time translation and use the glasses as a portable teleprompter. On devices like this, the limited feature set goes hand-in-hand with lowered expectations: If it promises the basics and delivers them, all good, right? Problems arise when it fails to do them well, or if it’s obvious to anyone there are features that would work here but have been omitted. The G1 doesn't stumble on the essentials, but I do find myself flip-flopping about how much praise they should get. They’re useful right now, but I’d love to see how much better they’ll get in a year or two. Until the laws of physics change quite dramatically, smart glasses will always be noticeably bigger and heavier than their siblings. But the G1 is hardly an embarrassment in those stakes, and while chunky, they’re not comically oversized. The frame is built from magnesium and titanium alloy and weighs in at 44 grams. That’s more than the 26 grams my regular glasses weigh, but not to such an extent that it’s burdensome. It’s no surprise to learn some of the company’s leadership team came from the glasses industry, including stints at high-end eyewear brand Lindberg and Mykita. Each lens houses a rectangular waveguide with a 25-degree field of view displaying a 640 x 200 20Hz dot matrix green monochrome screen. It brings to mind the old workstation terminals from the early 1990s. This isn’t shameless hipsterism, since green is more easily seen by the eye, and it also reduces the display’s power consumption, which is useful since the maximum brightness is 1,000 nits, and you’ll need all of it to see your screen on a bright day. Much of the hardware is housed in the temple tips — the bits sitting behind your ears, if you’re not au fait with glasses terminology. These chunky boxes include the wireless charging gear, 160mAh battery, Bluetooth LE 5.2 radio and the touch control sensors. As for the rest, the projector and microphones are housed in the end pieces (the hinges on the frame), and that’s it. There’s no camera, speakers, headphones, bone conduction audio or any touch surface along the arms themselves, because the makers expect you to have your own camera and audio gear. In the box, you’ll get the glasses and USB-C charging case, the latter of which has its own 2,000mAh battery which the company says will charge your glasses two and a half times before you need to head back to a socket. You can also get a pair of clip-on sunglass lenses for your specs to ensure you can wear them outdoors. I had initially presumed, given the heft of the original investment, that the clip-on glasses were thrown in but no, they’ll set you back an additional $100 in the US, €100 in Europe or £85 in the UK. Glasses need to be up to the challenge of withstanding the same conditions the rest of your head is exposed to. Even Realities says the G1 can resist a “splash" or "light rain,” but doesn’t include a specific IP rating, so you may need to baby them a little. There is only one size of the G1 available, and the company says it’ll suit anyone with a pupillary distance between 54 and 80. The temples can be adjusted to go looser or tighter, depending on the unique topography of your skull. But the frames are fairly stylish, and if you prefer the rounded “Panto” style of glasses, or a squarer one, you can opt for the B1 model instead. Naturally, glasses aren’t a one-and-done deal, with most folks changing their prescriptions on a bi-annual basis. Even Realities says that you should be able to send your glasses back to HQ when your eyesight changes, along with your updated prescription, for up-to-date lenses. In the EU that’ll cost €230, or if you’re further abroad, €240 ($260). I’ve deliberately not referred to the G1 as a pair of augmented reality glasses because I don’t think they fit the description. The dictionary says AR is anything that puts a digital view in front of the real world, but that’s too broad a definition. After all, if I held a paper map in my line of sight I wouldn’t be augmenting my reality as the map doesn’t engage with its environment. And it’s the same thing here — just because the display in question is transparent doesn’t, for me, move the needle enough for it to be classified as AR. Charge the glasses, download the app and you’ll walk through the brief setup and tutorial process. Software updates take around five minutes each time, surprisingly long given the low-tech nature of the system. Put the glasses on and you’ll notice the waveguide prisms add a slight tint to whatever you’re looking at. For instance, when staring at a white page on my computer, the prism adds a hint of gold that’s noticeable compared to the white around it. The glasses are deactivated by default, behaving like any regular pair of specs as you go about your day. If you want to look up at the dashboard, which is your home screen, you’ll need to tilt your head up. This is the first thing you’ll define in the settings: How far you need to move your head up to trigger the dashboard. I found I had to tweak it regularly, given my head naturally drift upwards more often when I'm, say, relaxing against the sofa versus standing at my desk. The dashboard is the first sign the G1 has some limitations. You only have three layout options for what you can see, one of which is the Status Pane, which is always on. Status shows you the time, date, temperature, a notification indicator and (when required) low battery warnings. You can add one widget or two, but if you pick two, one of those widgets will default to your calendar. The other widgets include News, Stocks, QuickNotes or a Map. News, Stocks and Maps feel like the default options you get with every gadget while its makers work out what its users really want and need. The news feed pulls from a handful of outlets and you can select from which categories (Politics, Science, Sports and the like) you want to see. The map view gives you a little peek at your location to the nearest 25, 50 or 100 meters, which I’m sure is helpful for some folks, like delivery drivers. But I’m not sure there are many folks who want or need to have this information so immediately at hand. Notifications You’ll be able to gatekeep which apps you can permit to be put through to your glasses, and when you get a message, a speech bubble will pop up on your blank display. When it appears, you can just flick your head up to see the message, or tap the temple tip while in Dashboard. It’s the same limited message you would get with any basic wearable connected to your iPhone. The obvious benefit is removing the need for you to get your phone out of your pocket or look at your wrist. On a Saturday jaunt into the city, several of my group chats sprung into life and I was able to keep abreast of the conversation without having to look at my phone. That was a real benefit, as I’d have been frustrated if I’d have had to check my pocket on the regular for messages that didn’t entirely concern me. The only downside is that you can’t do anything with the messages, like respond to them, unless you do finally succumb to your phone. Teleprompt, Transcribe and QuickNote Even if you’re comfortable speaking off the cuff, using the G1 as a teleprompter is a staggeringly good idea. As soon as I started using it, I was thinking they would be great for shooting review videos, as well as giving presentations and acting. Hell, I’ve recited the Gettysburg Address a few too many times in the last week. The glasses will also offer a way to turn what it’s hearing into text, either with the dedicated Transcription setup, or the QuickNote action. For the latter, all you need to do is touch a temple tip and you can then speak, with the system picking up your words and turning them into text. You’ll then be able to read the note, and play back the audio recording in the app, although you can only share the text of what you’ve said. It’s perhaps a lot more pertinent to journalists than other folks but the ability to have such easy access to a tool like this is exciting. Translation The G1s presently support real-time translation of 24 languages, including the major European languages, Arabic, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. After you open the app, select the language in question and activate the feature, you’ll get a translation two or three seconds later when someone talks to you. I’ve tested the feature with native French and Turkish speakers and while the translations did at times miss a word, the overall sentiment was well conveyed. Without a doubt, this is one of the glasses’ most eye-catching and useful features, since it subtitles the real world. But while the idea and implementation is all there, it’s not as sci-fi perfect as it could or should be, and that’s a problem. For a start, there’s the obvious moment you have to wait for while the system translates what your counterpart has said. Then there’s the fact it’ll translate anything it can hear, so when I asked my Turkish friend to speak to me, and then I read out the translation in English, the glasses tried to translate my response back into English. Everything’s far more reliant on the app than it could be — you can’t activate the feature or swap languages without having the phone in your hand. If you were able to switch the options around with a tap on the touch sensor, you could theoretically have a conversation just with the glasses. But as soon as you need the phone in your hand, it’s easier to just open up Google Translate and harness the power of conversation mode. Navigation The ability to project basic information in your line of sight is enormously helpful when it comes to navigation. After all, if you’re wandering around unfamiliar streets, then you probably don’t want to appear to look like you’re lost. Certainly, the spate of phone thefts where well-prepared poachers snatch devices from people’s hands is a sign of that. Much like every other feature, you’ll start by opening the app, activating the navigation pane and setting your destination. You can pick walking or cycling directions, and you’ll get a turn-by-turn layout on the phone as well as in the glasses. Once the route has been calculated, which will take a second, you can put the phone in your pocket and start moving around. On the left, you’ll get the road name, an arrow for your direction and the distance in meters before the next move. In the middle, you’ll get the projected journey time and distance, and on the right a mini-map showing you the route. Look up (triggering the Dashboard) and you’ll get a full sized route map showing your progress as well as an indication of your speed. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t adore this feature and would love to test it out while roaming an unfamiliar city, because it’s supremely effortless. Even AI Rounding out the spec list is Even AI which, at the tap of the left temple tip, will be available for you to ask questions. Even AI is essentially just an interaction layer for either Perplexity, which is the default AI client, or ChatGPT. Press the button and you’ll be able to ask it questions, the answers of which will then be displayed in your field of view. If you have a beginner’s knowledge of AI, by which I mean a fundamental distrust of anything it says, then this might be useful. Defining words, answering basic questions like “Who is Florence Nightingale” and looking up facts like the price of Bitcoin are all easily done. But that’s all, I think, I’d trust any AI to do, given how generally incapable of providing useful information it is. Controls There are two buttons, one on each temple tip, which will let you engage EvenAI or QuickNotes and scroll through notifications. Two buttons, however, even with the ability to accept multiple taps, is a little too few input mechanisms for a device this sophisticated. I keep thinking about the ways you can control true wireless headphones with all of that rhythmic tapping and that’s just for audio playback. It means you’ll be relying on your phone a lot more than you may like, and while it’s not a deal breaker, it is an issue. After all, if these glasses offer a way of spending more time engaging with the world around me, then I don’t want to be constantly snatching up my phone. I imagine this is another area that, as the software develops and more commands can be incorporated into the buttons, things will get easier. But it is, for now, a fairly significant frustration. I’d consider myself a fairly heavy user, and I would regularly get a day and a half’s worth of life from the G1 glasses before needing a recharge. It’s vexing in the extreme that the glasses don’t have an off switch, so they’ll be draining an admittedly small amount of power when not in use. I suspect, if I was living with these full time, I’d get into the habit of keeping them in their charging cradle on the nightstand while in bed to avoid any inadvertent losses of power while out and about. Even Realities’ G1 is available in two different frame styles: The G1A with the “panto” round-rim style and the G1B, with a rectangular frame. If I’m honest, I’d have preferred to test the G1B, which is more in keeping with my regular glasses preference, but c’est la vie. The glasses on their own cost $599, with corrective lenses costing you an extra $150 and the sunglass clip an additional $100. It puts these glasses in the same sort of territory as the highest-end designer frames you can get at LensCrafters. I’m not sure there’s a mainstream competitor sitting in exactly the same category as the G1. There are similar headsets, like TCL’s RayNeo, but that has a far higher resolution display since it promises real AR. The Frame by Brilliant Labs, perhaps, but that only has a display in one lens and relies far more upon AI to operate. Captify’s glasses use binocular vision but are only designed to offer real-time captioning for users with hearing loss. Vuzix’s Z100 only has the display in one lens and, as far as I understand it, Meizu’s Myvu glasses are only available in eastern countries. Which means, for now, Even Realities is your one stop for a product like this. And while they’re not in the same category at all, it feels negligent to not even mention Meta and Ray-Ban’s Wayfarers. The retail price may be cheaper but, once you’ve added prescription lenses they’ll set you back around $600, putting them close to the G1. But they’re obviously a very different product, with no heads-up display and a greater emphasis on AI and photography. I really like Even Realities’ G1 for what they can do right now, but I’m also hopeful that it’ll get far more useful in the future. It seems to me there are so many things that could be tweaked, primped and plumped to make these far more appealing. I’d love to be able to switch the translation mode with a press of the temple tip, so I could get a translation of what’s said, flip it to translate my English to the other language and then say it back to them so we could actually have a(n admittedly stilted) conversation. Adding reminders and other options to the dashboard would make it a lot more desirable to use. Hell, imagine a future dashboard update that pulls your step count from your phone so you can see how well you’re moving. Not to mention the ability to offer some form of real-time captioning for users who may have hearing issues. I’m not going to judge the G1 on its potential but for what it offers now, and what it offers now is plenty good enough. The biggest obstacle is the price, but what can you expect for a first generation product in a niche category? When speaking to friends about them, many said if the price wasn’t that much more than a regular pair of glasses, they’d struggle to say no to what’s on offer here. And I agree, once you’ve had a taste of the functionality that’s on show here, it’s hard to go back to normal.

After some time away, the head of UiPath is placing a big bet on agentic AI being the future of automation. by Nilay Patel After some time away, the head of UiPath is placing a big bet on agentic AI being the future of automation. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Daniel Dines, the cofounder and, once again, the CEO of UiPath, a software company that specializes in something called robotic process automation (RPA). We’ve been featuring a lot of what I like to call full-circle Decoder guests on the show lately, and Daniel is a perfect example. He was first on Decoder back in 2022, right before he moved to a co-CEO arrangement with Rob Enslin, a Google Cloud executive brought on to help steer UiPath after it went public. In January of last year, Daniel stepped down to become chief innovation officer and Rob stepped up to become sole CEO — and then, less than six months later, Rob resigned, and Daniel took his job as sole CEO back. Founders stepping aside for outside CEOs and then returning as CEO later on is quite a trope in the tech world, and Daniel and I spent a while pulling his version of that story apart. He made some pretty key decisions along the way to relinquishing control of the company he founded — and then some equally important decisions when coming back. If you’re a Decoder listener, you know I’m fascinated by the middle part of these stories that usually gets glossed over, so we really dug in here. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! But there’s a lot more going on with UiPath than C-suite shuffles — the company was founded to sell automation software. That entire market is being upended by AI, particularly agentic AI, which is supposed to click around on the internet and do things for you. The main technology UiPath has been selling for years now is RPA, which has been around since the early 2000s. It aims to solve a pretty big problem that a lot of organizations have. Let’s say you run a hospital with ancient billing software. You could spend millions upgrading that software and the computers it runs on at great risk, or you could just hire UiPath to build an RPA system for you that automates that software and presents a much nicer interface to users. This decreases the risk of upgrading all that software, it makes your users happier because they’re using a much nicer interface, and it might provide you some efficiency by developing new automated workflows along the way. UiPath built a fairly successful business doing that basic version of RPA; I encourage you to listen to our episode in 2022 where we unpack it in great detail. But as you might expect, that’s all getting upended by agentic AI systems that promise to automate things in much more powerful ways, with much simpler natural language interfaces. So Daniel has to figure out how UIPath can integrate and deploy AI into its products — or risk being made obsolete. Daniel and I really got into that, and then I also wanted to push him on the practical economics of the business. The big AI startups like Anthropic and OpenAI don’t have to make any profits right now. They’re just raising mountains of investment and promising massive returns when all of this AI works. But UiPath is a public company, and it’s licensing this technology at a cost. So I wanted to know what Daniel thought about the cost of licensing AI tech, selling it to customers, and trying to have all of that make a profit while the underlying economics of the AI industry itself remain pretty unsettled. We also talked about what all of this might mean for our experiences at work, and whether a world of robots sending emails to other robots is actually a good goal. This one really goes places — Daniel was game to truly dig in. I think you’ll like it. Okay, UiPath CEO Daniel Dines. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Daniel Dines, you’re the founder and — once again — the CEO of UiPath. Welcome back to Decoder. Thank you so much for having me, Nilay. I’m very excited to talk to you. I love a full circle episode of Decoder. You were last on the show in the spring of 2022. It’s been a little bit of a roller coaster since then. You were just about to have a co-CEO named Rob Enslin. You hired him from Google Cloud. Then, you stepped down a little over a year ago to focus on being the chief innovation officer. Then, Rob was the sole CEO. Then, Rob stepped down, and now you’re CEO again. You’ve made some changes to the company. Explain what’s going on there, because that’s a lot of decisions. Obviously, we’re a show about decisions, and there’s a lot of AI stuff I want to talk about. But let’s start with that little bit of history. Why step down and why come back? Well, roller coaster is a good word. Sometimes people exaggerate with it, but in our case, it’s really what happened. Why? Look, I was always trying to do what’s best for this company. This company is, in a way, my baby. I spent almost 20 years [building it]. This year, 2025, is 20 years since I founded UiPath. I thought that if we can get the best talent, and especially with [Enslin’s] background in go-to-market, this is going to help us. And Rob is a nice guy. We got along pretty well. And look, it’s been mostly a good ride. It gave me some time off, so I switched to chief innovation officer. I ran our product and engineering teams. In 2023, I had my own time for reflection, especially after I moved a lot of my responsibilities to Rob. I spent that summer in reflection mode, honestly, with a bit of soul searching around “what do I want?” I would say that I missed my early 20s craziness, with people having a lot of fun and going on spring break. I had to work. In post-communist Romania, there was a lot of turmoil, so life was not that fun for me at that stage. I thought maybe I will get to experience what it means to take it a little bit easier. It was important for me because I discovered that UiPath is actually kind of an anchor for me. It gives me a framework of mind, a direction. It’s very hard for me to wake up every day and give myself something to do unless I am in this big machine and this machine is on a trajectory. It forced my mind to be there. And I’m surrounded by great people. I talk to smart investors, analysts, customers, and partners. It’s a living organism. So, I discovered that this is a gift that I have, being in the position to run this company. Then, things in early 2024 didn’t go well for us, from an overall market perspective. I think the macro was pretty bad for some companies. We had some execution issues. Our initial go-to-market was “land and expand,” and we over-rotated the company to go mostly after big deals. So, our float business suffered, and paired with some of the macro challenges, it created a difficult environment. Rob decided to leave the company in May 2024. In all fairness, at the time, I was ready to take it back. It came faster than I anticipated, but mentally I was prepared after my summer and my time off. Did you go on a spring break? Did you take a minute? Were you in Palm Beach? No, no, I didn’t go to Palm Beach, but I spent a few weeks in the Mediterranean on a boat. So maybe close to it. Spring break is not the same in your 40s as it is in your 20s, is the thing that I’ve discovered. Yeah, exactly. I always want to drill into the actual moments of change. I always joke that I watch a lot of music documentaries. There’s act one where everyone’s in the garage, and there’s act three where they’re playing Shea Stadium. And act two, where the actual moments of change happen, are often glossed over. This is one of those moments. You made a decision to come back as CEO, Rob made a decision to leave. What was that conversation like? Did you initiate it? Did he start it? Was he leaving and you already decided that you were coming back? Walk us through it. It was simple actually. We decided to meet in New York following Q1 2024. He told me that he thought it was better that I take the company back and he resign for personal reasons. Indeed, he needed to take some time off because some members of his family were not well. I told him, “Let’s reflect a bit on this. Let’s think a bit.” But in the end, he was resolute in his decision. I also realized after that discussion that there will be many changes in the company. We needed to contract a bit. We oversized the company for this elephant hunting, so there needed to be a few changes. And I realized it’s actually better that I do the changes. It’s going to be a lot of pain, and we’ve already been through some pain. The last three quarters were not easy for us by any metric. Would you have made the change if he hadn’t volunteered? Was it obvious to you that you were going to come back as CEO? I realized something. It would be difficult to get an external CEO while I am here. It’s kind of not possible. I would consider growing someone internally rather than bringing in someone externally. It’s really hard to know someone after you talk for a few hours and you go for a dinner, and it affects the culture of a company so much. Even if I have the controlling stake of the company, it’s not like you get someone and you can command them every day, “You do this and this and this.” No, it has a really huge implications. I care deeply about the company and the people. Rob had all the best intentions in the world, but seeing the things that sometimes made me uncomfortable, it was not easy, and it’s not easy for anyone. Naturally, there were two camps created — Daniel Camp and Rob Camp — and sometimes they didn’t talk. Again, without our intention, it was a dynamic that didn’t work well. So to me, it was clear that I had to either take back the CEO role and drive the company, or next time I would step down completely. This is a pretty common problem with founders. Obviously, The Verge is much smaller than UiPath, but I only have a handful of co-founders left. I often tell people that they should be the editor-in-chief, and it’s perceived as a threat. They’re like, “No, we wouldn’t do it if you were here.” Did you have the power as the founder and the controlling stakeholder to say, “I’m just making this decision, I’m coming back?” Was there an approval process? This is one of those moments that seems like it comes up a bunch with founders. Theoretically, I had the power to do this, but in practical terms, it’s something very difficult to do. Look, we are a public company. It’s board governance. I have a seat on the board. The board should make the decision. So, the board would have to make a collective decision to fire Rob on my pressure. They could have mutinied against me, but it’s not so simple. It’s doable, but– That’s really the question. We see some of these decisions from the outside. The founder coming back as a CEO seems like a very natural course of events, but then it’s very complicated on the inside, particularly with founders who were the CEO, stepped aside for another CEO, and then came back. If there is a battle between the founder and the CEO, yes, things could be pretty ugly. In our case, it really was not. Rob really exited under the best conditions. He gave me all the time. He assisted me with the transition. He then took some time off to fix his personal stuff. From this perspective, it was a smooth transition. You mentioned the company had grown in ways you didn’t want it to. With a new CEO, there are cultural implications with how they would like to run the company. Then as the founder, you come back and want to change it back. You just reported financial results. Things seem to be a little more stable than they were in the past. What changes have you made, either to go in a forward direction or to go back to the way things were when you were CEO? I wanted to bring back some of our mojo of being customer-centric, working with customers, and doing whatever they required to be successful. We went back largely to “land and expand,” to being customer-centric while still preserving the muscle to do big deals. We need both. Forecasting is kind of difficult in a company that depends only on big deals. The lumpiness in revenue can create issues with forecasting. It’s normal to have both sides of the equation. That’s also a thing that I didn’t realize. We’re not a technology that you can go day one and say, “I will sell you a $100 million of automation.” Let’s see a smaller division and see how it works. Then, expand into other divisions, and then company-wide. So, regardless if you have a good Rolodex, you won’t go to another CEO and say, “Okay my friend, give me this big deal because I’m here for you, and I promise you we’ll do it best.” You need to prove it, and you need to earn your way into a company. That’s why, in our DNA, the essence is to stay extremely customer-centric, work with them, help them find opportunities, help them deliver the value, prove the value, and have them message internally about the benefits of automation. We kind of lost a bit of this muscle. And now, we’ve segmented differently. I created an executive accounting program where we have our top 50 diamond accounts with all our executives attached to those accounts, and we are taking it very seriously. We also have a co-innovation program where we build software together. We decentralized our customer success function that was centrally run. It was a bit disjointed from the sales motion, so we decentralized it into the region, and it’s much more aligned with the customer right now. We even changed the compensation of our sellers and customer success to be closer to the adoption of our software. Regional partners were also moved within the sales teams. I simplified and streamlined the international part of our business into one big region. There have really been a lot of changes. Were all those changes in your head while you were the chief innovation officer? You were watching the company change and the results, and you were thinking, “This is how I would fix it?” Or did you come to this plan after you retook the CEO role? I think some of the pain that we were experiencing was known at that point. The changes? Not really so much. It took me a month to understand who the people on my team would be and what kind of changes we were going to make. I love having people come back on the show because I get to read their old decision-making frameworks back to them. You left, you took a break, you got to think about who you wanted to be and how you wanted to spend your time. The last time you were on the show I asked, “How do you make decisions?” You said, “I’m trying to learn more by listening to people. I have no idea how to run a big company at this stage because I have never been in a similar situation before, but I’m trying to build a close-knit executive team that relies on each other.” Then, you said the thing people say, which is to “[make decisions] fast if they can be reversed, and do them slowly if they’re irreversible.” Is that still your framework? Have you come to a different approach? Are those still the basics? I think largely, yes. I like to give space to people to delegate. My style is to agree on goals, agree on the plans, and then let the people run. If I find issues, even small issues, my style is to dig around to see if there are signs of potential cancer or things that are completely not working. You discover interesting things. But yes, I think the faith of the company depends extremely on the cohesion of the leadership team. A big difference in how I make hiring decisions compared to 2022 is that I will never trade chemistry for talent. Bringing talent that doesn’t fit into an organization never works, and long term, it creates really big issues. I asked you about the structure of the company last time, and you had a really interesting answer. You didn’t talk about the structure at all. You talked about the culture and said you want the culture of the company to be “one single word.” The word you picked was “humility,” and you talked about that for a minute. It’s been two years since then. I’ve come to believe that the structure question is really a proxy for a culture question. By describing the structure of the company, you’re describing the culture. Would you still pick “humility” if I asked you to describe the culture of the company? I think at that time, humility was the most-needed aspect because we rode a very successful IPO, and our stock was very high. Many people made a lot of money. We lost a bit of humility at that point. Right now, we are back to our roots. I think the company has been through pain, and we understand better. Look, I am not smart enough to learn from successes, and UiPath is not smart enough to learn from successes, but I think we are smart enough to learn from pain and suffering. Humility was in the genesis of our company and it’s an integral part. What we need now more is to be bold and fast. We are making a big push into our agentic automation era, and I see great things happening. It’s a new energy. Also, we ran RPA (robotic process automation) for seven, eight years. There was a bit of fatigue at the end. We were just perfecting the software and getting into some white spaces, but it was not that exciting. Agentic AI brings a lot of excitement to the table. We pivoted in product and engineering overnight basically, more than half of the organization into building the new agentic products. All the teams are energized because they know. We basically put agentic automation as our number one priority as a company. We literally changed direction. It’s not the Titanic, but it’s a big boat. I think very few companies have a chance for an act two, and we have this chance. AI and automation are so synergetic. I think more and more people came to that conclusion. Agentic, in essence, is AI plus automation. It’s the fusion of AI and automation. We’re so well-positioned to deliver on this promise. So our product and engineering is going at a breakneck pace, making really bold decisions. From a technology standpoint, we’ve replatformed our workflow engine to a more modern technology. They really embodied being bold and fast. I cannot say yet that this is true for other parts of the company, and this is where I work with our leaders to be completely prepared for our act two. I’m going to ask one more question about structure, and then I have a lot of questions about agentic AI and automation. One of the big decisions you made when you took over the role as sole CEO once again is you cut about 400 people. You laid off 10 percent of the company. Did you end up restructuring around that cut? Why make that decision, and what was the goal? We looked into our central functions at that point. And in all fairness, we over-hired people in those central functions, and we had to streamline the organization. Decisions to fire people are the hardest from an emotional standpoint, from a cultural standpoint, and financially. It’s very hard to make them. Every time we had to do them, it’s been a thorough process. I was never rushing, and I was always fighting more on “do we really need to?” And it came at one of the lowest moments for us, along with the CEO changes. I think now, as we put it behind us, we are more prepared. The world is in an interesting, challenging phase right now. Nobody knows where it’s going to go. I think we as a company are a bit more prepared, more streamlined, and agile. We took time to heal the pain, and I think the confidence in the company is restoring. Looking back, I think that was the right thing to do for the company. I wanted to ask that question as the lead-in to AI. You’re describing making these cuts as a low moment, as something that was very difficult to do. The right decision, but very difficult to do. You pull the thread on AI, and what I hear from our audience is, “This automation is going to come for our companies and we will all be out of a job.” White-collar workers will be out of a job. Software engineers might be out of a job. Lawyers are terrified of being out of a job. Do you see that connection, that if your software is successful you will reorient the economy and a lot of people might lose their jobs? If we are realistic right now, it’s all a matter of the time of change, not the change itself. Your job and my job have changed over time. Jobs change. It’s a matter of when it’s going to be and how compressed the change is. Right now, I’m not so fearful that it’s going to come so suddenly. If you look at AI and the real use cases, we still have to see widespread adoption. It’s a productivity gain right now, more like an assistant type of AI. I ask something, I get that response, I do my job a bit faster and better. It’s not at the point yet to affect really huge volumes of the population. I think agentic AI is one of the steps toward deploying AI into more of an enterprise context, and it might accelerate the way jobs are transforming. What do I mean by this? I think a job today is not a simple task. There are very few people whose job you can describe as one single task. So a job is a multitude of operational things, repetitive things, and many ad hoc things. It depends on different environments and businesses. I think that many repetitive tasks have been solved. We have the technology to basically eliminate many of them from one’s job. Now we also have the technology to help people with more of these ad hoc tasks, like research tasks. I think the jobs will be moved more toward where people make decisions. They’ll analyze what information agents are retrieving and what they’re putting together. Agents plus automation. People will analyze, will make decisions, and then the actions will be carried on by enterprise workflows, robots that we already have. So jobs will transform more into decision-making, inspections, and overseeing from a command plane. I think about this all the time. I don’t know that I’m a great editor-in-chief. I feel like you could automate me by just walking into rooms and having a soundboard that says “make it shorter” or “make it longer,” and you just spin the wheel and pick one. But I know when to say those things because I spent years writing blog posts, then stories, and now podcasting. I have all this experience executing the decisions so that I have a high level of confidence in the decisions that I’m making when I make them. How do you get that if no one is executing the decisions? If that’s all robots? I just want to make a comparison to you. You were the founder, you spent all this time running this company. How would you make good decisions if you didn’t have all of that experience? The execution experience? Yeah. That’s a good question. Eventually, many things will be like a black box. I don’t know why if I press a key on my keyboard it displays on the screen, but I can make the decision to press. In a way, operations will be like a black box for many companies, and decisions will be at a higher level. I think we can still make decisions even if we don’t know how things are cooked behind the scenes. I’m curious how that plays out. I am of the school that says the best leaders are the ones who spent time on the ground. That’s not always true. I’ve talked to a lot of leaders on the show, but particularly when I talk to founders, that experience at every stage of the company is what informs the confidence to make changes. If operations are a black box, I wonder where that confidence comes from. I need to reflect more on that. Probably the best people will understand the operations as well. Even if they are carried out by robots and AI, they will understand in order to make better decisions and change the operations. But this is more of an analytical type of person. The types of jobs where there’s more mechanical typing, copying, and pasting are going to disappear. So the last time you were on the show, I don’t think there was a lot of hype around RPA. I was into it because I’m fascinated by the idea of computers using computers, and when you were on the show in 2022 was sort of the height of that. You were riding high. This is why you said you needed humility. The idea was that instead of upgrading a lot of old computer systems, we would abstract them away with UiPath technology, build new interfaces, and that would allow all kinds of flexibility. That was a big idea. I think that has changed. In the AI age, we see a lot of companies promising agentic capabilities. We see a lot of companies saying that they’ll move even farther up the stack, all the way up to decision-making. But when I look back on that conversation and everything that’s happened since, the thing that gets me is that robotic process automation, the idea that you have some old hospital building’s system and UiPath will build a modern way to use it, is deterministic. You knew where all the buttons in that software were, you could program your way through them. Maybe you needed some machine learning to understand the interfaces better or to make it less brittle, but you knew what the inputs and the outputs were. RPA knows the path between those things. AI is totally not deterministic. The robot’s going to go do something. Is there a connection between the software you were building, the RPA you are selling, and the agentic capabilities you want to build? Because it seems like there’s a fundamental technology shift that has to happen there. I think you expressed the essence of what we are building when you say deterministic and non-deterministic. These are exactly the terms I use when I am explaining how robots and AI should interact. Look, LLMs are not meant to do deterministic tasks. If you ask an LLM to multiply two numbers, it cannot figure out how to multiply two numbers because it’s not statistical matching. What it would do best is understand, “Ah, I’m required to multiply two numbers. I have a tool that knows how to multiply two numbers, so I will call a tool and I will get the precise answer.” This is how they work. They don’t have the intelligence inside them because it’s a non-deterministic tool. It’s not meant to do a series of deterministic steps. In the same way, you can think of transactional work that produces side effects in enterprise systems. It should be deterministic. You cannot have a 95 percent chance of succeeding a payment transaction. It has to be 100 percent, and if there is an exception, people should be notified. It cannot be “maybe.” Our robots offer this fully deterministic way to do transactions across multiple systems, transactions that create effects on these systems. With LLMs and with technology like OpenAI’s Operator or “computer use” from Anthropic — actually we are users, and we work closely with both of these companies to integrate their technology — you can complement what RPA is doing on parts of the process that you couldn’t automate before. If I have a process that relies on doing research… like if I’m traveling, I want to create a travel agent with AI. This travel agent will do research on available flights and across a multitude of airlines. It’s no big harm if I miss one flight option. So I can have a non-deterministic tool, go and extract the information, then an agent can make some decisions. It can present to the user, “These are available flights.” But then when I book a flight, I have to use something deterministic. When the money transacts, money changes hands. Basically we can have the best of both worlds. We can extend the reach of deterministic with non-deterministic while accepting the risks of non-deterministic. And there are domains like research or testing an application when we can take more risks. It makes sense. It depends on your level of risk you can accept. It makes sense to me. I see your competitors and your partners, like OpenAI and Anthropic, and they’ve made their entire technology bet on agentic AI. I assume that their plan is for that to get good enough to do everything. Your approach is that there’s some stuff that traditional RPA, the traditional deterministic computer, needs to do, and that can be layered with an LLM or an AI system. I’m just wondering what the intersection point is. Will there ever be an intersection point when OpenAI says, “Operator can do it all,” and that presents some kind of paradigm shift for your business? I am absolutely sure that the intersection point is when you can define a task in a deterministic way and know the steps. There is really no point in having an LLM that does this task all the time to rediscover how to do it or to think about every step because it’s impossible to get to 100 percent accuracy. We are testing these LLMs for simple form filling. They can work very well, but think about it. You need to run it hundreds, or even thousands of times to get to 100 percent accuracy. This is not what the technology is for. What I am saying is that LLMs will eventually create routines that can work 100 percent accurately. But the idea that LLMs will discover a process every time like you would when you see an application or a book for the first time in your life… humans don’t work like this. We learn. You learn an application, and then if you watch yourself, most of the things you’ll do will be on autopilot. We’ve had other companies come on the show and talk about their agentic software approaches. Actually, they were facsimiles of the agentic software they wanted to build. So, Rabbit came on the show, and its first version of the Rabbit R1 was running testing software in the background. You would ask for a song on Spotify, and it would just click around on the Spotify website in the cloud and then stream the song to you. Its claim was that it actually did build the agent, but it needed to build the first version and have proof of concept. But the deterministic system, in one very real way, can act like the thing people want from the AI system. It can almost do it and then it’s brittle, but the AI can make it less brittle by reacting to change or an unexpected outcome. How do you merge those things together? How do you decide which system to use? Because that seems like the technology problem of the moment. The way we are seeing the adoption of combined agentic AI and automation is by putting a workflow technology on top of it. Our agents are more like data-in, action-out agents — not necessarily conversational agents. We focus on delivering enterprise agents that work in the context of an enterprise process. So to us, the critical piece is this orchestration part. Let’s say you have a loan agent that has to approve some loans. A workflow is triggered when the loan application is received. So, you have an enterprise workflow. Then, that workflow will first send the application to a reading agent that is specialized in extracting the information from the application. Then, I can send it to a human user to verify something basic if I’m not confident enough in what I extracted. It can be a more junior person that does this verification. Then, the workflow will send it to an agent that will make loan recommendations. That agent can start to call tools like, “Get this person’s credit score.” So this tool is definitely something deterministic. It’s either an API to a credit score agency or you can use an RPA bot. That is clearly deterministic. You are not going to use something like OpenAI’s Operator to just figure out a guy’s credit score. There is absolutely no point. It’s taking too much time and it’s not reliable. Already you see it’s a combination. The workflow knows how to direct the fixed paths of a process, and then agents are capable of making recommendations and calling tools that will give the context. Then, after the agent makes a recommendation to approve this loan, it will go to a human user. The workflow will create a task, a human user will get it in their inbox asking them to approve or not. They press a button and approve. The workflow will go back maybe to the last agent and say, “Please compose a nice acceptance message particular to this client.” It’s a simplistic view, but this is how we believe the world and enterprise customers will adopt agents. Also, they need to have some confidence in the system. You said we are talking about this black box system, a swarm of agents that do their magic and sometimes they make mistakes. Until you accept it, you need to have confidence and you need to see the work. Everybody is more confident when they see the workflow. They can say, “Look, if that happens, it goes like this. If that happens, it goes like this.” So you can trace it, you can understand it, you can reason with it. One of my takes on the interaction between humans and AI is that for a long time we have to speak the same language. Even when you create an application or an automation, AI actually creates code. AI can eventually work directly with machine code. They don’t have to create Python code, but it’s important that AI creates Python code because humans can reason, change, and accept it. It’s going to be the same in automation applications. AI will use existing platforms, will create artifacts on top of those existing platforms, and people will validate what’s going on there. On the consumer side, the value of the existing platforms is, I think, under enormous threat. So I call this the “DoorDash problem” on the consumer side. We just had Amazon’s Panos Panay on, and it’s rolling out a new version of Alexa. You’re going to be able to say, “Alexa, buy me a sandwich,” and it will just get DoorDash to send you a sandwich. This is a huge problem for DoorDash. Its margins are under significant pressure if their interface gets commoditized in that way. We’re going to have the CEO of DoorDash on the show eventually and I’ll ask him this question. but I can abstractly see the pressure on some of these systems that are going to get commoditized by new kinds of interfaces. The classic RPA truly depended on those systems existing. You needed the existing loan system that nobody wanted to upgrade so you could build the RPA interface on top of it. You need the credit score interface that might not have a great API, but you can use RPA to go get it from their website. AI changes that because it’s coming to all of those systems as well. There’s some part of the AI industry that’s chasing all of those things at once, not just building this orchestration layer. What do you think about the long-term longevity of those systems? I look on the consumer side and I say, “Oh, this is a big problem for DoorDash. This is a big problem for Uber.” I don’t know exactly how it works on the enterprise side. We’ll see how it evolves. The fact that we still have a lot of mainframes, and our RPA touches a lot of mainframes, shows that the changing of enterprise systems is much more difficult than in the consumer space. If you look at complex enterprise applications like Workday and SAP, I can see people adding a nice layer of voice on top that’s AI-powered. You know, “Change my vacation responder to this.” But the tablet and mobile phone didn’t make the keyboard or mouse obsolete. I think they will still have to coexist. Many people can work on user interfaces faster with a keyboard than with voice, but voice is going to become a good way to interact with applications. When you need to absorb a lot of information simultaneously, you need the user interface. In many cases, you’ll still need to interact with it. It’s easier than telling the AI, “Please press the okay button.” I will just go and click the button. It’s easier and it’s faster. They have to coexist. I was thinking about the DoorDash problem. You’re basically saying that Amazon can build its own DoorDash. If it can control the interface with the client, it doesn’t matter who delivers in the end because– It’s not that they will build their own DoorDash. It’s that DoorDash’s opportunities to make additional revenue will go away. It won’t be able to upsell, won’t be able to do deals, won’t be able to have exclusives. The interface will be commoditized and it will just become a service provider with Amazon or whoever’s AI agent being in control of the business. You see that for a lot of these ideas. You need an ecosystem of service providers for the agent to go and address, and that crushes the margins of the service providers. It’s possible. I think I see it in the consumer space. You see the back and forth. There’s some amount of, “We don’t want you here. We’re going to block your agents from using our services.” That is already happening on the consumer side. There’s some amount of dealmaking. Then on the enterprise side, it seems like there’s going to be a lot of dealmaking where maybe instead of API access, we’re allowing agentic access or RPA access because the data is what’s valuable there. To a certain extent, we had the same problem with RPA. Think about the fact that most enterprise or SaaS software was licensed by user seats. With RPA, you needed far fewer user seats. You can have one seat that does the job of hundreds of seats. They found ways to kind of prevent this and create special service accounts to deal with it. Some vendors do not allow it. I’m sure they will find some ways to deal with it because how can Alexa order if DoorDash doesn’t want to receive the order? There has to be something in it for both of them. I think that’s an enormous technical challenge, and the business challenge is even harder. You have to get a lot of people to agree to fundamentally restructure their businesses in order for any of this to work. Again, on the enterprise side, there’s more dealmaking. You have some instincts, some history, some moves to say, “Okay, here’s how we’re going to structure access to the data.” I have no idea how it’ll play out on the consumer side. You mentioned a thing about LLMs not having memory, having to rethink the workflow every single time. That’s true. I think the AI companies are working on that. But they’re also pushing the idea of reasoning, that now we’re going to layer LLM approaches over and over again into a simulacrum of human reasoning. I don’t know if that’s correct. They say they can do it. Is that having an impact on what you’re doing? Can you say, “Here’s the decision, here’s the process by which a decision is made”? The way we are seeing the reasoning part is that it’s more helpful, in our world, for creating automations. We have this Copilot-type of technology where you describe a process and it can create the artifact to execute the process. The smarter an LLM is, the closer to reality the creation gets and the developer has to change it less. So in a way, it’s like creating code, if you want. It’s the same thing. The smarter LLMs will create better code, but that code is still going to be executed by hyperscalers. It’s not LLMs that do that. Think about it. Maybe LLMs will do everything. Why would they generate code at all? You mentioned hyperscalers. One of the things that I’ve been thinking about a lot is the amount of investment the hyperscalers are doing just to buy Nvidia chips, to build data centers, or to invest in nuclear fusion against the promise that there will be this much demand for AI services. They have to make money doing this somehow. It’s unclear how the bleeding edge, frontier AI companies are going to make money. I don’t know how OpenAI will ever make a dollar. I don’t know how Anthropic will ever make a dollar except by raising more money, which they’re very good at. That’s on a long-term plan. You’re a public company. You have to make the money. You have to buy the tokens, you have to use them, you have to build the products, you have to charge your market price. Are the rates we’re at now sustainable? I don’t know if it’s sustainable or not for them, but if I were them, I would do the same. What if this is indeed the biggest revolution of our time? What if all of these GPUs and AI agents will take over the world and I am not there? But I’m saying you’ve got to charge your customer some price for the use of an AI tool. You’re not running all of your own models. You’re partnered with some of these companies. You’re buying some of their capacity. They’re, in turn, buying capacity from Azure, AWS, or whatever they’re running on. All of these companies need a margin and some of their margins are negative. OpenAI loses money on inference right now, but it’s selling that capacity to you. At some point, they’re going to turn the knob and say, “We’ve got to make money.” They’re going to raise prices on you, and you’ll have to pass that cost to your actual customers who are actual businesses trying to automate their companies and raise their own margins. When will it become too expensive? That seems like the correction that’s coming. You’re going to say, “Okay, OpenAI raised our prices. UiPath has raised its prices,” and some customers are going to say no. If we look at through our lens of the processes we automate, what’s the alternative at this point? Using human labor? I think even if OpenAI increases prices, I still don’t think humans can compete with AI plus automation when it is possible. And long term, the pricing will go down and it’s a lot of competition for the business. I’m not really concerned about this aspect. Have you structured your technology so that you can swap between AI providers? Are you tied to OpenAI, Anthropic, or is that easily modular? No, not at all. We actually offer our customers a piece of technology that we call AI Trust Layer, where they can switch between different providers or bring their own on-prem model if they want. You just bought a company called Peak, which is another AI provider. Why make that bet? Why bring in technology? We want to get into vertical agents. Peak is a pricing and inventory agent, and it has really solid experience in delivering these dedicated solutions based on agentic AI, and we want to extend that. Of course, we’ll integrate it first into our platform, but we want to come out with more dedicated agents. It makes the entire go-to-market easier. We want it to work a bit like a locomotive for the entire platform because it can create more demand for automation. How does that technology plug into your existing stack? I understand it has markets you might not have or that you want to get bigger in, but ideally you buy a company and what you’re going to do is sell its existing markets more of your tools. Definitely. That was on our mind. I think we have really good synergies in our go-to-market, and we can really accelerate its go-to-market, particularly in the manufacturing industries. We have very solid manufacturing practices in the US, Germany, and Japan. Do you think there’s an opportunity for you to commoditize the AI tools themselves? I just keep thinking about this. You have your AI Trust Layer, you have your own vertical systems that you’re buying that you might deploy. At some point, what matters to companies is the business outcome, not that they have an OpenAI partnership. It feels like the big AI companies are trying to be everything to everyone, and you’re trying to specialize. Do you think at some point you’re going to say, “What we deliver are business outcomes and the technology doesn’t actually matter”? I think that generative AI is going through this phase. Initially, it was a nice toy. Everybody put budgets to experiment with it, and now we are moving toward the phase where people really want outcomes. Initially, they all used OpenAI, and our strategy was to use OpenAI because it’s the best. If you want to make a proof of concept, why would you use something different? But as you go and you specialize it for different types of industries and processes, you can choose whatever is more appropriate. We look at everything from DeepSeek, Llama, to Anthropic. We use all of them in different parts of the business. In the end, we are more of an AI engineering company, and our job is to build nice products that deliver value for customers. Behind the scenes, we use whatever LLMs are best for a particular scenario. I actually want to ask you about DeepSeek. Was that as shocking of a moment for you? The industry reacted to the idea that you could run the model much more cheaply very harshly — very harshly. Did you see that and say, “This will bring my cost down. This is also a revolution”? Selfishly, for UiPath, any open-source capable model is a great thing for us and for our customers. My belief is that these dedicated agents will require a combination of fine-tuning and really good prompts. So, if you can have a great model that you can fine-tune and combine with good prompts, that will provide the highest value and the cheapest price. We find you can actually distill it into a smaller model that works very well for a particular domain. Where do you see the biggest growth for traditional RPA, for AI, and for the hybrid of AI and RPA? RPA is an established industry right now that grows in the low double-digits. The demand that we are seeing right now for our agentic technology, I have never seen in the RPA world. It really opens all the doors. We get a seat at the table where we are not used to being from the automation perspective. People are really excited about this idea of agentic automation. They get it. The value proposition is kind of simple for us. I can go to my clients and tell them, “Guys, where did you deploy robots? How are people interacting with the robots today? Why are we not reducing the work of people, deploying agents, and creating an enterprise workflow that will connect agents with people and robots?” It’s a no-brainer proposition. It resonates, it’s simple, it creates a lot of excitement. I want to tell you about my favorite Slack room at Vox Media and get your reaction to it. We have a room called Finance Support, and in this room, people ask a Slack robot to do stuff: file invoices, give receipts, all this stuff. I look at this room once a week, and it cracks me up every time. I literally fall over and giggle every time because the people who are new to this room type full sentences: “Hi, I need help with this receipt. Can you itemize this thing? I’ve got a flight.” The people who are repeat users have discovered that they just need to scream nouns at a robot. So they just show up and they just say the word “expenses,” and all of this is in one stack. There are people who are very polite and then people who are just yelling nouns at a robot. You can see this secondary language of human-machine interaction developing: “I’m just going to say keywords to the robot because that’s all it needs from me.” I look at that and I say, “Oh, that’s a revolution.” First of all, it’s very funny. But this is a revolution in business. You’re going to have some people who are just saying keywords in Slack to get things done for their business to an agent that might just go off and do it, and then you have the people who are used to all of the niceties of business fluffing up their communication. At some point, you’re just going to have robots saying nouns to each other instead of using an API. In many ways, that’s what RPA was. You’re just using the human interface instead of an API. Do you see all of business changing around this as clearly as I do when I look at this Slack room? Yeah, and even for RPA, this is true. Many people are using RPA by creating a Slack channel that connects directly with a robot that does something. AI just extends the same idea. To me, it’s kind of fascinating how we communicate with bots. I discovered myself — well, maybe it’s just an impression — but if I say, “please,” I think that LLMs come back with better responses. [Laughs] Here’s something I also worry about. You’re the CEO. You get a lot of emails, you send a lot of emails. Do you ever worry about the loop where you’re responding to an email that was written by AI with another email that’s written by AI and suddenly everyone’s just pushing the summarize button and no one’s actually talking? I personally write my emails because everybody in the company and clients knows my own tone and my broken English. So I cannot use LLMs. But yes, I’ve seen many instances where it looks like LLMs are talking to each other. You’re the automation vendor. LLMs talking to each other — there’s something hollow there, right? Is that something you want to achieve with your products, or is it something you’re trying to avoid? I think to a certain extent we want to achieve that with our product. We want to facilitate agents talking to each other, but in a more controlled environment. Daniel, you’ve given us so much time. You’re going to have to come back. I feel like I could just talk about the philosophical repercussions of all of these systems with you for many more hours, but you’ve given us so much time.

If you’ve been struggling with gut issues, skin problems, or both, this probiotic formula might be the breakthrough you need. How Does Prime Biome Work? The Science Behind Its Powerful Effects The secret behind Prime Biome’s success isn’t just about probiotics—it’s about the gut-skin axis and how a balanced microbiome plays a direct role in skin cell regeneration, digestion, and inflammation control. This supplement is formulated to target the underlying causes of digestive discomfort, poor nutrient absorption, and premature skin aging, rather than just masking symptoms like conventional probiotics or skincare products. By combining clinically-backed probiotic strains (Verified) with powerful botanicals, Prime Biome delivers a multi-faceted approach to gut and skin health, ensuring that your body isn’t just looking better but actually functioning optimally from the inside out. Here’s a deep dive into how this supplement works at a cellular level. 1. Rebuilding the Gut Microbiome for Lasting Balance At the heart of Prime Biome’s effectiveness is its ability to restore and maintain a thriving gut microbiome. Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, and when the balance is thrown off—due to diet, stress, medications, or environmental toxins—it leads to digestive distress, chronic inflammation, and even skin problems like acne, dullness, and premature aging. One of the key probiotic strains in Prime Biome, Bacillus Coagulans, has been clinically studied for its ability to survive stomach acid and reach the intestines alive. Unlike traditional probiotics, which often get destroyed by the harsh stomach environment, Bacillus Coagulans form protective spores, allowing them to colonize the gut and repopulate good bacteria effectively. Study Spotlight:A 2022 study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Microbiology found that Bacillus Coagulans supplementation led to a 48% reduction in bloating, a 39% improvement in digestion, and a 41% decrease in skin inflammation within eight weeks of use.>>Warning: Avoid Fake Sellers! Get the Authentic Product Only from the Official Website – 75% Off Here. By feeding the gut with beneficial bacteria, Prime Biome helps to:✔ Reduce bloating and indigestion by improving food breakdown and absorption.✔ Eliminate toxins that contribute to inflammation and skin irritation.✔ Balance gut bacteria, ensuring a stronger immune system and a healthier skin barrier. 2. Enhancing Skin Cell Turnover for a Youthful Glow The gut-skin connection is one of the most overlooked factors in skincare. Most people rely on topical creams and serums, but the truth is, healthy skin starts from within. Prime Biome’s formula is designed to accelerate skin cell renewal by supporting collagen production and reducing oxidative stress, leading to firmer, clearer, and more resilient skin. One of the standout ingredients is Babchi (Bakuchiol)—a plant-derived compound often called “Nature’s Retinol” for its ability to stimulate collagen, reduce hyperpigmentation, and smooth out fine lines. Unlike traditional retinol, Babchi doesn’t cause irritation, dryness, or sensitivity—making it a perfect ingredient for gentle but effective skin renewal. Study Spotlight:A 2023 clinical trial conducted by the American Dermatological Society found that Babchi extract increased skin elasticity by 36% and improved hydration levels by 47% after six weeks of consistent use. >>Big Savings Alert: Buy Direct & Save!

By stimulating collagen and cellular repair, Prime Biome helps:✔ Reduce fine lines and wrinkles by promoting faster cell turnover.✔ Even out skin tone by minimizing hyperpigmentation and redness.✔ Strengthen the skin barrier, protecting against environmental damage and premature aging. 3. Reducing Inflammation for Gut and Skin Harmony Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest contributors to digestive distress, acne breakouts, and premature aging. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it triggers systemic inflammation, leading to poor digestion, increased breakouts, and even conditions like rosacea and eczema. To combat this, Prime Biome includes Lemon Balm and Organic Ceylon Ginger, two powerhouse anti-inflammatory ingredients known for their ability to soothe gut irritation, reduce oxidative stress, and calm the nervous system. Study Spotlight:A 2024 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Inflammatory Diseases found that Lemon Balm extract reduced systemic inflammation markers by 42% in individuals with gut dysbiosis and inflammatory skin conditions. By targeting the root causes of inflammation, Prime Biome:✔ Soothes gut lining irritation, preventing bloating and acid reflux.✔ Reduces skin redness and sensitivity, calming acne and eczema flare-ups.✔ Lowers oxidative stress, protecting cells from damage that leads to premature aging. 4. Optimizing Nutrient Absorption for Full-Body Benefits Even if you’re eating a healthy diet, your body might not be absorbing the full spectrum of nutrients due to gut imbalances. A damaged gut lining reduces nutrient uptake, meaning your body isn’t getting the vitamins and minerals it needs for energy, skin repair, and overall wellness. This is why Prime Biome includes Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin—two prebiotic-rich ingredients that strengthen gut lining integrity and optimize nutrient absorption. These plant-based compounds feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, ensuring that they flourish and support better digestion, increased hydration, and a more resilient immune system. Study Spotlight:A 2025 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Sciences reported that participants supplementing with Inulin and Slippery Elm Bark showed a 58% increase in nutrient absorption and a 33% improvement in digestive efficiency. By improving nutrient bioavailability, Prime Biome helps to:✔ Enhance energy levels, reducing brain fog and chronic fatigue.✔ Boost skin hydration, making your complexion more radiant and plump.✔ Support immunity, giving your body the strength to fight off inflammation and toxins. >>MUST-SEE: Shocking New Report Reveals the Truth About Prime Biome – Does It Work?

Are There Any Prime Biome Complaints? What You Should Know With over 50,000+ verified users, Prime Biome has built a reputation as one of the most effective gut-skin health supplements available today. But like any highly popular product, it has attracted its share of misinformation, fake reviews, and misconceptions. 1. The Truth About Fake Prime Biome Products One of the biggest issues is counterfeit supplements being sold on unauthorized platforms like Amazon, eBay, and third-party sellers. These fake products look identical to Prime Biome but contain low-quality, ineffective ingredients, leading to negative experiences and false complaints. Many customers who unknowingly purchased fake versions have reported zero results, not realizing they were not taking the real, clinically-backed Prime Biome formula. >> Avoid Fakes! Order Prime Biome Directly From The Official Website For 75% Off. 2. Are Competitors Trying to Sabotage Prime Biome? As Prime Biome’s popularity exploded, some competitors have resorted to unethical tactics to discredit it. There have been reports of: The reality? Prime Biome is disrupting the market, and companies that sell overpriced, ineffective supplements are losing customers fast. 3. Customers Who Give Up Too Soon Some negative reviews come from users who expect instant results. Unlike stimulant-based products that give you a temporary high, Prime Biome works by rebuilding gut health gradually. For best results, users should take Prime Biome consistently for at least 4-6 weeks to allow full microbiome restoration, improved digestion, and visible skin improvements. 4. Is Prime Biome a Scam? Absolutely Not. Prime Biome is backed by verified scientific research, real user success stories, and a 60-day money-back guarantee. Every bottle is produced in FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring that customers receive only the highest-quality formula. Unlike questionable supplements, Prime Biome offers full consumer protection, including: >> Don’t Fall For Fake Reviews—Try Prime Biome Risk-Free Today. Is Prime Biome Safe? Side Effects, Medical Backing & FDA Compliance When it comes to health supplements, safety is the number one concern—and for good reason. People are tired of hidden additives, artificial fillers, and sketchy products that claim to be “natural” but lead to unexpected side effects. Prime Biome is different. It’s not just another probiotic—it’s a science-backed, doctor-formulated supplement designed for long-term safety and effectiveness. But with so many gut health products on the market, does Prime Biome Truly Stand Out as a safe, risk-free choice? That’s exactly what we’ll uncover here. Does Prime Biome Have Side Effects? Here’s the Truth The reality is that Prime Biome is extremely well-tolerated, with no serious reported side effects from real users. However, like any probiotic or gut-supporting supplement, there can be temporary adjustments as your microbiome rebalances. Some new users experience mild bloating or gas in the first few days, which is actually a sign that the probiotics are working. When beneficial bacteria begin repopulating the gut, they start to outcompete harmful bacteria, which can lead to a brief period of digestive adjustment. This is completely normal and should subside within a few days as your body adjusts to a healthier gut environment. Most users find that after a short period, their digestion becomes smoother than ever—with reduced bloating, better regularity, and improved overall comfort. Another important factor to consider is allergies. Prime Biome is free from common allergies like gluten, dairy, and soy, making it a safe choice for those with sensitivities. However, if you have specific plant allergies, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting. >> See Why Prime Biome Is Trusted By Thousands For Gut And Skin Health – Learn More. Prime Biome Ingredients – What’s Inside and Why It Works The carefully selected ingredients in Prime Biome make it one of the most powerful gut-skin health supplements available today. Each component is backed by scientific research, ensuring that every gummy delivers maximum benefits for digestion, microbiome balance, and skin renewal. Unlike other probiotic supplements that simply introduce bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by ensuring that those bacteria thrive, repairing the gut barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy skin cell turnover. Bacillus Coagulans is a unique spore-forming probiotic that survives the acidic environment of the stomach. Many probiotics die before they reach the intestines, but Bacillus Coagulans remains stable and activates exactly where it's needed. This probiotic supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves nutrient absorption, and strengthens the connection between gut and skin health. A 2025 clinical study found that people supplementing with Bacillus Coagulans saw a 49% improvement in digestion and a 35% reduction in skin irritation within eight weeks. Babchi is a rare botanical known for its skin-rejuvenating properties. Unlike harsh retinoids that cause irritation, Babchi provides natural collagen-boosting effects, helping to maintain skin elasticity. Its antioxidant-rich profile also neutralizes free radicals that contribute to premature aging, breakouts, and inflammation. Research suggests that regular use of Babchi may enhance skin firmness by 31% within three months. Dandelion is an underrated detoxifying herb that helps the liver and digestive system eliminate waste and excess toxins. Poor digestion often leads to toxic buildup in the bloodstream, which manifests as dull, acne-prone skin and bloating. Dandelion extract works by stimulating bile production, supporting digestion, and reducing gut inflammation, making it a critical component in restoring gut-skin harmony. Fennel is a potent digestive aid that helps reduce bloating, gas, and discomfort. It is particularly beneficial for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic digestive distress. By soothing the gut lining and promoting the movement of food through the intestines, fennel ensures a smooth digestive process, leading to clearer, healthier skin. Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that acts as fuel for probiotics, ensuring that the beneficial bacteria in Prime Biome can flourish. Without prebiotics, probiotics struggle to colonize the gut, reducing their effectiveness. Inulin helps stabilize blood sugar levels, improves digestion, and supports immune function, making it an essential component in long-term gut health. >>FLASH SALE: Secure Your 75% Discount Now – Limited Stock! Fenugreek is known for its ability to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut microbiome diversity. Unstable blood sugar levels often lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger acne and skin irritation. By keeping blood sugar steady, Fenugreek helps regulate oil production, reducing breakouts and promoting a clear, even complexion. A clinical trial published in 2024 found that Fenugreek supplementation led to a 41% reduction in inflammatory skin conditions and improved digestive function in participants. Lemon Balm is a powerful stress-reducing adaptogen that plays a critical role in supporting the gut-brain axis. Chronic stress is one of the leading causes of gut imbalances and skin issues, as elevated cortisol levels disrupt digestion and increase inflammation. Lemon Balm helps lower stress hormones, allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance naturally, leading to better digestion, reduced bloating, and a calmer, healthier complexion. Organic Ceylon Ginger is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory ingredients in Prime Biome. Unlike regular ginger, Ceylon Ginger contains higher concentrations of gingerol, which reduces gut inflammation, supports circulation, and improves digestion efficiency. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach skin cells, improving hydration and elasticity while reducing puffiness and dark spots. Organic Lion’s Mane is a rare medicinal mushroom that enhances cognitive function, gut health, and immune system strength. One of its lesser-known benefits is its ability to promote gut barrier integrity, reducing the risk of leaky gut syndrome. This, in turn, leads to clearer skin, reduced inflammation, and better overall wellness. A 2025 study found that individuals taking Lion’s Mane experienced a 38% improvement in gut microbiome diversity and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels. Slippery Elm Bark is a well-documented gut-healing botanical that soothes intestinal irritation, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. It forms a protective layer over the digestive lining, preventing toxins from leaking into the bloodstream, a common issue that contributes to chronic inflammation, acne, and dull skin. This natural protective effect makes it one of the most powerful gut-soothing ingredients in Prime Biome. Why the Combination of These Ingredients Makes Prime Biome So Effective The true power of Prime Biome lies in its formulation. Each ingredient was chosen to create a synergistic effect, meaning that the combination delivers results that are far more powerful than using any single ingredient alone. Many probiotic supplements fail because they lack prebiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and skin-supporting botanicals. Prime Biome’s formulation solves this by ensuring that every ingredient works together to target gut health, inflammation control, and skin regeneration simultaneously. The balance of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-supporting botanicals ensures a thriving microbiome, better digestion, and more radiant skin over time. The absence of stimulants, fillers, and synthetic ingredients makes Prime Biome a truly clean and effective formula for people struggling with bloating, digestive issues, and skin concerns.

The Life-Changing Benefits of Prime Biome It’s not just a probiotic. It’s not just a skin supplement. Prime Biome is a complete transformation system, designed to revive digestion, restore microbiome balance, and enhance skin health from within. If you’ve been dealing with bloating, gut discomfort, unpredictable digestion, dull skin, or premature aging, ignoring Prime Biome might be the biggest mistake you didn’t know you were making. Most supplements promise short-term, surface-level benefits. Prime Biome, on the other hand, gets to the root cause of your problems—poor gut health, inflammation, and microbial imbalance—fixing them from within. When your microbiome is optimized, your digestion works effortlessly, your skin glows, your energy levels skyrocket, and your immune system becomes stronger than ever. 1. Revives Digestion and Eliminates Bloating Like Nothing Else Anyone who has suffered from bloating, indigestion, constipation, or food sensitivities knows how frustrating it is to feel like your gut is constantly working against you. The problem? Most digestion supplements fail because they only mask symptoms rather than addressing the root cause—a poorly functioning gut microbiome. Prime Biome is different. It restores balance from within, using a powerful blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing botanicals that optimize digestion long-term. This isn’t just another "gut health" product that gives you temporary relief. Prime Biome reshapes your digestion permanently, allowing you to enjoy food without discomfort, bloating, or unpredictability. >> See How Prime Biome Can Transform Your Digestion – Learn More. 2. Turns Back the Clock on Aging Skin—From the Inside Out Think your skincare routine is enough? Think again. Your gut controls how your skin ages. You can spend hundreds of dollars on creams, retinoids, and serums, but if your microbiome is imbalanced, your skin will continue aging prematurely. Prime Biome does what no topical skin care product can—rebuilds healthy skin at the cellular level. No other supplement combines these skin-enhancing benefits with deep gut healing. That’s why people who use Prime Biome report visibly younger, clearer, and more radiant skin within weeks. >> See how Prime Biome can revitalize your skin from within – Click here. 3. Balances Hormones and Boosts Metabolism If you’ve been struggling with unexplained weight gain, sluggish energy, or mood swings, your gut is likely out of balance. A poorly functioning gut leads to hormonal chaos, making it harder for your body to burn fat, control cravings, and sustain high energy levels. Prime Biome’s unique formula corrects this imbalance by: Most people assume that slowed metabolism is a normal part of aging, but the truth is your gut plays a far bigger role than you realize. Prime Biome ensures your hormones stay balanced, metabolism stays high, and fat-burning remains effortless. 4. Strengthens Immunity and Reduces Chronic Inflammation A weak immune system isn’t just about getting sick more often. Chronic inflammation—triggered by poor gut health—leads to: If your gut is inflamed, your entire body is suffering—even if you don’t realize it yet. Prime Biome’s potent probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants work to eliminate inflammation at its source, strengthening immunity on a cellular level. No single ingredient supplement can deliver this level of immune support. Prime Biome’s full-spectrum formula ensures your body stays resilient, energized, and free from chronic inflammation. The Scientific Testing Behind Prime Biome’s Ingredients Every single ingredient in Prime Biome has been carefully selected and clinically tested for safety and effectiveness. Unlike many “mystery blend” supplements that don’t disclose their full ingredient list, Prime Biome is completely transparent—so you know exactly what’s going into your body. Every batch of Prime Biome is lab-tested for purity and potency, ensuring each gummy contains the optimal amount of these clinically supported ingredients. >> Discover the scientifically backed formula of Prime Biome – Click here. How GMP Certification and FDA Compliance Ensure 100% Safety Prime Biome is manufactured in a state-of-the-art, FDA-inspected facility that follows strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). What does this mean for you? Absolute safety, quality, and consistency. Many supplements on the market cut corners during manufacturing, using cheap fillers, unverified ingredients, or low-quality processing. That’s never the case with Prime Biome. Every bottle undergoes rigorous third-party testing to confirm purity, potency, and safety. Here’s why this matters: These strict safety measures separate Prime Biome from other supplements that lack proper regulation. If a product is not made in a GMP-certified facility, you should be questioning its safety. Debunking the Myth: “Natural Ingredients Can Still Be Dangerous” There’s a common misconception that just because something is “natural,” it’s automatically safe. While some herbal supplements do have risks, Prime Biome was specifically formulated by medical professionals to be both effective AND safe. Here’s why Prime Biome’s formula is different from unregulated, “natural” supplements that could pose risks: The problem with many supplements is poor-quality sourcing—some companies use low-grade, contaminated, or improperly dosed ingredients, leading to potential safety concerns. Prime Biome avoids these issues by using only premium, carefully sourced botanicals and probiotics. Long-Term Use: Is Prime Biome Safe Over Months or Years? Unlike stimulant-based weight loss pills or harsh detox supplements that can cause issues with long-term use, Prime Biome is designed to be taken daily for lasting benefits. Gut health isn’t something you fix overnight—it’s a lifelong commitment. The longer you take Prime Biome, the stronger your microbiome becomes, leading to: Because Prime Biome is free from additives, artificial chemicals, and stimulants, there is zero risk of dependency, withdrawal, or long-term damage. Users who have taken it for months report sustained improvements in digestion, energy, and skin clarity—without any negative effects. Why No Serious Side Effect Complaints Exist It’s rare for a supplement to have thousands of satisfied customers and no widespread complaints—but Prime Biome is one of those rare products. Most “side effects” reported are mild, short-lived, and linked to the gut adjustment phase, which resolves itself within a few days. Unlike synthetic supplements that lead to jitteriness, dependency, or digestive distress, Prime Biome works with your body, not against it. Additionally, because Prime Biome is only sold through the official website, customers receive fresh, verified bottles that are properly stored and handled. This prevents issues that occur with fake supplements sold through third-party retailers. With a 60-day money-back guarantee, GMP certification, FDA compliance, and real scientific backing, Prime Biome sets the gold standard for probiotic safety. >>Don’t take risks with your health—choose the safest gut-skin supplement today. Why Prime Biome Works Better Than Traditional Probiotic Supplements The probiotic supplement market is flooded with products that promise to restore gut balance, but very few deliver real, measurable benefits. Most probiotics are either too weak, unstable, or incapable of surviving the harsh environment of the digestive tract. This is where Prime Biome sets itself apart. Unlike generic probiotic pills that contain a few bacterial strains with questionable survival rates, Prime Biome’s advanced gut-skin formulation ensures that beneficial bacteria reach the intestines and provide real, lasting results. Most probiotic supplements suffer from a low bioavailability problem—the bacteria they contain often fail to survive stomach acid and bile. This means that by the time they reach the intestines, where they are needed most, only a fraction of the probiotics remain active. Prime Biome’s unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and skin-supporting botanicals ensures that its beneficial bacteria are delivered in a stable, bioavailable form. Ingredients like B. Coagulans, a robust probiotic strain, form protective spores that allow them to withstand stomach acid, ensuring that they reach the gut intact. Another major flaw of traditional probiotics is that they often lack prebiotic fibers, which are essential for feeding and sustaining beneficial bacteria. Without these nutrients, probiotics can struggle to colonize the gut effectively. Prime Biome includes high-quality prebiotics such as Inulin and Fenugreek to nourish the good bacteria, allowing them to multiply and thrive. This powerful synergy between prebiotics and probiotics leads to better digestion, reduced bloating, and enhanced skin clarity. Additionally, Prime Biome doesn’t just stop at gut health—it directly supports skin regeneration and cellular renewal. Many probiotic supplements fail to consider the gut-skin axis, which plays a crucial role in overall health and appearance. By including herbal extracts like Babchi, Lemon Balm, and Organic Lion’s Mane, Prime Biome ensures that the gut microbiome remains balanced while also promoting a clearer, more youthful complexion. >> Want to see why Prime Biome is outperforming traditional probiotics?

How Prime Biome Supports Weight Loss Through Gut Health Optimization Many people struggle with stubborn weight gain, bloating, and digestive sluggishness without realizing that an imbalanced gut microbiome is one of the biggest hidden obstacles to fat loss. Prime Biome works by restoring gut health, which in turn optimizes metabolism, reduces inflammation, and enhances nutrient absorption—all of which play a direct role in weight management. Scientific research has shown that the composition of gut bacteria significantly affects how the body stores fat and regulates appetite. When harmful bacteria outnumber beneficial bacteria, it can lead to increased fat storage, insulin resistance, and an inability to efficiently break down and absorb nutrients. Prime Biome counteracts this by replenishing the gut with beneficial strains like B. Coagulans, which help break down food more efficiently and support a healthier metabolic rate. Inflammation is another major contributor to slow metabolism and stubborn fat retention. Chronic inflammation disrupts hormonal balance, increases cravings, and makes weight loss an uphill battle. The anti-inflammatory properties of Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm in Prime Biome help to soothe the digestive system, reduce bloating, and promote better metabolic function. By calming gut inflammation, these ingredients allow the body to burn fat more efficiently while keeping energy levels stable. Another overlooked factor in weight gain is poor digestion leading to bloating and water retention. Many people mistake digestive bloating for weight gain when, in reality, their gut is simply struggling to break down food properly. Prime Biome contains powerful digestive-supporting herbs like Slippery Elm Bark and Fennel, which improve gut motility, reduce water retention, and ensure that nutrients are absorbed efficiently rather than being stored as excess fat. The Little-Known Link Between Gut Health and Hormonal Balance While most people associate gut health with digestion, very few realize just how deeply the gut microbiome impacts hormonal balance. The microbiome plays a critical role in regulating cortisol (stress hormone), insulin (blood sugar regulation), and estrogen (reproductive health)—all of which influence metabolism, mood, and even skin clarity. Prime Biome’s carefully formulated blend of probiotics and herbal adaptogens directly supports hormonal balance, leading to improved metabolic function, reduced stress, and clearer skin. One of the most damaging effects of an imbalanced gut is elevated cortisol levels, which can lead to stress-induced weight gain, poor digestion, and breakouts. When stress hormones spike, they trigger inflammation throughout the body, including the gut and skin. Prime Biome helps regulate cortisol by including adaptogenic herbs like Lemon Balm and Organic Lion’s Mane, which promote relaxation, reduce stress-related inflammation, and support a stable gut environment. Insulin resistance is another major consequence of poor gut health, often leading to blood sugar spikes, cravings, and increased fat storage. Beneficial bacteria are responsible for breaking down dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help regulate insulin sensitivity and prevent glucose spikes. Prime Biome’s combination of prebiotics and probiotics ensures that the gut microbiome is functioning optimally, preventing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. For women, hormonal imbalances related to estrogen metabolism can significantly impact skin, weight, and mood. The gut plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating excess estrogen, and when the microbiome is disrupted, it can lead to estrogen dominance—causing bloating, acne, mood swings, and stubborn fat accumulation. By restoring microbial balance, Prime Biome helps the body regulate estrogen naturally, reducing these symptoms and promoting a healthier hormonal environment. What Makes Prime Biome’s Ingredients So Powerful? A Deep Dive Into the Science Unlike generic probiotic supplements that rely on a limited number of bacterial strains, Prime Biome is formulated with a comprehensive blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and botanical extracts—each chosen for its scientifically backed ability to promote gut and skin health. This multi-layered approach ensures that every ingredient works in synergy to optimize digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being. B. Coagulans, the probiotic powerhouse, is one of the most resilient bacterial strains, capable of surviving stomach acid and colonizing the gut effectively. Studies have shown that B. Coagulans reduces bloating, supports immune function, and enhances nutrient digestion. Unlike many probiotic strains that require refrigeration, B. Coagulans remains stable at room temperature, making it more effective in supplement form. Babchi, the plant-based collagen booster, is a powerful antioxidant known for promoting skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and supporting cellular regeneration. This ingredient enhances collagen production, which is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin. Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm play a dual role in reducing inflammation and supporting digestion. These ingredients improve gut motility, prevent bloating, and help break down food more efficiently, ensuring that the gut microbiome remains balanced and thriving. Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin act as natural prebiotics that fuel the growth of beneficial bacteria. They enhance gut barrier function, preventing toxins and harmful bacteria from entering the bloodstream, which is a major contributor to inflammation, acne, and digestive discomfort. By formulating Prime Biome with highly bioavailable, scientifically backed ingredients, the supplement delivers far superior results than standard probiotic capsules. Rather than simply replenishing bacteria, it creates an optimal gut environment where beneficial bacteria can thrive, repair gut lining, and restore digestive health—leading to better metabolism, clearer skin, and overall vitality.

April 07, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Rocket Lab and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until April 28, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Title: Jefferies tells tech giants that tariffs are a 'free hall pass' to reset their goals

Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies. In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a "free hall pass" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures. "Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance," said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill. The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days. The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health. Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days. The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets. Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider. For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, "likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks," the analysts wrote. The Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties. Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10. The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. At market close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 6%, the Dow was down 5.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week. On Monday, Asia stocks opened deep in the red. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning. "Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday. "The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion." Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Key Points Why Google’s and Meta’s Stocks Are Down Market Reaction to TariffsRecent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, effective as of early April 2025, have led to significant market volatility. These tariffs, including a 10% blanket tariff on all imports and higher rates for specific countries like China (34%), have raised concerns about increased costs for companies with global supply chains. For Google, this means higher expenses for imported components used in hardware like Pixel phones and Chromebooks, potentially squeezing profit margins. For Meta, similar cost increases affect its hardware division, such as Oculus VR headsets. Impact on Advertising RevenueBoth Google and Meta rely heavily on advertising revenue, which could be indirectly hit by tariffs. Higher prices for imported goods may reduce consumer spending, leading to lower ad budgets from businesses, especially international advertisers. For Meta, it’s noted that 10% of its 2023 revenue came from Chinese companies advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which could be at risk if tariffs raise costs for these advertisers Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta. Global Operations and Economic UncertaintyBoth companies have significant international operations, and the tariff-induced economic uncertainty could disrupt global trade, affecting their revenue streams. This broader market unease, as seen in the sharp declines in major indexes like the Nasdaq (down 5.97% on April 3, 2025), has contributed to the stock drops Stocks ravaged by tariff fallout as global supply chains brace for impact.

Title: A Tesla Uber-Bull Analyst Cuts His Price Target For The Stock By ~50 Percent, While Declaring That “Darker Days Are Ahead”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Tesla shares are now down around 40 percent so far this year, hammered by a fierce competition wave out of China and politically motivated boycotts in the US and the EU. Now, a Tesla uber-bull analyst seems to have read the proverbial writing on the wall by slashing his erstwhile sky-high stock price target by nearly half. $TSLA: Wedbush cuts target price to $315 from $550 "We remain bullish on Tesla, but this is a critical moment for Musk. The brand is weakening as a political symbol, and the situation is unsustainable. Musk has overcome major challenges before — this may be his toughest yet." — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) April 6, 2025 To wit, Wedbush's Dan Ives has now slashed his price target for Tesla shares by 42.7 percent from $550 to $315, while retaining an overall 'Outperform' rating on the stock. Even though Ives asserts that his "long-standing bull view of Tesla remains," he adds a qualifier by conceding that "this is a pivotal moment of truth for Musk to turn things around...or darker days are ahead." Ives goes on to note: "We have been one of the biggest supporters of Musk and Tesla over the last decade....but this situation is not sustainable and the brand of Tesla is suffering by the day as a political symbol." In what constitutes a sooting salve for the frayed nerves of Tesla investors, the Wedbush analyst notes that "Musk has been with his back against the wall many times and every time Tesla came out of it and was stronger on the other side...this may be one of his biggest challenges yet to turn around." As mentioned earlier, Tesla sales have struggled lately in the face of stiff competition out of China and politically motivated boycotts in the EU and the US. Elon Musk recently alienated a large segment of the German population by vigorously supporting the far-right AfD party in recent elections. Meanwhile, in the US, Musk's DOGE-related activities continue to drive a political wedge into Tesla's brand image. And, now we have solid numbers to back assertions of ongoing brand damage. As we reported last week, Tesla's deliveries cratered to multi-year lows in the first quarter of 2025, with the EV giant managing to record sales of just 336,681 units in the recently-concluded quarter against expectations of 377,600 units (IR-compiled consensus estimate). What's more, Tesla's inventory level soared from 77,330 units at the end of Q4 2024 to 103,264 units at the end of Q1 2025, despite a retooling-driven extended halt across the EV giant's production lines ahead of the launch of the Model Y Juniper.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

Title: Tariffs: Are A Recession And Bear Market Inevitable?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

Title: Tariffs: Are A Recession And Bear Market Inevitable?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions.

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday. This article was first published on April 6, 2025. It has been updated to add context and a link to Monday's live markets coverage.

Title: As Europe rearms, where is Australia's Future Fund investing?

(AP Photo: Julio Cortez) It's worth watching. With everything that's happening in the world, where is Australia's sovereign wealth fund (the Future Fund) investing on behalf of Australians? It recently released its six monthly investment update. The update shows what stocks it bought and sold between June and December, and what returns its stock holdings are generating. We've previously written about the controversy surrounding a list of 30 "defence companies" the Future Fund has direct shareholdings in (i.e. global weapons manufacturers and aerospace companies). You can see the original list here. Let's revisit that list to see how the Future Fund's investments in those stocks are going (according to its Periodic Investment Report 31 December 2024). The federal government has been accused of politicising the Future Fund by changing its mandate, but its investments have always been tangled up in politics. The latest data show that, between June and December, the value the fund's shareholdings in the companies on that list jumped by $94 million. The value of its shareholdings increased significantly in Axon Enterprise Inc. (+132.5 per cent), Elbit Systems (+102 per cent), Lockheed Martin (+52.5 per cent) and Thales (+41.98 per cent). The value of its shareholdings in Northrop Grumman (+33.4 per cent), the Boeing Co. (+26.6 per cent), and RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon Technologies) (+13.9 per cent) also rose noticeably. Many of those companies are the subject of international divestment campaigns. The table below shows the value of the fund's shareholdings in those companies. In the table, a change in the value of the shareholdings reflects the Future Fund's decision to buy (or sell) more of each stock, an increase (or decrease) in the price of each stock, or both. Norway's sovereign wealth fund has many of those companies on its exclusions list for things like human rights violations, production of nuclear weapons, and particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms. However, there's currently a debate in Norway about the wisdom or otherwise of maintaining such strict ethical guidelines for its sovereign wealth fund in today's environment, when the global security landscape is evolving rapidly and defence spending is rising. Just last month, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned these were "momentous and dangerous" times and Europe was now living in "an era of rearmament". With that in mind, another Future Fund investment worth watching is Palantir Technologies. Between June and December, the value of the fund's shareholdings in Palantir increased from $5.5 million to $20 million (+263 per cent). The company's share price jumped by 192 per cent in those six months, and the Future Fund bought more stock, increasing its shares from 144,897 to 163,479. What does Palantir do? Coles plans to deploy data company Palantir's tools across more than 840 supermarkets to cut costs and "redefine how we think about our workforce". At a time of increased food insecurity, Australians should question if this is the right direction. It sits on the frontier of Big Data analytics (it was named after the seeing stones in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings). Early in its life, it received seed funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital arm, and much of its revenue derives from government clients such as military, immigration departments, and police agencies, in the United States and overseas. It has been the subject of a slew of books about Silicon Valley's billionaires and the deep connection between modern national security and the surveillance state. Its artificial intelligence software has helped US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials conduct workplace raids, family separations and deportations. It's the subject of international divestment campaigns due to its "strategic partnership" with Israel's military. It also works with large companies such as Rio Tinto, WesTrac, and Coles supermarkets (it has offices in Canberra and Sydney). The US billionaire Alex Karp, chief executive and co-founder of the company, published a book in February titled: The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief and the Future of the West. It's currently ranked No.1 on the New York Times bestseller list. In the book, Mr Karp argues "the West" is superior and software and technology companies must forge a deeper bond with the state to help the West maintain its geopolitical and economic dominance this century. Norway's sovereign wealth fund recently took a huge $US1.4 billion position in Palantir (significantly increasing its stake in the company). The Future Fund also piled into Tesla stocks in the second half of last year. Its purchases roughly coincided with the election of US President Donald Trump in November. Elon Musk's electric vehicle company has also been targeted by vandals in recent months amid backlash to his embrace of far-right politics. Between June and December, the value of the Future Fund's Tesla shareholdings jumped from $159.2 million to $472.7 million (+196 per cent). That's nearly half a billion dollars. Tesla's share price jumped by 104 per cent in those six months, and the Future Fund increased its shareholdings by 34.8 per cent (from 537,358 to 724,704 shares). But we'll have to see what happens to those shareholdings when the Future Fund releases its next six-monthly investment update. Tesla shares have plummeted 40 per cent in value this year, due partly to the global backlash against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has unveiled its ultra-fast charger that promises to take just five minutes to fully power EVs — putting heat on rival Tesla in the process. Interestingly, the Future Fund also owns shares in Tesla's rival, the Chinese car maker BYD, but its shareholdings in BYD are small in comparison. And the fortunes of BYD are tracking in the opposite direction of Tesla's right now. BYD generated $170 billion in revenue in 2024 (soaring past Tesla's annual revenue of $155.5 billion). It reported a 73 per cent surge in net profit to a record $3.3 billion for the fourth quarter last year, and its share price is up 32 per cent this year. Between June and December, the value of the Future Fund's BYD shareholdings rose from $10.6 million to $17.9 million (+69 per cent), and it bought 88,900 more shares.

Title: ‘Nowhere to hide.’ How Apple and others in Silicon Valley are bracing for Trump tariffs

The iPhone is a quintessentially 21st century product — Californian in its creation and design and now enmeshed in the global economy. Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, though in recent years the Cupertino-based company has made more of its products in India, Vietnam and other nations. In all, the tech giant says it relies on more than 50 countries and regions to put AirPods, iPads and MacBooks in the hands of consumers. Now, that global supply chain is under siege. This week, President Donald Trump said he would impose a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries on Saturday. His administration also added tariffs of 34% on China, 46% on Vietnam and 26% on India. “Apple has nowhere to hide,” said Eric Harwit, professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “No matter where they’re making their technology, they’re going to be suffering, they’re going to see higher costs.” Trump’s sweeping tariffs have rattled both investors and some of the world’s most valuable tech companies that have fueled the global economy and Silicon Valley’s growth. They’ve also raised questions about whether these global businesses will pass the higher costs onto consumers or slash their payrolls. Apple has been especially hard hit. Its stock plunged more than 9% on Thursday and dropped another 7% on Friday to close at $188.38. Share prices of other tech titans, including Google’s parent company Alphabet, Meta, chipmaker Nvidia and Amazon, also saw big declines, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite to fall 5.8% on Friday — more than 20% below its record set in December. The unease reflects worries among investors that the tariffs could cause lasting damage, potentially making it harder for the U.S. tech industry to compete globally and dominate the race to deploy artificial intelligence technology, analysts said. The duties also are expected to drive up the costs of consumer electronics, including the iPhone, as products become more expensive to produce. “Technology pervades everyday life and these tariffs are attacks on consumer electronics,” said Todd O’Boyle, vice president of technology policy at the Chamber of Progress, a trade group. “They’re attacks on everything that we buy and that includes any foreign parts with global supply chains.” The levies could cause consumers to pay as much as $2,500 more for an iPhone, which costs roughly $1,000, depending on the model. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also produce consumer gadgets but make billions of dollars annually from ads purchased by brands in other countries, which some analysts say could also drop if these advertisers pull back spending. Meta declined to comment, but its annual report cites the possibility that tariffs or a trade dispute could result in a drop of its China-based ad revenue. The company has also expanded production of its mixed reality headsets in Vietnam. Alphabet — which makes phones, earbuds, smart speakers and other consumer electronics — also has cited tariffs among the manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm its business. It did not respond to a request for comment. The White House said it’s imposing tariffs because it wants to shift more manufacturing jobs back to America. Relying too much on foreign producers could threaten economic security by “rendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks,” Trump said in his executive order. “These America First economic policies delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and everyone from Main Street to Wall Street is again going to thrive as President Trump secures our nation’s economic future,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. He cited recent multibillion-dollar commitments made by companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Apple to build more manufacturing plants in the United States. The tech industry has been bracing for more tariffs ahead of what the president dubbed “Liberation Day.” The Trump administration already imposed tariffs on certain auto parts and imported aluminum and steel, materials that tech companies use to build data centers that store and manage computer hardware and equipment. The administration spared those materials, along with copper, from its latest tariffs. Semiconductors that power electronics and AI systems also were excluded from what the White House dubbed “reciprocal tariffs.” Exactly how tech companies will respond to the costs of tariffs is still unclear. While Trump wants businesses to shift manufacturing back to the United States, they could also move production to places with lower tariff rates. It would take years for businesses to build new factories. It’s also possible these tariffs will not remain. During Trump’s first term, Apple got exemptions from tariffs imposed on imports from China for some of its products including its smartwatch. Trump’s tariffs in his second term go well beyond China, affecting more countries. Nick Vyas, founding director of the Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute at USC’s Marshall School of Business, said the Trump administration is signaling to businesses that simply shifting production to places outside China isn’t enough. “‘Every dollar that I open up my market for you, I need you to open up the market for me [to] the same degree,’” he said, describing Trump’s thinking. Some tech companies have made efforts to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. Among them is Santa Clara-based chipmaker Nvidia, one of the world’s most valuable companies. While it appears Nvidia would be spared from the brunt of the tariffs because of the exemption to semiconductors, some industry observers said more tariffs could still be coming. Trump told reporters on Thursday that “chips are starting very soon” when asked if tariffs for chips are off the table. “We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around,” Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at a Q&A with analysts last month. “Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.” Apple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston. The company said in its annual report that “substantially all” of its manufacturing is done by partners primarily located in mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Shifting where iPhones and other Apple products are made is not easy. China has engineers who can meet the high quality specifications on Apple products and the U.S. doesn’t have that great a number of engineers with those same skills, Harwit said. “It’s really that level of manufacturing expertise that Apple developed over many years that make it very difficult for Apple to give up on China and for the U.S. to find the skilled workers really needed in the United States to meet their needs,” he added. Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said that it would take Apple three years and $30 billion to move just 10% of their supply chain from Asia to the U.S. Plus, the iPhone’s price tag would increase to $3,500, he estimated. “The chances that Apple and the overall tech supply chain moves to the U.S. is a fantasy, fictional tale, unless you like $3,500 iPhones, $2,500 TVs and $300 AirPods,” Ives said.

With 272 miles of range and more room inside its walls than your first apartment, GM’s Chevy Brightdrop electric van is one of the best commercial EVs you can buy. And if you’re a Costco Executive member, you can get one for yourself or your business with an absolutely incredible $31,500 discount. (!) Fleet electrification expert Tony Nisam took to LinkedIn yesterday to post a deal that he ran across at a Washington State Costco that stacks a $25,500 manufacturer rebate with $3,000 in “regular” Costco Member Savings, $2,750 in “LIMITED-TIME” Manufacturer to Member Incentives, plus an additional $250 for Costco Executive members. Do a bit of math (add up 25,500 + 3,000 + $2,750 + 250), and you’ll calculate an almost unheard of $31,500 discount on one of the best, most capable commercial vans on the market – ICE or electric. And that’s before you factor in the 0% interest financing (72 mo.) being advertised at Blade Chevrolet, the Mount Vernon, Washington, where VIN 2G58J2TY6S9104313 (the exact van shown, below) is shown as stock number 16757. If you’re not a Costco member yet and you’re looking for a new truck for your business or even a unique #vanlife ride with zero emissions, modern tech, and a nationwide dealer network, GM makes that $130 Executive membership seem like a no-brainer. “But wait,” says the floating, disembodied ghost of the great Billy Mays. “There’s more!” In addition to the $31,500 worth of discounts Costco Executive members get, there are deals to be had on chargers AND a number of other state and local utility incentives your business might qualify for, bringing the cost of adding a new Chevy Brightdrop to your fleet even lower. In northern Illinois, for example, ComEd commercial customers can get up to $7,500 in rebates for a new Brightdrop Zevo van. Is a $39,000 price cut enough to get you to take a look at a new Brightdrop? At $45,235 (from a starting price of $84,235), can you afford not to? Head down to the comments and let us know.

Title: Trade deficits happen for good reasons — not only from unfair practices
URL: https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2025/04/05/trade-deficits-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-05T18:29:08Z

On April 2, the Trump administration announced a system of tariffs on imports into the United States. The executive order imposed 10% tariffs for imports from all countries (excluding Canada and Mexico, which remain subject to tariffs imposed over the last two months) which take effect April 5, with higher tariffs for countries with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficit, to begin April 9. This means that imports from the European Union will be tariffed at 20%, while imports from China will see tariffs of 34% (see here for the full list of tariff rates.) In the short run, these tariffs will lead to increased prices, particularly for household products, cars, construction materials and some food items. As an example, the U.S. imports the bulk of its jasmine rice from Thailand which will have a reciprocal tariff of 36%. The extent to which the 36% tariff will be borne by rice farmers in Thailand, importers, grocery stores or households depends on the relative price sensitivity of each of these groups, but economic consensus is that households will bear at least part of that cost through higher prices. Items from toothbrushes to cars to washing machines will be similarly affected. Changes in the relative price of some goods and an increase in economic uncertainty around the profitability of some lines of business will lead to changes in investment decisions by companies in the United States. Retailers like Target, Amazon and Walmart will see margins tightened and will have decreased incentive to open new stores or expand existing retail locations. Auto manufacturers will delay production as they seek to understand the impact on their business from the changes in tariffs. One early example is Stellantis, the manufacturer of American auto brands Chrysler and Jeep, who announced on April 3 that it will pause production on some auto lines leading to temporary layoffs for 900 hourly U.S. workers. Delays in production and investment are likely to continue as uncertainty about the way that these policies will alter the U.S. economy are digested. These reductions in investment and production delays increase the near-term likelihood of a recession. If tariffs persist, they will change the composition of the U.S. economy. Tariffs increase the prices at which domestic producers of tariffed products can sell their goods. This increases potential profits in protected industries, leading to higher prices and often lower quality for manufactured goods. It also leads to shifts in the nature of goods produced in the economy. Previously profitable sectors of the economy will see decreased demand as prices rise which will lead to layoffs and a short-term increase in unemployment. If the tariffs continue, jobs will eventually migrate to more tariff-protected segments of the economy. This will lead to overall declines in growth however, as these tariff-protected regions of the economy grow because of the increased profits associated with tariffs as opposed to increases in the demand for their products. The executive order issued this week gives justification for the imposition of tariffs as “... a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption ...” However, the tariff rate imposed on our foreign trade partners seems to be proportional to the ratio of the U.S. trade deficit with that country divided by the total dollar value of goods imported from that country, with a minimum rate of 10%. As such, the policy enshrines the idea that if there is a trade deficit, it is because of unfair trade policies on the part of foreign counterparties. Yet this is largely not consistent with the nature of trade. Just as most households run a trade deficit with the grocery store (“importing” goods from the store in exchange for money), we choose to import goods from abroad because they can be produced more efficiently there and we would rather use our productive capacity to produce higher-margin goods and services. We do not produce significant amounts of jasmine rice in the U.S. because doing so would be expensive for us and we would rather use our land and labor to produce goods and services that allow us to profit from our unique productive abilities. Complicating the role of tariffs is the reality that one cannot decouple foreign demand for American-produced goods, which reduces the trade deficit, from foreign demand for American assets, which increases it. When a U.S. distributor of luxury Swiss watches pays $5 million for a shipment of timepieces, the Swiss manufacturer of those timepieces can choose what to do with that $5 million. They can use those dollars to purchase American-made goods, or they can use that money to purchase American assets like real estate, stocks, bonds or Treasury securities. If they choose to purchase assets, then there is an increase in the trade deficit, which measures differences in the value of the shipment of goods (as opposed to assets) across borders. As such, the size of the trade imbalance with a country is inextricably linked to the relative desirability of American assets. The attractiveness in recent decades of American assets, and foreigners’ willingness to purchase them, is an important driver of our trade balance. This foreign investment in the U.S. because of the desirability of American assets has allowed U.S. companies to hire additional workers, produce additional products, and offer dividends that would not otherwise have been possible. A cooling of trade between countries as a result of tariffs will reduce this source of capital. One open question is whether the tariff announcement this week represents a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy that will persist throughout President Trump’s term in office, or whether it is the opening offer in bilateral trade negotiations to be had with our trading partners over the coming weeks, as has happened with Canada and Mexico since Trump’s inauguration in January. Retaliatory tariffs from across the world is also a high likelihood. Either way, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of policy in recent months and the questions that remain about the current proposal run the real risk of decreasing short-term investment and hiring by American companies and the desirability of American assets to foreigners. These risks have increased the likelihood of both inflation and decreased growth in the near term.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States?

Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters.

Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers.

Title: Why Big Tech Interviews Take So Long. Here’s How To Beat The Process

ByCheryl Robinson ByCheryl Robinson, Contributor. Long interview processes at major tech companies are leaving job seekers waiting weeks for a ... More response. If you’ve ever felt like the interview process at a major tech company drags on forever, you’re not imagining things. A new study from Career.io confirms what many job seekers have suspected: landing a role at a top tech firm often means surviving a long, winding hiring process with the worst offenders keeping you waiting for nearly a month. The study analyzed publicly available data from 14 major U.S. tech companies, ranking them based on how long it typically takes to move from interview to job offer. The results? Some of the biggest names in the business aren’t just giants in innovation—they’re giants in hiring delays, too. At Oracle, candidates often wait close to four weeks for a response—if they receive one at all. According to reviews on Glassdoor, some candidates said their interview process lasted up to two months. Apple isn’t far behind, with an average turnaround time of 22 days. Adobe and Salesforce also require candidates to buckle up for a wait exceeding three weeks. While hiring managers may aim for the perfect fit, they inadvertently drive top talent away. Studies show that 82% of candidates lose interest in a role if the interview process drags on too long. This growing phenomenon, known as interview fatigue, occurs when job seekers become mentally and emotionally exhausted from drawn-out hiring procedures, repetitive interview rounds and unclear timelines. According to insights from Titus Talent, companies risk losing strong candidates not because of poor fit but because of poor processes. Amanda Augustine, a certified career coach at Career.io, says there’s a reason hiring has become more prolonged in recent years. “The tech industry has intensified the interview process, largely due to heightened competition stemming from layoffs,” she explains. “Hiring managers in big tech now hold more leverage than ever, implementing more rigorous and lengthy interview processes to identify the ‘best fit’ among a broader pool of applicants.” That means multiple interview rounds, technical assessments, culture-fit evaluations and follow-up conversations—all before a decision is made. Not every tech company is stuck in the slow lane. According to the report, Uber has the fastest hiring process, averaging just 9.34 days from interview to offer. Amazon (10.11 days) and Netflix (14.23 days) follow close behind. There’s a reason for this efficiency: Uber and Amazon rely heavily on high-turnover frontline workers like drivers and warehouse staff, necessitating a streamlined process. But it’s not just about speed for the sake of speed. Netflix, for example, emphasizes cultural alignment during their process, with multiple interviews and a final “vibe check” to ensure a strong team fit. Augustine notes, “Both Uber and Amazon have a reputation for hiring with flexibility in their workforce. The speed of drivers’ and warehouse workers’ onboarding has resulted in an expedited interview process, highlighting the operational priorities within the tech sector.” Interview fatigue is rising as candidates endure multiple rounds and extended timelines in today’s ... More competitive job market. Lengthy interviews aren’t going away anytime soon, but job seekers can approach them more strategically. Augustine recommends three ways to manage the marathon process: Interviewing at big tech firms may require patience, resilience, and a plan B. But with the right mindset and a few smart moves, candidates can stay in control—even when the process drags on.
