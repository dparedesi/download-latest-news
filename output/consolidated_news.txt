Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two weeks into Tesla’s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety. Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who’ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses. The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver’s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles. Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it’s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they’re concerned about several incidents — documented on camera and shared on social media — where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who’ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla’s share price. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government. In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why. In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back. Some elected officials in Austin said they’re worried about the incidents. “There are just a lot of errors,” said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. “They have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.” And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn’t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government — which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust. “Tesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I’m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites’ safety,” she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla’s service halted for now. Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried. “We’ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,” he said. He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there. It’s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court. The Austin Police Department said in a statement: “As with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,” the department said. Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency “is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.” Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously. “I think that it’s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,” she said. Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 — the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law. Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company’s driver-assistance software. “I’ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,” she said. “I’ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.” Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla’s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear. Tesla’s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service. The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms. The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. “Take a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,” the person’s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment. Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service. “I was totally trusting of the technology,” she said in a YouTube video on her channel, “Ellie in Space.” She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car’s audio system to say that she couldn’t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.) Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla’s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach. “Elon must have a reason for why he believes in that,” she said. She’s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they’ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: “flawless,” “seamless” and “history-making.” But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren’t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand. Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla’s already-converted choir of supporters. Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google’s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla’s most enthusiastic fans are “all fairly convinced that it’s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don’t see it.” Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they’re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven. “What matters is not individual demonstrations. It’s statistics,” he said. Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 — six and a half years ago. Waymo began “rider only” rides in 2019. Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water. One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being “flooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. … The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.” The top comment on the post asked for a truce. “I want to see progress by both companies,” the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. “Waymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.” “I just want cars to drive themselves,” they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: 'Should I still consider a pension plan If I'm already investing?'

Welcome to The Money Coach, a Times of Malta column where readers can ask questions about life's money issues. Send your questions about personal finances, inheritance, gifting or other personal finance topics to moneycoach@timesofmalta.com I have been investing consistently since the beginning of 2025. I am 23 and I want to set myself up with the possibility of retiring early at the age of 55, living solely on my investments. My portfolio is composed thusly: Primarily ETFs consisting of S&P 500, STOX600, Vanguard FTSE All World ETF, and Gold. I also have speculative investments in the fields of nuclear power, quantum computing and to a lesser degree Cryptocurrency related stocks (MicroStrategy, Etoro, Webull, BlackRock, Coinbase, (without directly buying any cryptocurrency) I have done well for myself so far with a sizeable unrealised gain and frequent dividend payments. However, I have some queries which persist. Lately, I have been bombarded with emails and calls to sign up for a Private Pension Plan. In a way, I have my investment portfolio intended to cover my retirement expenses. Is there any benefit in investing in a pension plan instead/also? What is the catch? My second question revolves around taxes. Namely I understand that taxes are paid on any realised gains. Seeing that my investments are yielding unrealised gains, and any dividends gained are reinvested; what are my obligations regarding local taxes? My third question has to do with the fact that when I near my retirement age, I need to start liquidating my assets. How would you approach this matter? Would you liquidate a lump sum every year or withdraw money from the brokerage account gradually? My last question has to do with the brokerage application I use. I have in the past dabbled with some day trading on eToro. I have moved past trading to some disciplined Dollar Cost Averaging on Trading212. I find the interface of this application intuitive as it facilitates rebalancing and the stock purchases are commission free. Trading212 has long been touted as an ideal application for beginners. But I feel a consistent sense of insecurity on the long-term (up to retirement) sustainability of the application and how would my investments be affected if the platform goes bust. Regards, Disciplined Young Investor Dear Disciplined Young Investor, First of all—well done. Many people don’t even have such a goal, let alone by age 23. The fact that you’ve already thought about retiring at 55 and are investing consistently is a strong foundation. With a time horizon of 32 years, you’re giving yourself a real chance. Historically, by consistently applying DCA (dollar-cost averaging) into the market - especially something like the S&P 500 - you’re likely to see average returns of around 8–10% per year. You’ve set yourself up well. Your portfolio appears to be thoughtfully constructed. From what you've described, you’ve included a mix of broad-based ETFs such as the S&P 500, STOXX600, and Vanguard FTSE All World, along with some exposure to gold. This type of approach is often associated with diversification and relatively lower fees. Including a smaller allocation to sectors like nuclear energy, quantum computing, and crypto-related equities suggests that you've taken an interest in emerging industries as well. While every investor's approach will differ, having a clear strategy and awareness of your overall risk profile is always a good starting point. On your question about private pension plans—here’s the straight answer: There are two main advantages: 1. 25% tax credit (capped at €750/year as of the latest update - check for changes yearly). 2. Illiquidity: This may not seem like a benefit now, but the fact that you can’t access it until retirement actually protects you from dipping into it impulsively in the future - especially when life throws unexpected costs your way. But there are drawbacks too: Whether or not to open a private pension plan depends on your personal circumstances and long-term goals. While some individuals choose to include it as part of their broader financial planning (mainly to benefit from the tax credit and the structured approach it offers) others may prefer to continue investing independently. If it’s something you’re considering, I’d suggest reviewing the terms carefully, paying close attention to all fees involved, and seeking guidance from a licensed financial advisor before making any decisions. On the tax side, it is best to always consult with a licenced tax advisor in such case. As a Financial Coach I’m afraid I cannot help you much there. On withdrawals at retirement: You don’t need to worry too much about this now, but as you near your goal of retiring at 55 (or even before), the strategy will have to shift. When that time comes It is again best to consult with a licenced tax advisor specialised on investing to see what would make most sense to your portfolio at that point in time. And lastly: Trading212. I agree that it’s intuitive, low-fee, and great for DCA. But I do understand your concern about long-term sustainability. The key question to ask is whether the platform is regulated by a major authority—like the FCA (UK), or MFSA if local. If it is, your investments are technically held with a custodian, not the platform itself, meaning that if Trading212 ever goes bust, your holdings should remain safe. That said, it’s smart to stay updated on the platform’s status, and eventually—when your portfolio gets larger—you may want to consider splitting your funds across two platforms (or more), just as an added layer of protection.

Title: Are Deals Back? IPOs, M&A Recover After 'Liberation Day' Blip

For a while, it looked like the boom in deal activity that was expected after President Donald Trump retook the White House wouldn't happen. Companies pulled IPOs as the Liberation Day tariffs hit sentiment, while others put acquisition plans on hold. Deals, in short, dried up. But that seems to be changing. Deal activity is picking up for a host of reasons, experts say, among them Trump's retreat from some of his harsher tariff plans and increasing investor expectations that trade deals will be struck or tariffs at least kept at their baseline levels. Add to that a relatively resilient U.S. economy and record-high stock markets and you get a recipe for rising deal volume. IPO and M&A volumes are at their highest levels in years, according to Dealogic data, after years when high interest rates put a damper on things. In the first half of 2025, 174 companies raised more than $31 billion from U.S. IPOs, the most since 2021, when a record $200 billion of funds were raised in the same year-to-date period. U.S. M&A volume so far this year has already topped $989 billion, the highest level since 2021's record year, when there were $1.56 trillion in deals in the same period. Trump's Liberation Day tariffs hit stock markets and led companies like Swedish fintech Klarna to pause plans for IPOs. That's changing as investors are piling into tech and fintech firms, and investors are eyeing the possibility of interest-rate cuts in the second half that could keep stocks rising. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), has since seen its shares more than triple since its March listing. USDC stable coin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) was among June's IPO stars, benefiting from the increasing popularity of crytocurrencies and bitcoin; Israel-based retail trading platform eToro (ETOR) and space and defense tech firm Voyager Technologies (VOYG) were also among June's star listings. Circle and CoreWeave "in particular have been outstanding performers and a big driver of investor interest," said Dealogic’s Global ECM Head Samuel Kerr said. The pipeline of new deals is now building up again: In early July, design software maker Figma filed for an IPO. Here are 2025’s top five US IPOs ranked by funds raised, according to Dealogic. LNG exporter Venture Global (VG) raised $1.75 billion from its January IPO, the most by a listing so far this year in the U.S. and the most since Lineage's $5.1 billion listing in July last year. Unlike some more recent tech IPOs, its shares have lagged below their listing price. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), raised $1.57 billion from its listing on the Nasdaq in March. It had a tepid debut, but has since become one of this year's stars, trading more than three times above its $40 IPO price. SailPoint, a Texas-based cybersecurity company that private equity firm Thoma Bravo took private in 2022, made its return to public markets in February, raising $1.38 billion from its listing. Its shares continue to lag its $23 IPO price. Crypto firm Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has been one of this year's IPO stars, raising $1.21 billion from its IPO priced at $31 a share in June; the stablecoin issuer's stock is now around $189. The fifth-biggest IPO this year was the $994 million June offer by fintech firm Chime Financial. Its shares remain above their $27 IPO price. M&A volumes, which like IPOs took a hit this year, have been helped by enthusiasm for companies linked to artificial intelligence. “Although March brought a burst of large-cap deals, optimism faded in April after ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs sent shockwaves through the market," Mergermarket Head Lucinda Guthrie said. "Still, the opportunities presented by the volatility in the public markets drew attention from private capital. A key deal driver in 1H25 has been M&A to fuel the evolving AI landscape. " Here are the top M&A deals so far this year in the U.S, according to Dealogic, ranked by deal size, with No. 1, the funding round into ChatGPT maker OpenAI— illustrating the allure of AI investments. (All the deal volumes are excluding debt.) The ChatGPT maker raised $40 billion in new funding from a group of investors who took a 13.3% stake in a round led by SoftBank Group. Other investors included its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT). Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struck a $32 billion cash deal for cybersecurity startup Wiz in March that would be the tech giant’s largest acquisition ever. The deal hasn't closed yet. In June, Swiss building-materials company Holcim spun off its North American operations in a $28.7 billion deal. The Chicago-based cement and roofing provider started trading under the stock symbol (AMRZ). Charter Communications (CHTR) announced a $24.1 billion deal in May to buy privately held rival Cox Communications in a deal that would combine two of the U.S.'s largest cable providers. The deal has yet to close. Nuclear power producer Constellation Energy (CEG) agreed to buy private energy company Calpine for $17 billion excluding debt, a transaction that would create the largest clean energy provider in the U.S. The combined company would serve the AI boom, feeding the growing power needs of data centers.

Title: Finding George Gibney: ‘I feel sad for 13-year-old me and nine-year-old Ber, who were not believed’

Earlier this week, not long after The Irish Times had printed the story of George Gibney’s arrest in the United States under the headline “George Gibney facing 79 charges relating to alleged sexual abuse of four girls,” my phone pinged. “I am so glad. But feel sad for 13 yr old me and 9 yr old Ber, who were not believed,” it said. The text was from Tric, a talented swimmer, who had been one of six people involved in a case in Ireland against Gibney in the 1990s that was halted in the Supreme Court. The sentiment had nothing to do with self-pity but the name, the arrest, the charges hit hard, like an emotional jolt from the past. The broad outline of the allegation in the news story about Gibney’s US arrest was not dissimilar to the case involving Tric Kearney, Ber Carley and others. [ US government asks court to detain George Gibney until Irish extradition case is concludedOpens in new window ] The latest legal filings lodged in the US district court showed that Gibney had been accused of 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape over the alleged sexual abuse of four girls and the alleged attempted rape of one of the girls. Much like those allegations made decades ago, all four girls were minors, aged between eight and 15, and were coached by Gibney at the time of the alleged abuse. The text was a reminder that sometimes in the glare of headlines and the frenzy of how quickly news moves, how many charges are brought and how many people are involved, the human cost to nine- and 13-year-old girls can be forgotten. The original 1993 charges, at Dún Laoghaire District Court, were 27 counts of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge of young female swimmers under the age of 15. But no case was ever heard in Dublin. Gibney’s accusers have never had their day in court and that has been a devastating truth to live with and a source of deep frustration for more than 30 years. Gibney’s lawyer argued in an Irish Supreme Court judicial review at the time that he could not defend himself, as some of the allegations went back to the 1960s. It was true, some charges did go back that far. But some were also from the 1980s, just 11 years earlier. The line of defence that allegations reached too far back in time was an idea that became a dark in-joke to those involved in the case. It was simultaneously absurd and enraging. Gibney had introduced modern ways of training to his athletes. Before his name became synonymous with allegations of abuse, he was diligent and detailed and encouraged swimmers to keep meticulous diaries so that if they swam a national or event record, they could look back and see what training they had been doing to get the time. They kept their diaries. Following on from the Supreme Court ruling, Mr Justice Declan Costello in the High Court granted an order prohibiting the Director of Public Prosecutions, Eamonn Barnes, from proceeding with the charges against Gibney. Leave to appeal was granted but no appeal was made by the State. Gibney left Ireland when he was released in July 1994, a free and innocent man in the eyes of the courts. By then the Sunday Tribune (where I was working at the time), along with Gibney’s star swimmer of the time, Gary O’Toole, a double Olympian from Seoul and Barcelona, and European Championship silver medallist, had taken up the story and published details of the allegations against the coach. In an unusual request, all swimmers who were mentioned in the Sunday Tribune were asked for sworn affidavits and agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper’s defamation lawyer Hugh Mohan. For surety, more legal advice was taken from barrister and future Supreme Court judge Adrian Hardiman. The assumption was that Gibney would sue. But he did not. By the time the story was published he was already on the move and turned up in Warrender Baths Swimming Club in Scotland, working as a coach. Warrender, who had a medical doctor on their board, were horrified when informed of the allegations made in Ireland. By the end of 1994 Gibney was sacked and fled again, this time to the US. With an uncanny knack of moving and turning up at places where they needed a swimming coach, he emerged at the North Jeffco Swim Team in Arvada in Colorado in late 1995. He seemed to be endlessly landing on his feet. [ Why has it taken so long to arrest George Gibney in the US to enable extradition?Opens in new window ] People wondered how that could be before realising that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA), the then governing body of swimming in Ireland, had robustly defended Gibney and showed him astonishing deference. An example of that was in 1992, in what most people would have considered clear grounds for standing down Gibney as national coach. After the Barcelona Olympic Games in which O’Toole competed, he wrote to the Leinster Branch requesting a meeting them in December at the Ashling Hotel in Dublin, where he was accompanied by another swimmer, Chalkie White, and the husband of a female swimmer. O’Toole spoke first to the president Harry Kavanagh, the secretary Mary O’Malley and the treasurer Eddie Eaton, telling them he believed Gibney was a paedophile and had been sexually abusive to boys and girls for years. He advised them that the gardaí were involved and taking statements from various people and alleged that Gibney had tried to get into bed with him as a young swimmer before the young O’Toole garnered the strength to ask him to leave the room. The husband said to the Leinster Branch that his wife had been repeatedly sexually abused by Gibney and White alleged that as a boy he too had been molested by the coach. O’Toole urged the Leinster Branch to remove Gibney from Irish swimming and cancel a swimming course for 11- to 15-year-olds a few weeks later in early January. However, when Gibney was asked to step away, he threatened to sue the organisation. The juvenile course went ahead with Gibney in charge. Gibney was given life membership by the IASA in 1989 and despite the court case and the Sunday Tribune coverage, it was not rescinded until the beginning of 1997. The Sunday Tribune sent their story to Colorado and Gibney was moved again, this time to California, before settling in Florida. This week, with the arrest of the 77-year-old in Florida, the image of a younger Gibney standing at the pool deck with the large round glasses and goatee beard, the timing device slung around his neck like a stethoscope and the Sergio Tacchini polo shirt, has circled around and again brought people back in time – back to a small 25-metre swimming pool in Blackrock, Co Dublin, where a club called Trojan used to train. Trojan was where talented Irish swimmers wanted to be during the 1970s and 1980s, because Gibney was one of the best. It’s where he got his break after starting out working in swimming clubs at various pools around the Dublin area, including the Guinness pool, Marian and Waterford Crystal before moving to Glenalbyn in the early 1970s – a pool that is no longer functional, located beside the Kilmacud Crokes GAA club in the suburb of Stillorgan. A convincing, can-do coach, Gibney struck up close relationships with swimmers’ parents, easily gaining their trust, and by the mid-1970s Trojan was the top club in Ireland. He had a highly convincing personality and his CV was impressive. As well as being national director of swimming, he had published works on lactate testing in swimmers. He was a member of the National Training and Coaching Centre in Limerick University and the Irish Recreational Management Association, as well as an RTÉ Sports commentator for the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he rapidly rose through the swimming ranks in Ireland to become the Irish Olympic coach in 1988 for the Seoul Olympic Games and the IASA’s national director of swimming in 1991. But just three years after that appointment he was leaving everything he had created in Ireland. Behind were the accusers left to deal with an alleged abusive coach who they said had shattered their trust and altered their lives, a swimming association that turned away when their need was most desperate, and the rank failure of an Irish judicial system that had given process but, in their eyes, denied dignity or justice. Gibney might have been ducking and diving by state-hopping in the US, but because of the company he had kept at home, he was never far from the Irish public consciousness. By the end of 1997, Derry O’Rourke, who succeeded him as national coach, stood in the dock at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, where he pleaded guilty to 29 sample charges of sexual abuse against 11 young swimmers on numerous occasions between 1976 and 1992. Early the following year, O’Rourke, who used to try to hypnotise his swimmers, was jailed for 12 years by Judge Kieran O’Connor. O’Rourke’s investigation began in 1993, the year Frank McCann was formally charged with the murder of his wife, Esther McCann (née Leonard), and his 18-month-old foster-daughter Jessica McCann, when he set fire to their family home in Rathfarnham. The couple had been trying to adopt Jessica, but the process had been delayed, due to information gleaned by the adoption agency that McCann, president of the IASA Leinster Branch and a swimming coach, had fathered a child with a 17-year-old student. McCann is currently serving a life sentence in Arbour Hill Prison. It would take more than another decade but Ger Doyle, a successor to both Gibney and O’Rourke as national coach, would also find himself in the dock. In 2012, the 51-year-old from Wexford pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual assault and 34 charges of indecent assault at New Ross Swimming Pool between January 1981 and December 1993. The jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all charges. He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and released in 2015. To many people it beggared belief how so many figures involved at the higher levels of Irish swimming chimed so closely with allegations of child sexual abuse. But with the considerable attention and the constant pressure on the swimming association, the centre couldn’t hold, and the sport collapsed. The then minister for sport Jim McDaid stopped funding to the IASA in 1998 and set up what was ultimately an unsatisfactory inquiry, where witnesses were not compelled to attend and many did not. The Murphy Report was subsequently published in June 1998 and soon after the IASA was replaced with Swim Ireland. For many, that was the end, or at least a new beginning. But not for all. Several Irish news outlets, including the Irish Star, RTÉ’s Prime Time and the Sunday Tribune made journeys to Colorado, California, and Florida. They upset the tempo of Gibney’s life and made it uncomfortable, but didn’t move the dial regarding him answering the allegations made against him in Ireland. In 2016, Justine McCarthy, author of Deep Deception – Ireland’s Swimming Scandals and now an Irish Times columnist, reported that the Garda gave a certificate of character to George Gibney to support his application for his American visa, dated and stamped January 20th, 1992. [ For over 30 years, George Gibney has lived as a free man, without having to face a trialOpens in new window ] From the Dáil, Independent TD Maureen O’Sullivan pressed home the need for a concerted approach from the police in Hillsborough County in Florida, where Gibney lived, and the Garda in Ireland. O’Sullivan’s letters followed the work of investigative journalist Irv Muchnick at the end of 2017. He had gone to the Californian courts in his case, Irvin Muchnick v United States Department of Homeland Security, seeking details of how Gibney had come to be in the US. He asked who had helped him with employment, who had written letters of comfort, and why, given his past, he had been allowed to remain a long-time resident alien in the country. Nobody knows exactly how much pressure the reporting, the door-stepping, court hearings in the US and letter writing to their congressional members put on the Irish State to act. In February 2018, The Second Captains released a 40-minute podcast called The George Gibney Case: 25 Years On. “The greatest illusion that was perpetrated in sport ever. There was nothing about that man that was real,” said O’Toole about his former coach Gibney. Second Captains producer Mark Horgan used the quote when he wrote a piece in The Irish Times in 2020 before the release of the 10-part podcast series Where is George Gibney? The big reaction to the 2018 piece pointed to real interest in the Gibney case and prompted them to consider a greater interrogation of the story. When Dylan Haskins, the commissioning executive for podcasts with BBC Sounds, was sold the idea for something more extensive and investigative, Horgan and Ciaran Cassidy hit the road. On and off for two-and-a-half years the pair travelled across the US, where they tracked down people who had previously stayed silent. They discovered new information on Gibney’s past and the path to where he resided in Florida’s Seminole county. During one of their visits to Florida, Horgan and Cassidy confronted Gibney outside his home. But he wouldn’t talk to them, wouldn’t listen, and awkwardly got into his car and drove away. “You couldn’t shut him up,” said Horgan. “That was, until the day he decided he’d never speak publicly again.” The silence and the voiceless shuffling of Gibney as questions were barked at him reached the ears of those swimmers who had not been part of the original 1990s case. Four came forward to make statements to gardaí alleging Gibney had sexually abused them between 1971 and 1981. By 2021, with the statements gathered, detectives at the Sexual Crime Management Unit had a criminal investigation and in May 2023 a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It directed that Gibney should face trial on 79 criminal charges; one charge of attempted rape and 78 of indecent assault. In the coming months, the outcome of the extradition and legal process in Ireland will be known. But already the four women who have made the allegations have gifted something those who went before them, something they have not had for many years. They have given them hope. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elizabeth Plunkett: How murdered woman’s family discovered they were not ‘relevant victims’ in serial killer case

When something false is repeated often enough, it has a tendency to become accepted fact. At some point a seed of incorrect information takes root in the public discourse before spreading through newspaper articles, books and political statements. Eventually, the actual truth becomes almost impossible to discern. It is a phenomenon known to researchers as the illusory truth effect. The family of Elizabeth Plunkett came face to face with this effect in 2023 after getting a call from the Parole Board. Elizabeth was a 23-year-old woman from Ringsend in Dublin who, in 1976, was kidnapped and murdered by two English men. The killers, John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans, had come to Ireland with the aim of murdering one woman every week. A month after Elizabeth’s death, they murdered another young woman, Mary Duffy, from Co Galway, before being caught by gardaí and confessing to their crimes. Shaw and Evans became known as Ireland’s first serial killers. Both received life sentences and Evans died in custody in 2012 at the age of 72. Shaw (78) remains in Arbour Hill Prison. He is Ireland’s longest-serving prisoner. He sought to change that in 2023 by applying for parole, having already been granted release for two days a year. Under a new parole act passed in 2019, the Plunkett family had an automatic right to express their views on Shaw’s parole bid. When the family were contacted by the Parole Board, it was decided two of Elizabeth’s sisters, Bernadette Barry and Kathleen Nolan, would speak for all of the siblings. They spent hours drafting their submissions, explaining the ongoing trauma of Elizabeth’s murder and the effect it had on their parents who both died a few years afterwards. Shaw should not be released under any circumstances, they said. “I poured my heart and soul into that,” said Kathleen this week. “It was like slicing me open, with the trauma of remembering.” They repeated the process later in person during a meeting with two members of the Parole Board who would decide Shaw’s future. “We got emotional, we got angry – it was gruelling,” recalled Bernadette. Afterwards, the family put the matter to the back of their minds and prepared for the wedding of Kathleen’s daughter that summer. That August, the sisters got a call from the solicitors representing them in the parole process and were asked to come into the office on a Saturday morning. Their solicitor, James McGuill, informed them that the Parole Board had made a serious mistake. It had been discovered the Plunkett family were not “relevant victims” and therefore had no right to take part in Shaw’s parole process. This was because Shaw had in fact never been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder. Bernadette and Kathleen could not believe what they were hearing. For decades, newspaper articles and books had repeated the same “fact”: that John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans – “Ireland’s first serial killers” – were serving life for the murders of Elizabeth Plunkett and Mary Duffy. More than that, various State agencies were under the same impression. Over the years, every time Shaw or Evans was moved out of the prison, for example for hospital appointments, the Irish Prison Service (IPS) contacted the Plunkett family “as relevant victims” to let them know. Similarly, the Parole Board had contacted the family in the belief that Shaw had been convicted of Elizabeth’s murder, only to realise belatedly its mistake. “There’s retired judges on the Parole Board,” said Kathleen. “The highest echelons of Irish society get these jobs on these boards. They’re highly educated people, and yet no one checked this out.” How did this illusory truth take hold? A look through the archives provides a few clues. Shaw and Evans confessed to raping and murdering both women shortly after their capture. However, the prosecution was a convoluted affair. First, a judge granted a defence application that the men be tried separately, as each one was blaming the other for the murders. For reasons that remain unclear, the judge also ordered the men be given separate trials for each of the murdered women, meaning a total of four trials. The hearing began in July 1977, when Shaw went on trial for Mary Duffy’s rape and murder. To the surprise of many onlookers the jury became deadlocked on a verdict. He was retried and subsequently convicted. [ The late summer murders: Two men on a mission to kill Irish womenOpens in new window ] The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) then successfully appealed the original judgment mandating separate trials, meaning they could try Evans for both of the murders at the same time. Following the trial, he was convicted of Mary Duffy’s murder but, for reasons that are also unclear at this remove, the judge ordered the jury to find him not guilty of Elizabeth Plunkett’s killing. Both men were sentenced to life for Mary Duffy’s murder. Then, in 1979, the DPP dropped the charges against Shaw relating to Elizabeth’s rape and murder. To date, nothing has emerged to explain this decision. It is possible the DPP believed Shaw would never be released so there was no point in going through the expense of another trial. Like the rest of Irish society, Bernadette and Elizabeth, who were teenagers at the time, went through their life believing Shaw was in prison for their sister’s murder. They explained that during the trials, their father went to great lengths to shield the family from the trauma of the process. “The way it was in the house, it wasn’t discussed. My father would just shut down any conversation about it because it set my Mammy off. It was all about trying to keep us together because we were all ready to just lose the plot,” said Bernadette. “When you see somebody going to jail and there was a court case, you just automatically live your life thinking, yeah, they were found guilty,” said Kathleen. After being informed about the Parole Board’s mistake in August 2023, the sisters decided they would refuse to accept the label of “not relevant victims”. Their solicitor hired two barristers to examine the case. After searching through the records, the lawyers found that not only had there been no conviction for Elizabeth’s murder, no inquest had been held either. It would later emerge that a death certificate had not even been issued for the young woman. It felt like Elizabeth had been erased, the sisters said, and they were determined to address that. The sisters wrote to the Garda, the DPP and the Government but got nowhere. At that point they decided to go public and made contact with the RTÉ Documentary on One team, having been impressed by their investigation into abuse in Blackrock College. “I said to Kathleen: they’re meticulous. They have to be. Because they can’t afford to be sued after all the Ryan Tubridy thing,” joked Bernadette. The sisters have nothing but praise for the documentary team, and in particular its producer Liam O’Brien. Last month RTÉ started publishing a six-part podcast on the case called Stolen Sister. Earlier this year, thanks to the sisters’ campaign, an inquest was finally held into Elizabeth’s death which recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. However, officially, no one has been convicted of her death and the Plunkett family still have no say in Shaw’s parole. [ From the archive: State’s longest-serving prisoner in fresh bid to secure temporary releaseOpens in new window ] His last parole bid was rejected. He is expected to apply again early next year. James McGuill, their solicitor, has called on the Garda to reopen the murder investigation with a view to securing a murder conviction against Shaw. The Garda has said its investigation concluded in 1976 and the matter is one for the DPP. The family have received legal advice that, in rare cases, it is possible to reopen a case after charges are dropped. One path being pursued by McGuill and the two sisters is gathering enough new evidence to allow prosecutors to reopen the case. They have had some success to date. After the inquest, and particularly after the start of the RTÉ series, multiple women have come forward to say they believe they were also targeted by Shaw and Evans during the men’s 1976 crime spree. [ Eight women come forward with information on being targeted by 1976 killers of Elizabeth PlunkettOpens in new window ] This includes a woman who was knocked down by a car very close to where Elizabeth was abducted in Co Wicklow. These testimonies will be passed on to the Garda and DPP, McGuill said. Looking back, Kathleen says she can understand her father’s desire to protect them from the trial and why he “hid the newspapers behind the sideboard”. “When anyone would it bring up, he’d say: ‘Let Elizabeth Rest in peace’, because he couldn’t cope,” she said. Nevertheless, they are determined to keep up their campaign for Elizabeth’s case to be reopened by authorities. “They thought these two auld ones would just go away, said Bernadette. “But no, sorry, not when you’re fighting for your family.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: If Institutions Are Buying Why Isn’t The Bitcoin Price Going Up?

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Matt Crosby Bitcoin price not soaring despite institutional billions? Uncover why profit-taking and derivatives hold it back, with a breakout looming! ETF inflows and institutional purchases continue to climb, yet many investors are puzzled by the muted Bitcoin price action. With billions flowing into BTC, why aren’t we seeing the price explode to new highs? The reality is more nuanced than it first appears. Looking at the ETF cumulative inflows chart (excluding GBTC outflows), it’s clear that demand from institutional players has been robust. Since the most recent pullback in late March, net ETF inflows have climbed from roughly 527,000 BTC to over 630,000 BTC, an increase of around 100,000 BTC in under 3 months. These are significant numbers, yet the Bitcoin price has largely mainly drifted sideways since the start of 2025. It’s important to remember that not all ETF flows represent “institutional” buying in the purest sense. Many ETF purchases come from client allocations, for example, family offices or high-net-worth individuals using platforms like BlackRock. Still, these flows matter, and the steady accumulation is a positive driver for long-term supply and demand dynamics. Complementing ETF inflows, corporate treasury buying has also been strong, with (Micro)Strategy leading the charge. MSTR alone have seen their holdings have jumped from roughly 528,000 BTC to over 592,000 BTC in this year alone. Across all treasury companies tracked, total holdings now exceed 823,000 BTC, representing an astounding $86 billion in value. Despite this, many market participants feel underwhelmed by price action compared to prior cycles. But we must contextualize expectations: the BTC market cap is now in the multi-trillion-dollar range. The sheer scale of capital required to drive exponential moves today dwarfs previous cycles. Comparing this cycle to the 10x returns of earlier eras isn’t realistic. In truth, BTC has more than doubled from $40K at the time of ETF launch to recent levels above $110K, a still monumental achievement for a maturing asset class. To understand why Bitcoin prices haven’t surged even further, we must examine selling behavior. By analyzing HODL Waves data for 1-5 year bands, we can quantify long-term holder profit-taking. Over the past three months, more than 240,000 BTC from these older bands has been distributed to the market, nearly a quarter-million BTC in net outflows. This selling has largely counterbalanced institutional accumulation. Given that daily miner issuance still adds another ~450 BTC to the market, we see why price has struggled to break higher: the market is in a state of supply-demand equilibrium. Meanwhile, open interest on BTC derivatives markets has exploded. From under $5B less than 3 years ago to over $25B today. Many new participants prefer are opting to trade “paper BTC” on derivatives rather than buying spot BTC, which reduces the positive influence on price of increased market participants. There is however now reason for optimism. Long-term holder selling is now decelerating, with recent net outflows falling below 1,000 BTC per day, a substantial reduction from previous monthly averages just weeks ago. If institutional inflows remain steady and retail demand starts to awaken, even at levels seen earlier this cycle rather than extreme prior peaks, we could easily see another powerful leg higher. Past instances show that when retail flows surge from these levels, BTC can double in price within months. ETF inflows and treasury purchases are pouring billions of dollars into Bitcoin, but the muted Bitcoin price reaction makes perfect sense when viewed through the lens of supply and demand. Heavy profit-taking by long-term holders and growing derivatives speculation have balanced out the inflows. As long-term selling subsides and institutional buying continues, the stage is being set for the next bullish impulse. Whether we see the euphoric retail mania of prior cycles remains to be seen, but even modest retail inflows combined with current institutional demand could drive prices sharply higher sooner rather than later.

Fidelity outpaces BlackRock in ETF inflows, but broader BTC demand slump limits upside momentum. U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (exchange-traded funds) are back with a bang, posting the second daily inflow of $601.94 million on the 3rd of July. However, the Fidelity BTC ETF fund (FBTC) has recently seen more aggressive demand than BlackRock’s IBIT. In fact, at press time, FBTC led inflows with $237.13 million, compared to IBIT’s $224.53 million, SoSo data showed. On the 2nd of July, FBTC also dominated the BTC ETFs, attracting $183 million of the overall $408 million inflows seen on that trading day. Source: SoSo Value Since Q2, the sustained inflows into FBTC have increased its holdings to 199,493 BTC as of 4th of July. This translates to $22 billion worth of net assets per current prices and 1.02% of the total BTC supply of 21 million coins. Fidelity’s BTC ETF growth is part of a broader surge in institutional accumulation from Q2. Notably, ETFs scooped 111,411 BTC in Q2, increasing their overall BTC stash by 8%. But public corporate treasuries, led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), bought more BTC (131K BTC) and grew their BTC stash by 18%. On the ETF side, Fidelity was second only to BlackRock’s IBIT in terms of total BTC holdings. IBIT had 692,887 BTC or 3.3% of the total BTC supply, as of the 4th of July. However, according to Fintel data compiled by AMBCrypto, IBIT saw higher institutional holder growth of 9% compared to FBTC’s 2.6% in early Q3. It meant more major institutional players like hedge funds and endowments piled on BlackRock than Fidelity. Source: Fintel However, overall share-holdings and capital allocation were down in early Q3, suggesting a trimmed position likely linked to recent quarter-end rebalancing or diversification. That said, the strong demand from ETFs and public treasuries has not managed to juice up the broader spot market demand. According to CryptoQuant, the apparent demand has dropped to 857K BTC despite ETFs and Strategy buying 748K BTC. Per the analytics firm, the broader contraction could cap BTC upside in the short term. “ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of Bitcoin demand; overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases, and the acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies.” Source: CryptoQuant As a result, CryptoQuant stated that although ETFs and Strategy’s buys were positive, they ‘are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs.’ The asset was valued at $108.8K, at press time, after tagging $110.5k on the 3rd of July.

Photo / Getty Images THE FACTS New Zealand company directors take note: European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. In truth, the Europeans have had their collective ass handed to them by Donald Trump. The US President has strong-armed Nato members into increasing their defence budgets to 5% of GDP. However, the Europeans are determined their increased expenditure should boost their own defence companies – not simply be used to buy American military hardware and boost the profits of those American companies contributing to the US war machine. Back here, New Zealand companies have devoted thousands of pages in successive annual reports to trumpeting their prowess on environmental, social and governance metrics (traditional ESG). Some are required by law. Some frankly fall into “feel-good” box-ticking (often notable among failing companies!) and a deflection from a company’s true commercial driver, which is to post a profit and stay in business. It is time for a rethink. As with DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies, which even BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink (a previous champion) has walked away from, there is a sharpening of focus. At the Amsterdam Stock Exchange last week, chief executive René van Vlerken was quick to emphasise that the heightened geopolitical risks – obvious on Europe’s backdoor where the Russian-Ukraine conflict verges on a “forever war” – has made for the more existential approach. The Amsterdam exchange is part of the pan-European stock exchange Euronext, which operates regulated exchanges in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Portugal as well as the Netherlands. In May, Euronext’s chief executive and chairman Stephane Boujnah said the redefinition of ESG was in response to a “new geopolitical order”. “European aerospace and defence companies have expressed the urgent need to invest heavily in their innovation and production capacities to guarantee Europe’s strategic autonomy for the next decade,” Boujnah said. Euronext said it would revisit the methodologies for ESG indexes to limit the exclusions currently placed on defence companies. This poses a challenge for traditional ESG ratings agencies when it comes to advertising investments in defence industry-related bonds (for instance). It also has ramifications for entities like the New Zealand Super Fund and KiwiSaver funds, which walk a tightrope on definitions of ethical investing, with all sorts of activists getting exercised over where the funds invest. How will funds approach investing in New Zealand companies ranging from aerospace to quantum computing or drone manufacturing – all within the scope of the Government’s new defence plans – when there is a clear implication their products will be used in armed conflict? Euronext has said it will encourage the rating agencies to restrict the concept of controversial weapons solely to armament activities prohibited by relevant international treaties. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. I was in the Netherlands with 40 business leaders on the New Zealand Initiative think tank’s Go Dutch study tour, which was designed to provide insights from small, advanced economies. Fortuitously, our time in the Netherlands coincided with the Nato Summit in the Hague. It also coincided with the US attack on three nuclear facilities in Iran with “bunker buster” bombs and Tomahawk missiles, which made for frantic rebooking of flights back to New Zealand after some airlines pulled back from flying over the Middle East. Trump did attend Nato, being hosted overnight by the Dutch King and Queen in their personal palace before a truncated Nato meeting. At the summit, the allies made a commitment to investing 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements and defence and security-related spending by 2035. At least 3.5% of GDP was to fit within agreed definitions of Nato defence expenditure to resource core defence requirements and to meet Nato’s Capability Targets. The other 1.5% was to be invested in protecting critical infrastructure; defending networks; ensuring civil preparedness, resilience and innovation; and strengthening the defence industrial base. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was also in the Netherlands. He was the only political leader from the Indo-Pacific Four – Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand – to attend the Nato Summit. It was noted that he had turned up. Luxon contends he was under no pressure to increase New Zealand’s defence spending above the targeted 2% of GDP within the decade that was outlined in the recent Budget. But this is a more dangerous world. It was notable that when we visited Rotterdam – which hosts Europe’s largest port and some fully-automated container terminals – that the Dutch Ministry of Defence wants to acquire terminal capacity for handling multiple ships carrying military cargo (mainly equipment and ammunition) simultaneously. It has been agreed within Nato that this type of cargo can be transported via the Netherlands, even if the destination is outside the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, where older Dutch people still hold sharply to the lessons from the Nazi occupation in World War II – and where they have more recently been hurt by soaring energy prices sparked by the withdrawal of Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine – there is a quiet confidence. With 26% of land under sea level, the Netherlands has developed extensive water management systems, including dikes, dams and polders (land reclaimed from the sea) to manage the obvious risk. There is a frank realism there – we could do with a bit more here. Disclaimer: Fran O’Sullivan met her own costs to take part in the New Zealand Initiative’s Go Dutch study tour. These are her views.

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 12:30:55 PM PDT by thegagline The Trump administration plans to implement a process whereby farmers in Iowa can vouch for hard-working, law-abiding migrant farmworkers who may be facing deportation, so that they can remain in the U.S. The proposed process was shared by President Donald Trump during an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Thursday night, kicking off a year of patriotic celebrations meant to honor the nation’s 250th birthday. Trump said the new plan will take place in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and that legislation for the measure is currently being drafted while speaking Thursday evening from Iowa. “You know, they’ve had people working for them for years. And we’re going to do something … we’re going to sort of put the farmers in charge,” Trump told the crowd of people in attendance. “If a farmer has been with one of these people that worked so hard – they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that, but they work very hard, and they know him very well, and some of the farmers are literally, you know, they cry when they see this happen – if a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristie, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” “We don’t want to do [border security] where we take all of the workers off the farms,” Trump added. “We want the farms to do great.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Title: Nvidia becomes most valuable company ever at $3.92T, leaving Microsoft and Apple behind

The surge of Nvidia's market value is fueled by the AI race, as lot of companies are fighting over a share of the AI reserves, Nvidia is simply supplying weapons to all sides of the war. Though Nvidia has many AI models of its own, it isn't targeting endpoint consumers or making chatbots for everyday use. One of Nvidia's models, Nemotron‑4 (340B), is used to generate synthetic data used for training LLMs. Thanks to the increasing competition among tech giants to build the most advanced AI data centers, train cutting-edge models, and dominate the sector, Nvidia is cashing in. It supplies most of the chips used for these purposes. Just 2 weeks ago, Nvidia became the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.34 trillion. Hitting this new all-time high represents a ~17.4% growth from the $3.34 trillion market value we reported about 2 weeks ago. Unless the AI race slows down, Team Green is likely to keep seeing green. Fun fact: The world’s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, manages over $11.5 trillion in assets but has a market value of about $182.6 billion. CompaniesMarketCap.com

Title: The Graduate: A Slick BMW Boxer Bobber Built From R65 and R100 Parts
URL: https://www.bikeexif.com/bmw-boxer-bobber
Time Published: 2025-07-04T17:01:01Z
Full Content:
You might not know Sam Clercx’s name, but you’ve seen his work. He launched his career at the tender age of 15 as an intern at Ironwood Motorcycles, under the guidance of Arjan van den Boom. He’s had a hand in many of the amazing machines that have graced our pages—and he’s learned a thing or two, judging by this beautifully executed BMW boxer bobber. “I was there with Arjan when he built the Mutant, and most of the other BMWs that put Ironwood on the map,” Sam tells us. “It was an extremely exciting time for me, as you can imagine. Most of my friends had jobs in supermarkets or cafés and I was helping build these amazing-looking and sounding custom bikes.” The niggles associated with classic motorcycles are partly why meneer van den Boom hit pause on Ironwood a few years ago. But Sam still has an affinity for the beloved BMW boxer motor. So he built up this R65 basket case as a side project, while completing another internship—this time at Motoism in Munich. “After Arjan closed up his shop and stopped building his boxers, I got a chance to buy a 1979 BMW R65 in parts, for cheap,” says Sam. “Thanks, in part, to Arjan and other people building wonderful machines out of these old R-series BMWs, the prices rose significantly, putting a nice riding rolling base out of my price range. I grabbed the opportunity and slowly started envisioning my perfect twin-valve custom.” “With a tight budget, but plenty of time, I picked up the neglected R65 in boxes. The short R65 frame and swingarm, paired with R100 cylinders, pistons, and heads, offered an affordable path to the quick, agile airhead I always wanted.” In stock form, the R100 makes about 25 hp more than the R65—so rebuilding the engine with R100 parts was a good call on Sam’s part. He also added BMW R100RS badges to the engine block to tease the engine’s true capacity, and adorned the heads with classic peanut covers. The airbox was swapped for pod filters, and the space it left behind was filled with a 3D-printed cover, housing a NOCO NLP9 battery. Sam scalped more R100 parts for the front end, fitting the lowered forks and twin Brembo brakes from a BMW R100RS. The R65 retains its drum brake and snowflake rims, which are now shod with Shinko E-270 tires. “It was a great help throughout the build to have a lot of spare parts from Arjan sitting in my garage,” he adds. “Small stuff like seals, throttle cables, and a lot of wiring—but also some nice bling parts.” A pair of aftermarket shocks props up the rear, connected to a custom-made stepped subframe. Lower down, the unsightly brackets that normally hold the mufflers and passenger pegs were trimmed down, leaving just enough space for the latter. “While style was obviously important, I didn’t want to sacrifice function,” Sam adds. “There are, of course, more practical bikes out there, but I set out to strike a balance between function and form: keeping it a two-seater and asking the talented Tom Hurley to make the seat as comfortable and waterproof as possible, while keeping it slim; adding tie-down points under the seat for my luggage; and fitting modern LEDs for good visibility at night, along with reliable electronics. I’m a rider first and a builder second.” Keeping with this philosophy, Sam fabricated a pair of short fenders for the bike and protected the fork stanchions with fresh rubber boots. A chromed LED headlight sits out front, nailing the mix of classic style and modern reliability that Sam was after. The headlight is neatly tucked into a 3D-printed fairing that was inspired by the plug-and-play fork covers that Motoism produces. It includes integrated Motoism turn signals, with a tidy housing for a slim Motogadget Motoscope Mini speedo up top. Other Motogadget bits include the bike’s keyless RFID ignition, and the company’s mo.unit blue module, around which the whole bike was rewired. The fairing also helps to route the cockpit’s cables and houses, making for an uber-neat setup. Wide handlebars sport vintage-style grips, a MessnerMoto throttle, and modern push-buttons with internal wiring. Tarozzi foot controls round out the control package. Motoism’s influence is clear in the BMW’s rear lighting too. Sam designed and 3D-printed his own taillight housing, equipping it with powerful LED internals. The rear turn signals are Motoism parts too, but the bracket that holds them is a one-off. The boxer’s glorious two-into-one exhaust headers were created by Sam’s good friend Chiel Nipius (of Nius Moto). They’re matched to a Spark silencer to create an appropriately throaty rumble. The most striking thing about this BMW boxer bobber is how well judged every last part and finish is—from the refinished motor to the period-correct pin striping and blacked-out tank roundels. “The color scheme was inspired by a picture of a classic Porsche 356 convertible I found—black leather, chrome silver, and this stunning blue,” explains Sam. “It was perfectly executed by Royal Kustom Works on the tank, fenders, and front fairing.” Now that his BMW R65/R100 is complete, Sam plans to take it on a few trips before selling it to make way for the next project. But first, it’s being exhibited as his official graduation project at the Utrecht School of the Arts. If it were up to us, we’d give him full marks.

Title: I’m a retiree with $900k cash but no home. How do I make it last? - Mary Holm

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. There's no need for your 80s to be sad. Photo / 123RF Q: I am a twice-married woman of 70. I have not come out of either marriage settlement well. For six years now, I’ve been living with a friend in a large, comfortable home. However, it is not a great situation and I really need to be out of it. My problem is that I have three children with families who all live in the Auckland area, and I would like to be located so that I can see them easily. They all lived offshore for a long time and now they are all here. I am so lucky. I have all up around $1 million, although $100,000 is on loan to my daughter to enable her to buy a home. My only income is the pension (I guess you’ve heard this all before!), but I am hopeful of living these next few years as I would like to live. Clearly, my 80s look sad. I am English-born, lived in Australia and met my Kiwi husband and moved to NZ. My 20-year marriage ended, and five years later I met my second husband. We had a business together which was successful, but he mismanaged our funds (he being the only director) and then left to live a nomadic life! My circumstances need to be addressed. I do not know if renting is wise as I’d hate to continually move, and my money would only allow me to buy something tiny anywhere near my only family in NZ. Is there any solution to this? I have been harbouring this problem for far too long, and I must move on. A: Let’s set you on a more positive path – not just for now but for your future. There’s no need for your 80s or beyond to be sad. I think renting, rather than tying up your savings in a small property that doesn’t appeal to you, is the way to go. You’ve got $900,000 available now. If you plan to live on that from now until you’re 90, you could spend $45,000 a year – in addition to NZ Super - even if you were earning no return on the savings. But if you earn 3% a year, after fees and tax, you could spend $60,000 a year – or $5000 a month - according to an online regular withdrawal calculator. What about when you’re 90? Many people report they can live comfortably on just NZ Super at that stage – although they tend to be homeowners. But by then, it would surely be reasonable for your daughter to repay your $100,000 loan, which you could use to supplement your Super. There are a few issues to consider here: If you prefer to just put the lot in bank deposits, your return would probably average above 2% a year after tax, and you could spend $4500 a month. You can make this work! Footnote 1: Cash-poor retired homeowners might want to consider selling their homes and renting in much the same way. Many people wouldn’t dream of doing that. But they would have considerably more spending money. Footnote 2: In your story, there is a message for other women whose husbands run the money side of a joint business: Be involved. Please. Q: I write regarding last week’s letter about landlords being charitable for too long and needing to raise rents. Landlords need to remember that their market is individuals with limits on what they can pay in rent. These individuals are not a charity to support indigent landlords. Of course, landlords can raise rents, but they may not find tenants. I see this in the apartment block where I own my home. Rents range from $500 per week for a studio to $750 for a two-bedroom. Lovely tenants moved out because the landlord raised the rent at lease renewal time. Apartments have been vacant for weeks until landlords got more realistic and reduced the asking price, in at least one case to below the previous rent. My renting neighbours are professionals on good incomes, the only people who can afford to rent here. I am a single superannuitant and could not afford to rent an apartment in my building. As an owner, my outgoings are around $6500 per annum, which I can afford. Obviously, a landlord’s outgoings also include mortgage repayments. But with the substantial rents my neighbours pay, I am surprised that landlords can’t cover their costs, particularly now that interest is tax-deductible. Possibly some landlords didn’t look carefully at risks and returns and are too highly geared, but I don’t see why tenants should pay for landlords’ poor business decisions. A: Your observations are interesting. A key factor in how well a rental property investment works for the landlord is the size of their mortgage. With no mortgage, most rents would easily cover expenses, but with a large mortgage, the interest payments can kill the short-term profitability. On the other hand, the bigger the mortgage, the bigger the long-term return the landlord stands to gain on their original investment – as long as property values rise. That’s the risk highly geared property investors take. Usually it works, or certainly has in the past. But if property values fall or stagnate, landlords with big mortgages they are struggling to pay are sometimes forced to sell at a loss. Expecting tenants to rescue them by paying rent above market rates is unrealistic. Q: You get lots of letters from landlords that focus on the social service they are doing by having properties that people can rent. There is no question that we need a stock of rental properties, but there are two points that many seem to miss. The first is that landlords, when they purchase properties to rent out, add demand to a limited supply of properties, and help raise the price. Secondly, when they threaten to leave the market, they will argue that there will be fewer properties for people to rent. That’s not true if the property is bought by another landlord. And if it’s bought by someone moving from rental to home ownership, then there is also one less person looking to rent. Unless they decide to leave the property vacant - highly unlikely - the total number of houses does not change when a landlord exits the market. A: You’re quite right on both points. If someone wants to own more than one house – so they can rent one property out – that must push up demand, and therefore prices. Several other readers also made your second point. One added that, if a previous tenant is able to buy a house from a landlord who has left the market, “from an overall societal perspective, this is a very good thing”. Also, she says, “I understand that the new healthy homes regulations are persuading some landlords to sell. Brilliant.” More on landlords and tenants next week. Q: Many years ago, I would read your weekly NZ Herald Q&A commentary (back in the days when the paper was known as conservative Granny Herald). Your bias against residential rental property was evident. You pushed for a capital gains tax and now quite possibly want a wealth tax in NZ. I also recall that your underlying views appeared to be somewhat socialist. Beyond this, I appreciate that you were giving advice to those who were not as financially literate as yourself. Over the many years my rental properties have appreciated in value, and now that, at retirement, I am mortgage-free, I have plenty of income and the benefit of capital gains. Also excellent long-term tenants and nicely renovated properties. Landlords have been particularly demonised in the last 10 or so years, and a culture of envy has developed against those who work to get ahead. We now have so many on a benefit (including NZ Super) that we have become unproductive as a nation. So the few work hard to support those who either don’t want to work or who can’t. I chanced upon an item online from your column back on February 24 last year asking the question, “Should we, the uber-rich and ‘chauffeured’!, be retiring ... at 85!” - whilst I was researching how I can financially help family by setting up a super fund for them, here and in Oz. Surely you are taking the mickey and invented this story? Otherwise, the couple must have dementia or cognitive impairment to write this nonsense to you. If, by some stretch of the imagination, there was some truth to what this couple wrote, the only purpose in publishing it was to engender envy and hatred, or dismay at best. It is great to stir the pot of green envy in NZ, as the left need the support of their “besties”, the media, including columns like yours, to further their agenda. Also, no wonder trust in the media, as revealed in recent polls, is at an all-time low, including distrust of our institutions and politicians, who also introduce legislation by stealth. Not to mention experts whose comments are all “politicised” today, and a left-biased judiciary and universities. Constant cherry-picking, an unbalanced distortion of the facts, running to their own narrative and pushing their agenda. There are still more than a few of us who are immune to all the propaganda and were educated in free thought. I do fear many will be departing our shores, though, given the push to greater socialism and redistribution of wealth in this country, and the racial divisions and subsequent erosion of democracy. A: Gosh. It must be hard being unhappy with beneficiaries, people who get NZ Super, the media, institutions and politicians, the judiciary and universities. You’ve well and truly broken the 200-word limit for letters, but you raise some interesting points. My comments: You acknowledge that some people can’t work. Along with setting up financial help for your family, it would be wonderful if you donated to charities that support these people. It might make you happier – I mean that sincerely. * Mary Holm, ONZM, is a freelance journalist, a seminar presenter and a bestselling author on personal finance.

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Several of the large banking institutions in the US passed the Stress Tests imposed by the Federal Reserve. As a result, they announced their intentions to raise dividends and boost buyback allocations. I went through the list of increases from last week, and focused on the institutions that have a ten year track record of annual dividend increases: I also added ten year charts showcasing the trends in share price, quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends. In order to understand equity returns, you need to decompose them to their sources. Equity returns are a function of: 1. Dividend Yields 2. Earnings Per Share Growth 3. Change in valuation In the long-run, the first two items (dividends and earnings per share) are the so called fundamental sources of returns. They drive the total return over periods longer than say a decade. The changes of valuation matter the least in the very long-run. In the short-run however, for periods of five to ten years or less, valuation does matter a lot. This is why your returns would be much different if you bought a company at a starting yield of 4% versus a starting yield of 2%. That being said, rising earnings and dividends matter a lot too, because they provide the needed fuel behind great returns in the long-run. However, if you manage to acquire a good company at a discount, your potential returns will be higher. Visualizing the interplay between dividend yields, earnings per share growth and the changes in valuation showcases where returns have come from perfectly well. It also provides the perspective to determine where we are today, and also to potentially provide some markers as to where a potential future buy point could be set at.

All portfolio trades were executed with global reinsurance companies and top-tier Lloyd's of London syndicates, and were sourced through the top three global reinsurance brokers. MCM Fund I opens access to reinsurance income for a rapidly expanding capital base of new investors seeking diversified and uncorrelated investment alternatives with attractive yield and structured liquidity. The launch represents the growing importance of funds structuring their offerings to take advantage of the continuing convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Backed by Solana, Aptos, and Cardano and supported by institutions like Coinbase, Archax, Apex Group, and Envelop Risk, MembersCap has selected the Solana, Aptos, Cardano, and Base protocols to provide access to qualified investors wishing to invest using eligible cryptocurrencies. MembersCap has been selected as the first fund in the real-world assets category on the Archax platform, sitting alongside tokenized offerings from other institutions like BlackRock, State Street, and Aberdeen. The reinsurance opportunity Being fundamentally uncorrelated with the financial markets, reinsurance has consistently outperformed most traditional alternatives over the past two decades. Despite being highly yield-generative, the sector has historically been reserved for pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional giants. Increasingly, both crypto-native investors and smaller traditional allocators are seeking refuge from market volatility by accessing reinsurance as a stable, diversified income stream to support a balanced portfolio and enhance overall returns. "Every generation is presented with new technologies that unlock economic opportunity. To us, tokenisation and the blockchain represent access to better asset management for a different class of investor," said Lloyd Wahed, Co-Founder and CEO of MembersCap. "We're excited to be one of the first institutional funds to emerge from this space." "Our investors– digital asset institutions, family offices, HNWIs —want to meet their goals of resiliency and long-term sustainable growth through new and more efficient means. With this novel approach, we're seeing these investors view reinsurance as a core part of their portfolio for the first time," said Patrick Barrett, Co-Founder and COO at MembersCap. "This launch proves that tokenisation can bring new capital to help address the growing insurance protection gap by lowering barriers and providing access to the private reinsurance market," said Dr. Benjamin Fox, Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer at MembersCap. "Our tokenised model enables a new cohort of investors to participate pari passu alongside large institutions in an uncorrelated asset class with a track record of reliable, attractive returns." Positioned as an alternative to private equity, venture capital, and fixed income strategies, MCM Fund I provides qualified investors with regulated and collateralised access to reinsurance via direct exposure to natural catastrophe and cyber reinsurance contracts sourced through blue-chip global partners. For Web3 treasuries, foundations, and institutions, the Fund delivers high-yield opportunities and structured liquidity, derived from high-quality, real-world reinsurance returns, without exposure to DeFi volatility and over-concentration in altcoins. MembersCap was founded in 2024 and is backed by a strong coalition of both institutional and blockchain-native partners. This blend of traditional underwriting expertise and on-chain architecture ensures institutional-grade standards while embracing next-generation accessibility. About Members Capital ManagementFounded in 2024, Members Capital Management ("MembersCap") is a licensed investment manager regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, bridging institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Backed by leading blockchain protocols including Cardano, Aptos, and Solana, and supported by institutional infrastructure from Archax, Coinbase, Apex Group and Envelop Risk, MembersCap delivers a new institutional blueprint: tokenised participation to the global reinsurance market, an asset class traditionally closed to most investors.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily It is the latest decision in favor of the Sandro and Maje parent company. PARIS — SMCP will get its shares back. The Singapore High Court has ruled that Dynamic Treasure Group must return the 15.5 percent stake it holds to European TopSoho, the parent company of SMCP, which had been transferred illegally. The court ordered that Dynamic Treasure Group has one week to return the shares, or appeal the decision. In a statement, the company said it will “keep the market informed about the effective completion of the return of this stake.” Related Articles Celebrity News Princess Beatrice Brings Understated Flair in Striped Sandro Look to First Day of Wimbledon 2025 Financial SMCP Sales Gain 2.6% in Q1 Amid Strategic Shift Away From China This is the latest twist and turn in a case stemming from 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital of Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot parent company SMCP “disappeared” from France and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. You May Also Like This follows a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. It’s also the second ruling in the case within a month as it winds through courts and regulators in multiple jurisdictions. In June, French regulatory body Autorieté des Marchés Financiers fined the company and its shareholders for a series of irregularities. First, the regulatory body sanctioned former majority shareholder European TopSoho, director of European TopSoho Chenran Qiu and Dynamic Treasure Group, which received the shares, for disclosure violations and market manipulation. The shares were moved from Luxembourg to the British Virgin Islands without notifying the authorities. They effectively “went missing” until they reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by Qiu, weeks later. European TopSoho had sold them to DTG for a symbolic one-euro price. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu was involved in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. As a result, the AMF issued a series of fines. Qiu was sanctioned with 1 million euros, European TopSoho 400,000 euros, and Dynamic Treasure Group 300,000 for a total of 1.7 million euros. Separately, the AMF fined SMCP 20,000 euros for an unrelated leak of their financial information in 2021, when it accidentally published quarterly results on its website before market close. The London-based GLAS is the trustee for European TopSoho creditors including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan that united to save the group with the issuance of bonds, and effectively SMCP’s largest shareholder. They announced last year their intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares. That move could trigger a mandatory takeover action under French law if a single purchaser snaps them up. SMCP has been on the road to recovery as it seeks to replace the market share it lost in China by expanding into new regions in Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia and India. It recruited former Loewe executive Kleine Tan to take up the role of chief executive officer of SMCP Asia in April, tasked with implementing the company’s “strategic road map in the region, notably our network optimization in China,” she said in a statement shared first with WWD at the time.

Title: World of Warcraft: What’s Up With the Collector’s Bounty?
URL: https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-collectors-bounty-july-legacy-content-1851785640
Time Published: 2025-07-04T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As part of the run-up to patch 11.2, Blizzard is closing out Season 2 of World of Warcraft: The War Within with a couple of special events. One of them is a buff called Collector’s Bounty which is aimed at transmog collectors and mount farmers. Here’s what you might want to know before you jump in. There’s been some confusion about how Collector’s Bounty works. It was implemented on July 1 after the weekly reset, but took a couple of hours to kick in. Its effects were initially invisible. Now every character who logs into a modern TWW server will receive Collector’s Bounty on entry into the world. While this buff persists, bosses in every dungeon and raid instance in “legacy content” (any expansion before Dragonflight), drops double the normal loot. In dungeons, this typically means four to six items, while raid bosses can drop up to 12 depending on the raid’s difficulty setting. Anecdotally, it also seems as if dungeon monsters have a greater chance to drop green- and blue-quality items. This is a great opportunity to hunt down any transmogrification items you’ve been missing. (Personally, I use the AllTheThings add-on to track my collection, which is why my tooltips are slightly longer than usual). Further, several specific items, such as rare mounts and legendary weapons, have a +5 percent chance to drop during Collector’s Bounty. This is 10 times their usual drop rate, and some obsessed players have been trying to get them for actual calendar years. Maybe now’s their chance. Specific items affected by Collector’s Bounty include: Note: While not specifically affected by Collector’s Bounty, SoO has a few secret transmogrification items as boss drops, such as the Kor’kron Dark Shaman set and Mannoroth’s Tusks, that should be easier to farm now. In addition, keep an eye out for two high-demand cosmetic weapon drops from Antorus. Aggramar’s flaming sword Taeshalach has been a popular transmogrification option since Legion came out, and Argus has a low chance to drop his scythe. While anyone in Champion-track TWW gear or better should blast through most BfA content like it isn’t there, this is also where raid encounter design can get a bit tricky. For example, the Stormwall Blockade encounter in Dazar’lor has an instant kill built into it if you don’t interrupt Catastrophic Tides in time. (If you’re a warlock, make sure your felhunter is out.) The entrance to Ny’alotha can appear in either Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms depending on where the Black Empire is attacking in a given week. You can solo N’Zoth these days without the old BfA legendary cloak, but at current TWW gear levels, you cannot simply burst N’Zoth hard enough to ignore his central mechanics. You’ll need to enter his Mindgates and reclaim your Severed Consciousness or you’ll simply drop dead. While there are a couple of ways to reach various parts of the Shadowlands without having to go through its introductory sequence, you’ll typically end up out of phase with most of the features and characters. To get into places like the Maw or Zereth Mortis on a new character, you’ll need to start their introductory quests by talking to the Knights of Ebon Blade in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Like BfA, there are a few different bosses in Shadowlands with instant-kill gimmicks, particularly in mythic raids. While none of them have the firepower to really bother a level 80 character, given the stat inflation between this expansion and TWW, a few have abilities that can seriously ruin a solo raider’s day. Particular offenders here include the Jailer’s mind control, Soulrender Dormazain’s Warmonger Shackles, and Artificer Xy’mox’s Stasis Traps. Keep an eye on your dungeon journal. At time of writing, So’leah is also difficult to beat solo, as her dungeon gimmick gives her a massive damage reduction bonus that you can’t dispel without a team. You can either autoattack her for 10 minutes, bring friends, or use a level 80 monk’s Touch of Death to bypass her shields and drop her in one hit. Collector’s Bounty in World of Warcraft is currently planned to last until July 28. .

Friday, July 4th, 2025 Trading activity was thin towards the end of this week as the United States celebrates Independence Day – with a record-breaking 72 million people traveling – but both ICE Brent and WTI edged slightly lower on expectations of OPEC+ hiking production targets again in August. Whilst OPEC+’s Saturday meeting seems to be a rather predictable affair, next week’s big price moves will be dictated by the July 9 tariff deadline as Asian countries try their luck with last-minute negotiations with President Trump. OPEC+ Moves Its July Meeting a Day Ahead. Sticking to its policy of trying to surprise market watchers, the group of eight OPEC+ producers unwinding production cuts decided to move their meeting initially planned for July 6 to Saturday, in anticipation of yet another 411,000 b/d monthly output hike. Trading Giant Tries Its Luck with Last-Minute Bid. A consortium led by privately-held trading giant Vitol submitted an eleventh-hour bid for Venezuela-owned US refiner Citgo Petroleum, offering more than 10 billion for Citgo’s 807,000 b/d capacity for three refineries, the highest known offer in the ongoing auction. India Wants to Expand Strategic Reserves. The government of India has started feasibility studies on the construction of three new strategic petroleum storage sites, more than doubling the current 40-million-barrel SPR stock, placing a special emphasis on salt caverns in the northern state of Rajasthan. Exxon Returns Unused Guyana Acreage to State. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has returned 2,534 km2 (equivalent to 978 sq miles) of the Stabroek block offshore Guyana to the South American country’s government, relinquishing it after it didn’t manage to explore or develop those territories. BlackRock Comes to the Rescue. With Saudi Arabia expected to take on more debt this year after a $15.6 billion deficit in Q1, US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reportedly expressed interest in selling its stake in Saudi Aramco’s (TADAWUL:2222) natural gas pipeline network back to the NOC. China Eases Taxation on Embattled Teapots. The regional government of Shandong hiked fuel oil import tax rebates for independent refiners in the region, returning between 75% and 95% of payable consumption tax for gasoline and diesel as most ‘teapots’ barely survive at 50-55% utilization rates. Brazil Eyes More Exploration Money. Following a bumper revenue stream of 180 million from Brazil’s 5th Concession Offer bidding last month, the Latin American country now wants to hold an additional E&P auction to be organized in 2025 still for uncontracted pre-salt areas, eyeing higher budget revenue. Glencore Mulls Its Options with UK Refinery. Swiss-based global trading house Glencore (LON:GLEN) has been in talks with the UK government over the fate of the 113,000 b/d Lindsey refinery, caught in great turmoil after the insolvency of its operator Prax, as Glencore has been its exclusive crude supplier. Sanctions-Hit Venezuela Revisits China Dependence. Despite the Trump administration’s sanctions snapback on Venezuela, PDVSA’s exports of oil and refined products edged slightly higher in June to 844,000 b/d, however almost 90% of all flows are now moving towards China, a longtime ally. US Oil Drilling Wanes on Uncertain Outlook. According to the latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, oil and gas business activity in the US turned negative in Q2 2025 as the uncertainty index soared to 47.1, with almost half of companies expecting to drill fewer wells this year than initially expected. Japan Wants Fully-Fledged Carbon Trading by 2027. Japan launched discussions with domestic industry participants to kick-start its full-scale emissions trading system by 2027, mandating that all companies emitting more than 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 participate in ETS trading, a step up from the current voluntary market. Ecuador Declares Force Majeure on Oil Production. Ecuador’s state oil company Petroecuador declared force majeure on all its operations after the 360,000 b/d SOTE and 450,000 b/d OCP pipelines carrying crude from the country’s inner regions to the coast were damaged by landslides and erosion. Trump Admin Lifts Restrictions on China-Bound Ethane. The US Commerce Department rescinded its mandate for US ethane exporters to seek export licenses for deliveries to China, with both Enterprise and Energy Transfer confirming flows from the Morgan’s Point and Nederland terminals have fully resumed.

Title: Is Elon Musk Really Behind the Bitcoin Buzz This Time?

Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:56:08Z

The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility induced by Elon Musk. His tweets have historically caused major price swings. But as BTC flirts with fresh highs, the current rally is more data-driven—and the Tesla CEO’s role remains unconfirmed. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has achieved a historic milestone by closing the second quarter at its highest level ever, reaching $107,149 on the Bitstamp exchange. This performance follows an 11.6% decline in the first quarter, but Bitcoin rebounded with a 30% gain in the second quarter. Social metrics from LunarCrush and Santiment show a spike in Bitcoin-related engagement following a cryptic tweet from Musk on June 29. The post included a rocket emoji and a dollar symbol—enough to prompt a flurry of interpretations from the crypto community. However, no direct reference to Bitcoin was made. Analysts at CryptoQuant and Kaiko note that while social sentiment surged after the tweet, no significant wallet activity linked to Musk or Tesla has been reported. Bloomberg estimates that BlackRock IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI remains under 60, suggesting there’s room for more momentum. Price is holding above its 50-day ($105,970) and 200-day ($87,717) moving averages. Meanwhile, whale activity appears mixed. IntoTheBlock data shows a 45% drop in large BTC transactions over the past month, suggesting some cooling among high-net-worth traders. Still, BTC’s technical posture remains bullish. The network’s health and rising ETF demand suggest fundamental strength rather than hype-driven movement. While Elon Musk’s influence on the market remains a wildcard, current data suggests that his actions do not primarily drive Bitcoin’s momentum.

Title: Nvidia Briefly on Track to Become World's Most Valuable Company Ever
URL: https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/nvidia-on-track-worlds-most-valuable-company-ever-8825548
Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:39:29Z
Full Content:
Photo Credit: Reuters Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4 percent to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalization than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5 percent at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7 percent to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8 percent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 percent from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalization underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7 percent of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28 percent of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

DeFi Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “DeFi Technologies”) (Nasdaq: DEFT) (CBOE CA: DEFI) (GR: R9B), a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (“DeFi”), has announced its expansion in the GCC and MENA region with the registration of DEFI DMCC (certification no DMCC199558) with offices in Jumeirah Lake Towers Dubai UAE. 0 04 July 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour, and Valour Digital Securities Limited (and, together with Valour Inc., “Valour”) a leading issuer of exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) has also opened a trading desk at DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Center) in UAE. The DeFi Technologies team and its subsidiary Valour, aim to support the increased institutional interest in digital assets in the GCC region and specifically in the UAE. This expansion into the Middle East is a key element of the strategy to increase product offerings and global footprint. As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy through its integrated and scalable business model. This includes Valour, which offers access to more than 65 of the world’s most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs with plans to offer 100 by the end of 2025. With regulatory momentum, product velocity, and institutional credibility converging, DEFT is positioning itself as the BlackRock of Web3. Globally, institutional capital is pouring into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and in the Middle East and in the UAE in specific this is also becoming a trend. Recently, UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announced it expanded its position in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF showcasing the latest example of institutions increasingly turning to non-traditional exposures wrapped in an ETF. Bitcoin ETPs are facilitating greater exposure for investors who had been interested in crypto but want a familiar and efficient wrapper. Currently, total assets under management (“AUM”) in crypto ETPs have reached $176.3 billion. Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour, stated, “ We believe the demand for digital asset ETPs will increase not only globally but in the GCC and Middle East. Investors whether sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, family offices and even retail investors are interested in crypto but require familiar and efficient vehicles to get exposure.” He adds, “Wrapping digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated financial instruments such as ETPs will increase the number of crypto investors and offer countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia access to international foreign investment. Local and international get exposure to these assets through trusted providers like the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, Dubai Financial Markets, and others.” Already DeFi Technologies has expanded into Turkey through a collaboration with Misyon Bank, and Misyon Kripto to work to introduce ETPs. In Turkey currently over 50% of investor population are holding digital assets. In 2024, DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour partnered with GulfCap Investment Bank (“GCIB”), a licensed investment bank as its key Transaction Advisor for the proposed cross-listing of Valour’s ETPs on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) in Kenya. The proposed cross-listing will allow Valour’s ETPs to be traded in Kenyan Shillings on the NSE and provide investors in East Africa with exposure to leading digital assets through regulated investment vehicles. In Europe DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour currently offers 65+ fully hedged digital asset ETPs on leading European exchanges including Xetra, Spotlight, and Euronext.

Title: One of America's most important companies slashes 20,000 jobs and offers huge buyouts

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/04/2025 5:44:20 AM PDT by DFG UPS is offering voluntary buyouts to its full-time US drivers following its decision to slash 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities. The Atlanta-based company will be providing its laid off employees with various benefits, including pensions and healthcare. The layoffs are part of UPS's network configuration plan, which also confirms the upcoming closures of over 90 more facilities in the future. The changes are part of the company's $3.5 billion cost reduction target for 2025, aiming to reach a 12 percent US operational margin by next year. UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then.

The layoffs are part of UPS's network configuration plan, which also confirms the upcoming closures of over 90 more facilities in the future. The changes are part of the company's $3.5 billion cost reduction target for 2025, aiming to reach a 12 percent US operational margin by next year. UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

UPS, which is one of the largest parcel delivery companies in the US, currently has 490,000 employees, around 330,000 of which are represented by the Teamsters union. The union was the first to announce the buyout, calling it an 'illegal violation' of the national contract in which UPS committed to create 22,500 jobs. 'Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

For one thing they have a lot of competition, so they are by no means a bell weather. Many, many years ago, like almost 60 years, I worked at a place that got deliveries and shipped stuff as well. Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then. Well, a few years later, he was out of a job, and the company he worked for was out of business. That company was known as REA… Railroad Express Agency. I think there is a lesson there. 20 posted on 07/04/2025 7:59:33 AM PDT by Ditto [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments,' said Sean O'Brien, general president of the union. The announcement comes months after UPS decided to halve the number of Amazon deliveries it takes before tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump took effect. Deliveries for the e-commerce giant make up around 12 percent of UPS's revenue. The company concluded that its profit margins from Amazon deliveries profit were too small, and it wanted to focus on other markets like healthcare and international deliveries. 'The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,' said CEO Carol Tomé. Prior to these massive layoffs, UPS axed 12,000 employees and closed 11 facilities last year after its income declined by $1.87 billion due to its 'disappointing year' in 2023.

Every day, the delivery driver from the company, would show up, make his delivery, pick up a shipment and then proceed to pour himself a cup of coffee, and start talking to a woman there he had the hots for. The guy was in no hurry to leave and was totally ‘secure’ in his job because he was a union member. The company he worked for was the biggest shipping and delivery business in the world then.

In light of that, if it were me, those that can go should. They can always hire on with usps and do half the work for probably comparable pay. It sounds like the Teamsters hired a bunch of district court judges: “Young cannot do that!” Amazon deliveries are more reliable than UPS. My Prime shipments always get to me when Amazon delivers. FedEX and UPS are a mixed bag. The issue is a mix of 4 things - package theft, driver malfeasance or incompetence and shipper fraud. By delivering its own packages, Amazon has a handle on all four. When is Trump going to start laying off and deporting all these “dipstick rogue judges”? They are a bunch of out of control fascists that need to be gone.

July 04, 2025 08:08 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged toward its all-time high in recent weeks, adding around 50% since dropping to its April lows as crypto changes the game for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, which is braced for a “big” month ahead after the White House crypto czar teased a major update, has climbed to give bitcoin a total market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, with bullish traders predicting a looming bitcoin price boom. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that remain on the sidelines, bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to Congress she described as “groundbreaking.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has declared himself the first "crypto president," helping the bitcoin ... More price soar. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world,” Lummis said in a statement. The bill would see small crypto transactions of less than $300 exempt from taxes, as well as crypto lending, and defer taxes on income generated from crypto mining and staking until the coins are sold. It would also apply a typical 30-day wash rule to crypto, removing a loophole that has allowed crypto investors to sell at a loss only to buy back in again while still claiming a tax deduction. Lummis highlighted estimates from the congressional joint committee on taxation that estimated the bill would generate about $600 million through 2034. “We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” Lummis said. Lummis had tried to squeeze the crypto tax reforms into U.S. president Donald Trump’s so-called "one, big, beautiful" bill but ran out of time before the Senate sent it to the House. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, propelled by U.S. president Donald Trump's ... More return to the White House. Trump’s "one, big, beautiful bill," designed to overhaul the U.S. tax-and-spend landscape and power the country’s next phase of growth while adding an expected $3 trillion of debt and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, has been passed by the House of Representatives. House Republicans have meanwhile declared the week beginning July 14 "crypto week," in which policymakers will focus on three major crypto bills—the stablecoin Genius Act, the market structure Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC [central bank digital currency] Surveillance State Act. The Trump administration’s pro-bitcoin and crypto agenda has been named as a catalyst for a bitcoin price break out in coming months. “We expect bitcoin to print new all-time highs in the second half of the year, buoyed by growing ETF [exchange-traded fund] and corporate treasury flows, as well as U.S. policy and regulatory developments,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. Spot bitcoin ETFs, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, as well as so-called bitcoin treasury companies that have sprung up in the wake of Michael Saylor’s bitcoin-buying giant Strategy, have hoovered up more than $100 billion worth of bitcoin between them in the last few years.

The holiday season is make-or-break for many retailers, with Christmas marketing turning up the heat on sales and customer engagement. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported U.S. holiday (November-December) retail sales reached a record $994.1 billion in 2024, up 4% from 2023. That’s nearly $1 trillion of buying power in just two months. And about 55% of e‑commerce Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) is generated in the last two quarters of the year. With consumers ready to spend, it’s essential to have a solid plan in place. Here are 22 proven Christmas marketing ideas, complete with real examples and practical tips to help inspire impactful festive campaigns. Holiday shoppers behave differently from other times of year. Many start early: roughly 28% of consumers begin holiday shopping before Labor Day, and nearly 73% aim to have most gifts purchased by December. In other words, planning for Christmas Marketing should begin well in advance (late summer or early fall) to catch early-bird buyers. Mobile and social channels dominate this season: mobile devices generate 71% of digital traffic and 56% of orders during the holidays, while 89% of consumers say social media influences their holiday shopping. Moreover, festive campaigns also play by different rules than everyday promotions. Shoppers expect holiday-themed storytelling, festive visuals, and limited-time urgency. Campaigns that feel warm, joyful, and generous can cut through the clutter. As Subharun Mukherjee, Head of Marketing at CleverTap, notes in the Guide to Optimizing Massive Online Sales (OMOS) Events e-book: “Global online events are revolutionizing the e‑commerce landscape, with companies reporting their highest sales during the holiday season. During online sales events, customers are inundated with deals, discounts, and exclusive offers, making it even harder for businesses to differentiate themselves from the competition.” Merchants must align their Christmas marketing ideas with today’s realities: digital-first, mobile-optimized, and emotionally resonant campaigns that stand out in a crowded and competitive environment. Christmas marketing requires early, creative planning and strategies tuned to seasonal mindsets. With that in mind, here are 22 top Christmas marketing ideas to boost sales this holiday season: Run a “25 Days of Christmas” sale or advent-style countdown on your site. Feature a different deal or product each day and promote it via email marketing, SMS, and push notification. Daily surprises (e.g., flash discounts or bonus gifts) build excitement and urgency as Christmas approaches. You can use CleverTap for Christmas marketing to schedule automated push or in-app messages for each day’s offer, keeping users engaged with timed alerts. This approach gamifies shopping and drives repeat visits to see what’s next. Create themed gift bundles (e.g., “Holiday Wellness Kit” or “Winter Warmth Bundle”) that group complementary products with a special price. Bundles encourage customers to buy more in one order. Product bundles drive up the average order value (AOV) by encouraging customers to purchase more items in one go. For example, Apple’s holiday strategy includes exclusive bundles with premium services, targeting loyal users with limited-time offers, proving that even simple bundles can feel high-end with the right positioning. Source: KennyLee Creative Make the bundles feel exclusive (limited supply or exclusive items) and wrapped in festive packaging or imagery. For example, group best-selling items together or curate gifts around a theme like “Gifts for Her” or “Gourmet Food Basket.” CleverTap can help here by recommending bundles to customers based on their past purchases or browsing behavior, or by sending targeted emails promoting bundles to those who have shown interest in similar products. Occasionally run surprise flash sales or “lightning deals” on key days during Christmas marketing campaigns. Because these are on a very short deadline (hours or a day), they tap into shoppers’ fear of missing out (FOMO). Limited-time offers with a ticking clock get people to act fast. Promote flash sales aggressively: use site banners, social media posts, and especially SMS or push alerts to ensure customers see the deal immediately. CleverTap can orchestrate these multi-channel blasts, allowing you to reach email, push, and social channels simultaneously and follow up with reminders. Because timing is key, set up countdown timers on pages and send alerts at the sale’s midpoint and final hour. Offer free shipping on holiday orders (possibly with a minimum threshold) and emphasize hassle-free returns. Free shipping is one of the most powerful incentives: around 60% of shoppers will add extra items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping. Prominently advertise “Free Shipping” on banner ads, email subject lines, and product pages. Extend your return window as well, reassuring customers that any gifts that don’t fit can be returned in January at no additional cost. From an operational view, free returns are also important: 45% of consumers rank free return shipping as most important to them. Give your online store a seasonal look. Update homepage banners, product images, and CTAs with a holiday theme (think snowflakes, twinkling lights, or red-and-green color schemes). Change button text to holiday calls-to-action (“Shop Holiday Gifts” instead of “Shop Now”). These visual cues signal to visitors that they’re in a festive shopping environment. A themed site also feels fresh and can boost engagement. (Don’t forget holiday-specific SEO – e.g., update meta titles/descriptions to include keywords like “Christmas sale,” “holiday gifts,” etc.) Give your logo, product images, or packaging a limited-edition holiday twist. Even a slight seasonal makeover can make your brand more shareable on social. Iconic examples prove the power of this: Starbucks’ annual red holiday cup (introduced in 1997) became a cultural touchpoint signaling the start of the holiday season. Source: Forbes Similarly, Hershey’s Kisses added red-and-green foil wrappers and holiday ads, cementing their image as a holiday staple. Source: Herseyland You can do the same at your scale. Add Santa hats to your logo, wrap products in festive-themed boxes, or create holiday gift tags. When packaging looks gift-ready, customers are more likely to share photos on social media, amplifying your reach. Pick an overarching theme or narrative for your Christmas marketing. For example, run a “12 Days of Gifting” campaign, a Santa’s workshop theme, or a winter wonderland story. This theme should tie together your emails, social posts, ads, and on-site banners. For example, WestJet Airlines created a heartwarming “Christmas Miracle” narrative. They set up a video Santa to ask passengers what they wanted, then secretly bought everyone’s wishes and delivered the gifts on the baggage carousel. The whole event was filmed as a story and went massively viral (27+ million YouTube views in one week). Source: WestJet Christmas Miracle: Real-time Giving Story-driven campaigns make messaging cohesive and memorable. Each email or social post can continue the story (Day 1: “Santa’s stocking stuffers – 20% off!”; Day 2: “Elves’ favorite toys – buy one, get one”). A consistent theme reinforces your brand’s holiday voice. Craft a special holiday email series tailored to customer segments. Send promotional emails based on behavior: for instance, if a customer looked at winter coats, email them a curated gift guide of related items. If another customer was a frequent buyer last holiday, give them a VIP early access deal. Personalize subject lines (“[Name], unwrap your 20% off gift inside!”) and content by recipient. Segment your lists (e.g., “Frequent buyers”, “Browsers of category X”) and send each a custom holiday message. For example, you could send “Gifts for Tech Lovers” to gadget-seekers and “Gifts Under $50” to budget shoppers. For example, Travelodge’s festive email invited users to “Make a Wish This Christmas” for a chance to win a 2025 trip, combining seasonal visuals, interactive elements, and segmented travel suggestions by season. A smart blend of personalization and engagement to drive early bookings. Source: ReallyGoodEmails CleverTap’s email automation and segmentation make this easy: it can pull user attributes like past purchases or interest tags to populate email content and ensure each shopper sees relevant product suggestions. Leverage user-generated content with holiday-themed social media contests. For instance, challenge followers to share a photo of themselves with your product in a festive setting, using a branded holiday hashtag (e.g., #MyBrandGift). Or run a “12 Days of Christmas Wish List” challenge: each day, invite customers to comment with their holiday wishlist item from your store for a chance to win it. These interactive posts boost engagement and spread brand visibility. Encourage participants by offering small prizes (like a coupon code or free gift) for the best or most creative entry. Remember to repost the best entries on your own channels; it increases reach and adds authenticity. For example, Starbucks launched a #RedCupContest on Instagram where customers were invited to post creative photos of the seasonal red cup. One year, Starbucks received over 24,000 entries in just 5 days during the contest. Source: People Magazine Build fun, interactive web pages or microsites to engage visitors. Ideas include a “spin-the-wheel” discount game, a festive quiz (“Which Holiday Gift Suits You?”), or a digital advent calendar that reveals a coupon or product each day. Gamification can significantly boost engagement and conversions. In fact, research has found that 60% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a brand that includes a gamified experience, and conversion rates can jump up to 7X higher with game-like widgets. For example, a spin-to-win pop-up (“Spin Santa’s Wheel for Your Discount!”) rewards users with a random discount or freebie in exchange for an email signup. These interactive elements make shopping fun and encourage visitors to stay on your site longer. Sephora introduced a holiday “Gift Finder” quiz on its site. Visitors answer questions about the gift recipient and budget, and the quiz suggests products. They promoted the feature via Instagram and saw huge success. Source: Sephora Indonesia Capitalize on the popularity of short-form video. Create holiday-themed video content for ads and social reels (Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts). This could be a heartwarming story featuring your product as a gift, a quick demo of a holiday deal, or even a lighthearted Christmas jingle. Vertical videos with cheerful holiday music get high engagement on social feeds. For example, a restaurant might film quick clips of festive table settings and specials, or a clothing brand could showcase “Outfit ideas for Christmas parties” in a fast montage. Keep videos short (15–30 seconds) with a clear call to action (e.g., “Shop Now” or “Learn More”). Pair them with holiday hashtags and target them carefully using demographics/interests. Coca-Cola is a great example. Their 2024 “Share the Magic” holiday campaign had TikTok and Instagram influencers sharing personal holiday moments featuring Coca-Cola. They incorporated Coca-Cola’s iconic holiday assets (the vintage Santa, the red trucks) in these bite-sized videos to tap into nostalgia while reaching younger viewers on Reels. Source: Social Storis Publish curated gift guides targeted by shopper persona or recipient. For example: “Gifts for Him,” “Gifts for Kids,” “Gifts Under $25,” “Tech Lover’s Holiday Picks,” etc. Place these guides on your site or as separate landing pages, and link to them in your ads and emails. CleverTap can help personalize this even further. For instance, when a user in-app or on-site browses a category (say, beauty products), you could dynamically show the “Gifts for Her” guide as a suggested page. Gift guides not only simplify shopping, but they also give more exposure to your products. Send customers to the appropriate guide via segmented emails: e.g., email your fashion-loyal customers with “Holiday Style Gift Guide” and your gadget fans with “Best Tech Gifts.” This targeted approach can significantly increase conversions, since shoppers find gifts relevant to their needs. Wishlists make holiday shopping fun and viral: customers can build a list of items they want and easily send it to family and friends. Ensure your site or app supports sharing (via email, social media, or direct link) and display a “Most Wished For” carousel on your homepage. When someone shares a wishlist, you gain new potential customers (friends/family). Wishlists also give you valuable data about what people want. If a user adds an item to a wishlist, you could later send a reminder (“Hey, [Name], items on your wishlist are going fast – get 10% off them today!”). Following up with customers about items on their wishlist – especially if stock is low or a sale is ending – significantly boosts conversions. Amazon popularized this with its shareable Wish Lists. For the holidays, they even introduced a dedicated “Holiday Gift List” feature so families can aggregate gift ideas in one place and share the link around. Source: Amazon Reward and motivate customers who shop early. Offer an “early bird” discount or bonus gift for purchases made in October or early November. For example, a “Halloween to Black Friday” sale pass, or a limited-time code “EARLYXMAS” for 15% off purchases made by November 15. This not only drives early sales (helping you plan inventory and revenue) but also prevents waiting shoppers from drifting to competitors later. For Christmas marketing, CleverTap can identify customers who have previously purchased and automatically target them with these exclusive pre-holiday deals via push or email. Remind all subscribers with email campaigns highlighting inventory or shipping deadlines. Send customers a heartfelt holiday greeting (digital or even printed mailer) with a personalized touch and a coupon. A simple “Happy Holidays, and thank you for shopping with us” message can go a long way. Beyond just text, consider adding a small gift, such as a unique promo code or coupon, inside the card. This makes customers feel valued as individuals, not just revenue sources. With CleverTap’s Promos, you an make this happen easily. Handwritten notes or limited-edition printed postcards (sent to top customers) can also create a memorable “wow” moment during Christmas marketing campaigns. Either way, the aim is to strengthen loyalty by making customers feel appreciated during the season. Chewy, the pet supplies retailer, is renowned for sending actual handwritten holiday cards to its customers. They employ a whole team of card-writers to pen personal notes thanking customers (often including something personal like the pet’s name). Source: X.com Use CleverTap’s automation to trigger thank-you notes at scale: for instance, after a November purchase, you could send a “Thank You for Your Support – Enjoy 10% Off Next Order!” holiday email. Another Christmas marketing idea is to leverage the holiday goodwill by launching a seasonal referral bonus. Reward customers who refer friends and family with holiday-themed incentives. For example, “Give $10, Get $10” gift cards or double reward points if a new customer buys a gift. Make it a win-win: the referrer gets a reward, and the friend also enjoys a welcome discount. Promote the referral offer in your emails, app, and on receipts (“Refer a friend this holiday and you’ll both get $10 off!”). During Christmas, people love recommending gifts. You’re just amplifying word-of-mouth in a measurable way. Run a Christmas-themed giveaway to boost engagement and follower counts. For example, host a social media contest: “Win a $100 Gift Box from us” by liking, sharing, or tagging friends. Alternatively, a photo contest like “Most Festive Decorated Tree” or “Coziest Winter Workspace” featuring your products. Contests create buzz, user-generated content, and excitement around your brand. Make sure the prize is something attractive (perhaps one of your bundles or gift cards). Collect entries and emails (with permission) so you can notify winners. Featuring user photos as part of the contest also builds social proof. Team up with influencers or bloggers for holiday gift roundups. Identify micro-influencers in your niche (e.g., parenting, tech, beauty) and send them a curated holiday gift set. Have them unbox or review the products on social media or YouTube, ideally in a Christmas-themed video (e.g., “Top 5 Holiday Gifts I’m Giving” featuring your products). Alo Yoga did a special holiday collaboration: they released a limited Advent Calendar box of goodies and sent it to wellness influencers, who then unboxed one item each day on TikTok and Instagram. Those influencer videos not only reviewed the products but also built excitement day by day. Source: Alo Yoga Influencers’ authentic recommendations can reach highly targeted audiences. Provide them with a unique discount code to share, creating urgency for their followers. Partner with another brand or artist for a co-branded holiday product or bundle. For example, a fashion retailer might team up with a local accessory designer to create a limited-edition holiday ornament or scarf. Such collaborations generate press and social media interest. Promote the special product jointly in both partners’ marketing channels and offer it as a gift idea. Even a small co-branding (e.g., a custom gift card design with a local artist) can add novelty. CleverTap can assist by creating segments of customers who like either brand and sending them announcements about the new launch, maximizing reach across both customer bases. “Give back” campaigns resonate deeply at Christmas. For instance, run a “buy one, donate one” promotion (e.g., for every product sold, you donate the same item to charity) or pledge a percentage of holiday revenue to a cause. Customers feel good about purchasing when they know it helps someone else. Promote this heavily: add a banner like “This Holiday, Every Purchase Helps [Cause]” on your site. A great campaign idea is to let customers choose between several charities at checkout and match their choice. Not only does this increase goodwill, but it also encourages buyers who prioritize ethical brands. The more visible the campaign (social posts, emails, site banners), the more it amplifies both the impact and your brand’s feel-good story. For example, Lego’s annual #BuildToGive campaign asks fans to build a Lego ornament and share it; for each one posted, Lego donates a set to a child in need. Source: Lego Incorporate local or community elements into your holiday marketing. For example, you could highlight artwork from local artists on your holiday cards or use photos of your local team prepping for Christmas (if appropriate). Feature stories about how your business is celebrating with the community. By foregrounding a local angle (e.g., “Made in [Your City] with love” or “Local artisans in our holiday market”), you tap into that trend. Host a local pop-up event or collaborate with a neighborhood charity, and share it on social. These efforts humanize your brand and can foster loyalty from customers who value community impact. Use clever follow-ups to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers. For everyone who purchased during the Christmas season, send a thank-you email or in-app note in early January. Include a New Year coupon or free shipping code to entice another purchase. Showing appreciation after the fact builds loyalty. A simple “Thank you for your support – enjoy 15% off your next order” goes a long way. Schedule these as automated flows in CleverTap so that every holiday buyer enters a post-purchase sequence. You can also use behavioral triggers, such as offering early access to your January sales to customers who have made multiple holiday purchases. This recency-based outreach keeps your brand top-of-mind and can turn satisfied holiday shoppers into regulars. CleverTap provides the personalization and automation backbone to scale these ideas. Its platform unifies customer data and engagement across push, in-app, email, SMS, and more. For example, CleverTap can create user segments (by location, purchase history, or holiday affinity) and automate tailored campaigns: sending a “12 Days of Deals” push series to one group, while emailing “Gifts for Her” guides to another. Features like behavioral triggers and real-time analytics enable you to instantly remarket to a wishlist user, trigger a cart abandonment email, or send a holiday thank-you flow with minimal manual effort. Many brands use CleverTap to send millions of holiday notifications at peak times, ensuring personalized offers reach the right customers. CleverTap helps you plan, personalize, and perfect your Christmas campaigns. It handles large holiday traffic with built-in scalability, and its reporting lets you see which strategies are driving sales and where to tweak.

Title: Fears of an AI workforce takeover may be overblown — but it's still scrambling firms' hiring plans

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing chorus of executives has put white collar workforces on notice: Their jobs are at risk of being wiped out by artificial intelligence. Yet above that din is a more complicated picture of how AI is currently affecting hiring. Direct evidence of an acceleration in human obsolescence remains scant so far. In a report this week, the job and hiring consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said cuts spurred by President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency remained the leading cause of job losses — especially for government, nonprofit and other sectors supported by federal funds — followed by general economic and market conditions. Out of 286,679 planned layoffs so far this year, only 20,000 were linked to automation, the firm said — with just 75 explicitly tied to AI implementation. “Far less is happening than people imagine,” said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the consultancy, referring to the impact of AI on the broader workforce in the U.S. “There are roles that can be significantly changed by AI right now, but I’m not talking to too many HR leaders who say AI is replacing jobs.” That belies recent comments made by some of America’s most prominent executives about the impact that artificial intelligence is expected to have. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned that AI would “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. However, he did not lay out what that time frame might look like. He also said more people would likely be needed to do “other types of jobs,” ones that AI may help generate. And while The Wall Street Journal reported comments from Ford CEO Jim Farley this week that AI would replace “literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.,” a clip of Farley’s presentation offered more context. The automotive executive was speaking about beefing up America’s blue-collar workforce, and appeared to be repeating the warning about a white-collar wipeout issued by the CEO of the AI company Anthropic — a contention that is still being debated. (A representative for Ford did not respond to a request for comment.) Experts say the current era of AI is impacting the job market in more roundabout ways. Many firms are currently under tremendous pressure to cut costs given the generally uncertain economic environment spurred by the heavy cost of Trump’s tariff policy and worries about rising inflation. As a result, some companies are diverting spending that would otherwise be going to hiring more employees and shifting it toward AI software. “There’s basically a blank check to go out and buy these AI tools,” said Josh Bersin, CEO of The Josh Bersin Company workforce consultancy. “Then they go out and say, as far as head count: No more hiring. Just, ‘stop.’ So that immediately freezes the job market.” Among the most high-profile examples is Shopify, whose CEO told employees they must now prove why they “cannot get what they want done using AI” before asking for more employees and resources. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote in a memo sent to employees in March. “This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” The chief executive of language learning app Duolingo, Luis von Ahn, issued a similar edict in May, writing that the firm would gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle and that a budget for new employees would only be given “if a team cannot automate more of their work.” Enough firms hedging in this way, alongside a wider economic slowdown, may indeed be suppressing overall hiring, especially in business and professional services. But those trends do not amount to large-scale replacement of existing workers by AI agents. Then there are the firms creating the AI tools themselves — the ones other businesses are ostensibly looking to purchase and deploy to automate their workforces. These AI developers, including Dell, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce, have been shedding workers not tied to AI product development and shifting resources toward those who are. If AI is causing job losses, it’s not because it’s doing someone else’s job. It’s because budgets — and demands on the bottom line — are changing. The state of hiring at Microsoft is illustrative. Over the past several weeks, the tech giant — whose stock has surged 17% year to date thanks in part to the popularity of its Copilot AI tool — has announced job cuts affecting some 15,000 roles, or about 7% of its workforce. In this case, some human replacement does appear to be occurring: CEO Satya Nadella said recently that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI — something Bloomberg News confirmed in a report showing software engineering roles made up more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut in one of the recent layoff rounds. Yet other analysts indicated the cuts were also likely designed to offset the costs associated with Microsoft’s massive buildout of data centers designed to handle AI computer processing. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000” in order to make up for its increased capital expenditures, said Gil Luria, a tech research analyst at D.A. Davidson financial group, in an interview with Reuters. In a note to clients, analysts with the consultancy Capital Economics said not all mentions of AI by businesses discussing their financial picture should be taken at face value. “For some firms, AI is a way to spin job losses driven by poor financial performance in a more positive light,” they wrote. AI is also impacting the hiring and recruiting process itself. A galaxy of startups now offers tools that can perform the job of entire HR departments, from scanning resumes to interviewing candidates. At IBM, “a couple hundred” HR workers have been recently replaced by AI agents, CEO Arvind Krishna told The Wall Street Journal in May. Yet with those efficiencies, the company was able to hire more programmers and salespeople, he said. “While we have done a huge amount of work inside IBM on leveraging AI and automation on certain enterprise workflows, our total employment has actually gone up, because what it does is it gives you more investment to put into other areas,” Krishna said. For anyone struggling to find new work, AI is not without blame. But experts say economic factors continue to vastly outweigh the threat from automation. “Our research has shown that AI will fundamentally change a whole lot of jobs, some by a lot,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. In the case of software developers especially, she said, roles are being completely transformed. “But does it still mean AI took that job? I don’t think so,” she said. “There’s not evidence that it’s fully replacing whole workers, or that the current slowdown can be attributed to it.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nvidia on track to become world's most valuable company
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0704/1521822-nvidia-on-track-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company/

Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion yesterday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4% to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5% at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7% to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centres and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the UK. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7% of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28% of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Nvidia touched a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly overtaking Apple's record valuation. Its stock climbed as high as $160.98 in early trade before settling at $159.60, placing its valuation at $3.89 trillion—just short of Apple’s all-time high of $3.915 trillion from December 2024.(Source: Reuters) Investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence continues to surge, with Nvidia at the center of this wave. Its high-end chips are now essential for training advanced AI models, making the company a prime beneficiary of the current AI investment cycle. Tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla are racing to build out AI data centers. This has created unprecedented demand for Nvidia’s processors. Microsoft’s market cap stands at $3.7 trillion, while Apple, now in third place, is valued at $3.19 trillion. Nvidia’s transformation has been dramatic. From a valuation of $500 billion in 2021, the company’s worth has soared nearly eight-fold, nearing the $4 trillion mark. It’s now more valuable than the entire Canadian and Mexican stock markets combined and surpasses the market cap of all UK-listed companies. Despite the explosive stock gains, Nvidia trades at about 32 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. That’s actually below its five-year average of 41, signaling that earnings estimates are rising even faster than its share price. Nvidia’s shares have rebounded over 68% since their April low, which followed market fears around President Trump’s global tariff plans. Optimism around potential trade deals has helped ease concerns, reigniting investor confidence. As Nvidia becomes increasingly dominant, its influence is spreading across the broader market. The company now makes up 7% of the S&P 500. Together with Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, these tech giants comprise 28% of the entire index, impacting millions of retirement portfolios. Despite the enthusiasm, some experts urge caution. Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners warns that while AI is a powerful productivity tool, the current models—especially large language and reasoning models—may fall short of expectations. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Nvidia started as a niche GPU company for video games. Today, it has become Wall Street’s go-to indicator for the AI sector, even replacing Intel in the Dow Jones index in a landmark shift for the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia’s future looks bright, challenges remain. In January, a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, shook markets with a cheaper model that outperformed Western rivals. If such trends continue, spending on high-end processors could come under pressure. However, Nvidia’s momentum and strategic positioning still keep it ahead of the curve.

Photo: Adrian Murrell/Getty Images Limerick rugby has always been different. For generations rugby was a middle-class, if not upper-class, pursuit, in Ireland. The vast majority of the rugby playing population began their careers in the most prestigious fee-paying schools in Ireland, like Clongowes and Blackrock College. This point was reflected in Brendan Behan’s observation: “I never heard rugby was a proper game for anyone except bank clerks. It was a game for the Protestant and the shop-keeping Catholic and I never thought it had anything to do with me.”

Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2 per cent at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fuelling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $498.5. Apple rose 0.8 per cent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. Suzuki Is becoming a top japan importer with Made-in-India cars A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms , Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 per cent from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. U.S. stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4 per cent on the benchmark S&P 500 . India needs to reverse-engineer imports and invest in deep-tech to reduce dependence on China: GTRI Nvidia's swelling market capitalization underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Title: Cloudflare’s AI game-changer, Intel’s challenges and the Trump-Musk catfight

UPDATED 23:06 EDT / JULY 03 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Artificial intelligence model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic that have had a mostly free ride on scraping the entire internet to train their models may be facing a serious roadblock now. Internet infrastructure services firm Cloudflare this week enabled website operators to charge AI developers for access to their material. It’s a bit of a closing-the-barn-door-after-the-horses-fled situation — not Cloudflare’s fault — but since AI models need constant training and retraining, maybe this will change the balance of power. Meanwhile, competition is intensifying in AI — isn’t it always? Apple, for one, is playing off Anthropic against OpenAI to run its voice assistant Siri. Elon Musk’s xAI raised $10 billion to upgrade its infrastructure to stay in the game. And Baidu has open-sourced its Ernie AI model in a bid to take on OpenAI. Can Intel survive? Dave Vellante and David Floyer think new CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s plan has a chance, but a lot still has to go right — including some downsized ambitions, the latest of which is that it’s looking at moving on from one of its fab processes. No sooner did Musk rake President Trump’s awful-for-every-reason budget bill and call the GOP the Porky Pig Party (for once he’s not wrong) than Trump said he’d maybe review Musk’s immigration status. Then Tesla’s stock tanked. The next day, Tesla deliveries plunged but not as much as investors feared, and shares rose 5%. More popcorn, please! Cybersecurity firm Cato Networks raised a massive $359 million late-stage funding round, as consolidation in the industry continued. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finally closed its acquisition of Juniper Networks after getting the green light from the Justice Department. Zeus Kerravala looked at the implications for both sets of customers, but as always, it will depend on how well the acquirer manages the combination. You can hear more about this and other news on the latest podcast theCUBE Pod from John Furrier and Dave Vellante: On theCUBE Pod: The robotics debate, stablecoins and the AI race continues Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond — a slightly early Independence Day week edition — but check back later this week, since I’ll be adding new stories as they break: AI game changer?

Title: Report: Microsoft's 2025 layoffs revolve around its desperate $80 billion AI infrastructure investment
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/report-microsofts-2025-layoffs-revolve-around-its-desperate-usd80-billion-ai-infrastructure-investment
Time Published: 2025-07-03T22:35:51Z

The Redmond giant has laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, and a report claims it's all in the name of freeing up spending money to invest more heavily in AI infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-growing AI bubble. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft initiated yet another round of layoffs this week, impacting multiple organizations including gaming, sales, and marketing. Over 9,000 employees were cut, on top of the 6,000 that took place back in May. That means the Redmond giant has laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025 alone, and it's all to fund more AI infrastructure. According to a report from The Seattle Times, Microsoft is moving to reduce headcount to free up more capital for AI spending. Specifically, the company is looking to invest more money in AI infrastructure and technologies, and is making various cuts across many organizations and divisions to fund these efforts. "Microsoft’s push into AI doesn’t mean the company is replacing workers with the technology. Rather, the significant cost of building out the infrastructure over multiple years has Microsoft looking to trim costs where it can," The Seattle Times reports. That said, a chunk of the roles Microsoft has laid off in recent months were roles that could be aided by AI technology. The company has invested heavily in AI technology that can debug and write code and is reportedly planning to make AI use mandatory with checks to ensure this conducted in performance reviews. Microsoft has announced that it intends to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure in the coming year to keep pace with the rest of the AI bubble. This is up $25 billion over the previous fiscal year. In recent weeks, reports have suggested that Microsoft and OpenAI's multibillion dollar partnership has become strained as both companies seek different things. It should be clear to anyone following Microsoft closely that the company has become AI crazed in the last two years. Since 2023, Microsoft has rushed to implement AI technology in as many products and services as it can, regardless of whether that technology is ready for mainstream use. The recent layoffs amassing over 15,000 people come as Microsoft signs off one of its best years ever financially. The company has soared ahead of Apple in market cap, and is trailing NVIDIA as most valuable company in the world. Investing heavily in AI infrastructure and products at the cost of everything else is proving popular amongst shareholders. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told employees that despite layoffs, the Xbox "platform, hardware, and game roadmap [has] never looked stronger." Microsoft scrapped two in-development game projects as part of its most recent wave of layoffs, all to make room for more AI infrastructure it seems. Ultimately, the recent layoffs have left a foul taste in a lot of people's mouths. And it's not just Microsoft, though it appears to have laid off a considerable amount in 2025 alone. Layoffs have hit everyone from Meta to Amazon, impacting over 50,000 jobs in tech across hundreds of companies, many of which are reporting record profits. Unfortunately, this wave of layoffs doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already hinted that the company expects to reduce headcount in the next few years as AI becomes more adopted internally. It's unlikely Amazon will be alone in this thinking.

Title: Best golf courses in Co Louth: Bucket list courses and hidden gems from Baltray to Ardee
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/golf/2025/07/03/best-golf-courses-in-co-louth-bucket-list-courses-and-hidden-gems-from-baltray-to-ardee/

The drive from Drogheda along the River Boyne to the village of Baltray is one which heightens expectations of what awaits at the mouth of the river. County Louth Golf Club – a fine, traditional links – has earned its place among the top courses in the country. Originally designed in the 1890s by a Scottish professional with the wonderful name of Mr Snowball, the man most responsible for leaving his imprint on this seaside course – where Shane Lowry won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 – was the noted golf course architect Tom Simpson and his assistant Molly Gourlay. [ Fairways to Heaven - Ireland's Ultimate Golf GuideOpens in new window ] The links itself is a true test from start-to-finish, as it weaves its way in different directions but still consists of two loops. The most dramatic run of holes comes on the back nine, with the run from the 10th to 13th comprising arguably the best sequence of four successive par-fours anywhere. The 14th is the shortest of the par-fours but one of the best, playing from the elevated tee with the final destination of a green planted into the sand hills. In every sense, Baltray – the traditional home of the men’s East of Ireland championship – is a links that will reward and captivate, while being at all times challenging. Its clever design, utilising the terrain that is primarily flat before delving into the sand hills from the 12th to the 14th, entices and demands attention on every shot. As part of the bucket list, it is worth factoring in a round at the adjacent Seapoint links – designed by Des Smyth and Declan Branigan – which has matured wonderfully, especially the back nine which takes in views of the Irish Sea from a number of vantage points. The best is probably left to last at Seapoint. The 18th hole running along the coastline back to the clubhouse where the spirit of the 19th hole welcome is very much in play. Co Louth Golf Club, Baltray, Drogheda, Co Louth, A92 HK03; 041-9881530 Seapoint Golf Club, Termonfeckin, Co Louth; 041-9822333; email: ed@seapoint.ie Greenore is a long established course dating back to the 1890s but remains one of those hidden gems, primarily because its location on the Cooley peninsula overlooking Carlingford Lough ... but it is very much worth discovering as a fine test of golf in a wonderful setting with views across to the Mournes. Wind, given its location, is invariably a factor but the layout is open with the challenge set before the player off the tee with no hidden surprises. Although flat, the loughside course has its challenges with tidal water in play, most notably on the sixth and seventh holes. The tee to the Par 3 sixth is located on a disused railway line and plays downhill to the green, while it is followed by a demanding Par 4 with a tee shot over water. Greenore Golf Club, Greenore, Dundalk; 042-9373212 Dundalk Golf Club is a classic parkland course with a reputation for its wonderful greens. Located above the picturesque village of Blackrock, the treelined course has three distinct segments with an opening stretch of four tough Par 4s, then a stretch to the 12th that includes four Par 5s and a tough finishing run all the way to the 18th which is known as “Harrington’s Challenge,” in honour of three-time Major champion Pádraig Harrington who won the Dundalk Scratch Cup in 1995. Dundalk Golf Club, Blackrock, Dundalk, County Louth; 042-9321731; email: manager@dundalkgolfclub.ie Ardee Golf Club has matured into a lovely tree-lined course and, with the Tain Trail part of the local history, has connections with Cuchulainn in the names of the 1st (Cuchulainn’s Crown) and the seventh (Ferdia). The stretch of holes from the 11th to the 14th is very demanding, with the short 13th that has water in play from tee to green showcasing the picturesque nature of the entire layout.

Title: Nvidia Briefly Became Most Valuable Company Ever

Δ The artificial intelligence chip designer’s market capitalization rose as high as $3.92 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s record closing value of $3.915 trillion on Dec. 26, 2024, Reuters reported Thursday. Nvidia’s market cap dipped to $3.89 trillion later Thursday, according to the report. The company still has the largest market value at this time, with Microsoft ranked second at $3.7 trillion and Apple third at $3.19 trillion, the report said. The report attributed Nvidia’s surge to Wall Street’s continued optimism about AI; tech giants’ demand for the company’s products, which they need to build their AI data centers; and Nvidia’s relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation. Nvidia’s market cap has increased nearly eightfold over the past four years, according to the report. The firm’s stock has rebounded from its recently closing low on April 4, which was attributed to the announcements of new tariffs in the United States that were made at that time, per the report. When Nvidia’s market cap hit what was then its all-time high on June 25, Bloomberg reported that the company faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China but also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building AI infrastructure. During a May 28 earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said new U.S. export controls have effectively “closed” the $50 billion Chinese market to American companies. Despite that setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet demand for AI workloads. The company is doing so because demand for AI inference — the AI workloads in which new data is applied to trained models to generate outputs — is soaring. Other areas of growth include enterprise and industrial AI, and Nvidia has solutions for both, Huang said during the call. When Apple’s market capitalization surged in late December, analysts attributed the rise to the company’s involvement with AI and an expectation that the technology would lead to a wave of consumers deciding to upgrade their phones at once.

Title: What Wall Street’s rampaging run means for KiwiSaver investors - Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Wall Street's bull run has been a boon for KiwiSaver funds. Photo / File This week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, boosted by gains in technology stocks and a trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is only a fraction short of its record close on December 4. Meanwhile, a better-than-expected US jobs report for June reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve would not cut official interest rates this year. US stocks have more than made up for the tariff-driven selloff, so what will that mean for KiwiSaver investors, many of whom will have some kind of exposure to Wall Street? As at the end of March, investment research firm Morningstar tracked about $121 billion of assets in KiwiSaver, of which $49b was invested in international stock markets. “The MSCI World Index is about 72% US-based, so we would estimate that there would be around $35b invested in the US equity markets,” the firm told Stock Takes. That’s welcome news for KiwiSaver investors, given the New Zealand sharemarket has underperformed, reflecting the weak economy. Mark Lister, investment director at Craigs Investment Partners, said diversification had been a big plus. “The fact that KiwiSaver investors have a healthy allocation of US shares has been a very good thing in recent years because many investors - if they were making their own investment decisions - might have tilted towards the local market, which has been an underperformer. “The fact that KiwiSaver funds have been very internationally focused [and with the US being the world’s biggest share market] has ensured that KiwiSaver members and investors have had some very good returns in recent years.” Lister noted that, while the US market was at record highs, it had suffered a big fall in April on the back of US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. The US market had recouped its losses, but the weaker US dollar offset some of those gains for Kiwis. Lister said international diversification in general had been a positive for KiwiSaver investors, not just because of Wall Street’s performance. He noted emerging markets had also been strong, along with Japan, Europe and the UK. “Europe, to me, is probably one of the standouts because the euro has also been strong. “For a New Zealand investor, you’ve got the double whammy of a strongly performing European market and a rising euro against the Kiwi dollar. “All in all, it hasn’t been too bad in the first six months of the year for investors, and it’s been that international exposure that will have helped them, despite the local share market and the housing market continuing to lag.” While US stock markets look to be in full recovery mode, somebody has forgotten the US dollar, which is having its worst start to the year since 1973. Trump’s trade and economic policies have prompted global investors to rethink their exposure to the US, but the greenback’s role as the world’s reserve currency looks to be safe. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, paints an optimistic outlook for US equities, despite the uncertainties posed by Trump’s policies. “As US policy reclaims centre stage, we think immutable economic laws will limit extremes, while tax cuts and deregulation could boost investor sentiment,” BlackRock said in a commentary. US policy developments were coming thick and fast. “As the end of the 90-day tariff pause looms, we think immutable economic laws will prevent a return to a maximal stance. “We are also seeing movement in US policies that could boost investor sentiment, including tax cuts and regulatory reforms like a federal stablecoin framework. “These reforms will take time, but support our US equities overweight [position]. “We stay underweight long-term Treasuries on sticky inflation and deficit concerns.” Trump’s pause on sweeping tariffs expires on Wednesday. In New Zealand’s case, exporters face a 10% tariff on exports to the US. But analysts say the risk lies not so much with tariffs on New Zealand goods but the impact that they will have on world growth. Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr noted the US dollar’s weakness and the questions being asked about its reserve status. “My opinion is that we have not seen a dumping of the US dollar at all. “We have seen a diversification, perhaps, but certainly not a dumping. “Yields on US Treasuries are not rising in a concerning way - in fact, they have fallen (4.24% for US 10-years).” The weak US dollar is good news for Trump, who has long called for a lower greenback to make US manufacturers more competitive. “Trump is pretty sensitive to the financial markets, but having the dollar drop in the way that it has will not concern him at all,” Kerr said. While the New Zealand share market remained sidelined, the one bright spot seemed to be the agricultural sector. “My worry is that, if these tariffs come in, they will start to slow the world economy down, which is what many forecast. “That’s a worry because we are exposed to that slowdown. “And the best-performing sectors of the economy are the most exposed to the global slowdown.” A Malaysian company may be interested in buying Fletcher Building’s construction unit, according to a report in The Australian. The newspaper’s “Dataroom” said Malaysia’s Gamuda had expressed an interest in buying the Fletcher Building construction arm. Gamuda is an engineering, property and infrastructure group and is one of the largest in Malaysia’s infrastructure sector. Early last month, Fletcher Building told the NZX that it had received inquiries from parties interested in its businesses, including its construction division, after the company’s announcement of a strategic review. “The company advises that no decisions have been made to sell any of its businesses,” it said then. Tucked away in NZX-listed Burger Fuel’s annual report was a comment on the number of young people leaving for Australia. The chain said there had been a “significant” exodus of “home-grown, hardcore” Burger Fuel customers to Australia and other overseas destinations. “These younger Burger Fuel customers are not being replaced by incoming migrants, who are unlikely to purchase from Burger Fuel for some years,” the company said. Trading in 2025 had been “one of the toughest on record” for the hospitality industry, the report said. “Although there is talk of economic improvement, we have not seen this translate to sales; the economy remains in recession. “The slow reduction of interest rates and general economic uncertainty has led to consumers keeping their wallets in their pockets. “People are spending less and most certainly eating out less.” “We do not anticipate significant positive changes in the economic environment over the next 12 months,” chairman Alan Gourdie and chief executive Josef Roberts said.

Tokenization platform Ondo Finance ONDO$0.7758 and digital asset investment firm Pantera Capital have teamed up to invest $250 million in real-world asset (RWA) projects as the red-hot tokenization trend is accelerating. The initiative, named Ondo Catalyst, aims to invest in protocols and infrastructure projects that enhance the development of tokenized finance and on-chain capital markets, according to a Thursday blog post by Ondo. The initiative will do a mix of equity and token investments, a representative of Ondo told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. "The financial system is undergoing a fundamental upgrade," Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, said in the blog post. "By supporting the infrastructure and applications that unlock real-world utility for tokenized assets, we're helping reshape how capital moves around the world." Tokenization is one of the fastest-growing crypto use cases and has captivated big banks, fintechs, asset managers and crypto native firms alike. The process aims to bring traditional financial instruments such as bonds, stocks and real estate, often dubbed RWAs, onto blockchain rails, promising more efficient operations, faster and around-the-clock settlements, broader investor access and programmable transactions. For example, Robinhood, Bybit, Kraken and Gemini have recently introduced trading with tokenized versions of U.S. stocks, while BlackRock and Franklin Templeton issue tokenized money market funds backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries. Ondo is one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury issuers, with its OUSG and USDY tokens having a combined market capitalization of nearly $1.4 billion, data by RWA.xyz shows. The firm is also developing a layer-1 blockchain network designed for tokenized RWAs. The news of the partnership was first reported by Axios.

Microsoft has confirmed it will lay off nearly 4 percent of its workforce as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged US$80 billion (A$122 billion) in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft has now planned to reduce organisational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on July 2. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10 percent of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Microsoft confirmed to Reuters that its gaming division was impacted by the layoffs, although not the majority of the unit, but did not provide further details. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5 percent of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across large corporations spanning multiple sectors in recent months as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against financial pressures.

Title: Considering A Career Move Or Pension In Crypto? Crypto’s Overdue Respect
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/07/03/considering-a-career-move-or-pension-in-crypto-cryptos-overdue-respect/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Young stock trader shows executive managers cryptocurrency and market correlation on wall TV. It is estimated that over 55 million Americans use cryptocurrencies, 20% of the adult population. Europe has an estimated 31 million cryptocurrency users, 25% of the adult population, and in the U.K. its 12% of the of the adult population, or 4 million adults. Africa has 38 million users, Latin America has 55 million users, and Asia, comprising 48 counties, has 263 million users. Crypto is moving into the mainstream globally and the broad acceptance of digital assets is accelerating. The U.S. Administration’s pro-crypto stance is certainly delivering greater regulatory clarity with the Genius Act for stablecoins and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. SEC Chair Paul Atkins says the self-custody of crypto is a fundamental American right, linking it to personal freedom and property control. Under Chair Atkins, with the support of Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, the SEC has dropped most of the crypto lawsuits filed during former chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. Greater regulatory clarity is welcome, and it is increasingly clear that there is a growing change of attitude towards cryptocurrencies among many global regulators driven by a range factors including the prospect of greater economic growth, financial inclusion and wealth creation opportunities for citizens. The markets have witnessed Circle’s eye watering IPO and share price which is helping to drive the path to IPO for crypto exchanges like Kraken, Gemini and Bullish. It is difficult to not conclude that cryptocurrencies and digital assets are becoming respectable. By many estimates, almost half of the professionals working in crypto and digital assets come from TradFi capital markets, top tier banks to asset managers. There has always been somewhat of career risk for TradFi talent working in crypto, especially enduring the hostility by some policymakers and regulators over the past few years. Institutional investment is now piling in crypto - it is estimated that institutions now hold 25% of the U.S. bitcoin ETF market - and this is making crypto more respectable and driving a requirement for TradFi talent that is willing to stake its career on working in the burgeoning digital assets industry. New research by leading European digital assets hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management shows that is changing. Nickel Digital itself was founded by an alumnus from Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan. The research surveyed institutional investors and wealth managers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates who collectively manage over $1 trillion in assets. More than half (53%) surveyed believe the career risk for executives in the crypto industry has fallen under the Trump Presidency with 17% saying it has significantly reduced. Around a third (33%) say the risk has increased with only 1% say it has significantly increased. Mitigating career risks depends largely on regulation of the sector. More than four out of five (83%) questioned said it is extremely or very important in reducing career risk when investing in digital assets with 30% saying it is extremely important. Anatoly Crachilov, ceo and founding partner at Nickel Digital, says, “The mainstream adoption of digital assets pioneered by firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman, has been turbo-charged by the Trump presidency and the fear of career risk is receding, driving greater engagement by traditional allocators. “Robust regulation is central to the growth of the sector but there are more practical issues to be addressed including deeper liquidity and improvements to market infrastructure that will mitigate counterparty risks concerns.” Defined benefit and hybrid pension scheme specialist Cartwright has announced the first bitcoin allocation into the investment portfolio of an unnamed U.K. pension scheme. It described the investment as “a strategic move that, not only offers diversification, but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” The Cartwright announcement was denounced as “deeply irresponsible” by some commentators, pointing to the cautionary tale of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan writing down its $95 million investment in FTX following its bankruptcy. This criticism is misplaced as the FTX bankruptcy was down to the founders committing fraud on a grand scale, and is nothing to do with cryptocurrencies or new blockchain digital technologies. U.S. pension schemes however are not worried. Schemes in Wisconsin and Michigan are major investors in crypto ETFs which are regulated. Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma are looking at establishing bitcoin reserves. Zodia Markets Ireland chair Michael Walsh estimates that 1% of crypto ETFs are being bought by U.S. pension funds which sounds small, and adds “1% of a $100 billion market might not seem significant but it represents over a billion dollars with substantial room for growth.” The growth potential in the crypto ETF market is obvious and the direction of travel seems to be up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently bought $970 million Bitcoin in a day and now holds over $56 billion in assets. It is estimated to hold 3% of the total global supply of bitcoin. Blackrock’s IBIT is the one of the hottest ETF tickets in the market, overtaking its S&P 500 ETF in annual revenue. BlackRock ceo Larry Fink has talked about bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency due to potential concerns about rising U.S. Government debt, especially following the fresh passage of the new budget bill. With record U.S. debt, weak bond auctions, and the weakest dollar since the 1970s, the threat of the U.S. debt default is looming on the mind of foreign debt holders, with some foreign asset managers publicly stating they are now overweight in both U.S. debt and equity. The Nickel Digital research among firms already invested in digital assets shows growth in crypto markets is driving increased respectability. Markets can drift but as long as they are not crashing there is a continuing confidence that builds over the the longer-term. Nearly nine out of 10 (88%) questioned say they will increase their level of investment in digital assets this year, building on the 67% who said they increased investment in the last year. They expect major investor groups to follow suit. Around 70% predict pension funds will dramatically increase investment in digital assets over the next two years while 57% believe wealth managers will dramatically increase investment and 40% say the same about family offices. Most are increasingly positive about the outlook for digital assets as they increase their understanding of the industry with 90% positive on digital assets as an asset class and 13% saying they are very positive. None of the organisations surveyed were negative on the current market with 10% saying they were neutral. Part of the growing confidence is due to deeper engagement with the digital asset industry and a greater understanding of the investment benefits beyond investment returns. Nickel Digital’s research asked professional investors to rank the benefits of investing in the industry. The ability to trade 24/7 and the efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem are rated as the two major benefits of investing in the sector ahead of the prospect of better returns than other asset classes, which was rated third. Capital appreciation and the role of digital assets as a hedge against currency depreciation were ranked fourth and fifth ahead of yield opportunities and their role as a hedge against inflation. Arbitrage opportunities and low correlation to other asset classes were ranked eighth and ninth. Crachilov stresses the importance of regulation saying, "Regulators play a critical role in supporting the evolution of the digital asset sector. While no regulatory framework can eliminate all possible risks, investors appreciate value of global regulators' drive for transparency, accountability, while, at the same time, providing constructive approach to regulation in the crypto sector." The research found 88% believe the risk of another FTX-style scandal has been reduced with more than a third (35%) saying it has fallen sharply. A similar study in July 2024 by Nickel Digital found 75% believed the risk had dropped with 20% saying it had fallen sharply. Confidence in regulation and growing respectability is encouraging more firms to engage. 43% of institutional investors and wealth managers questioned believe there will be a dramatic increase in traditional financial firms launching crypto funds and investment solutions over the next two years. That increasing involvement by traditional institutions is good news for the sector with nearly one in five (18%) say the involvement of major firms is very positive for the sector and 74% saying it’s quite positive. Performance is key – investors questioned believe crypto will be one of their top five asset classes for risk-adjusted returns over the next five years. Private equity was the next most selected followed by emerging market (EM) equities – EMs have become popular destinations for those asset allocators overweight in U.S. equities. Crypto’s journey to respectability has been a long one. There will be bumps in the road ahead, though the threat of the next crypto winter in the short term appears a lower probability to most crypto analysts and pundits. Many TrandFi analysts and pundits are not as sure they can say same the same about traditional markets.

Title: Microsoft's enshittification of Xbox, Surface, and even Windows itself, are by design — with greed and corner-cutting replacing innovation

With Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood placing unrealistic expectations on Xbox, Windows, and others — the damage is becoming increasingly untenable. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about how Xbox had turned a corner, following a decent Xbox Showcase and a firm commitment to hardware. Speculation had been swirling that Xbox will hand off its hardware aspirations to OEMs like ASUS, leaving first-party hardware teams and customers facing an uncertain future. Microsoft's gaming financials don't always look healthy on the face of it either, putting a dark cloud over the entire platform. How naive of me. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled that 9,000 were facing the axe, bringing the annual total to 15,300 or more. Many hundreds of those layoffs were at Xbox specifically, with cuts that seemingly fell indiscriminately across the entire portfolio. Staffers who had been at Xbox for a decade or more, personally responsible for millions of dollars in revenue, got the cut. Legendary leaders at major studios were culled, projects were shut down, and in one case, an entire studio was closed. There's a meme in the Xbox community about how "Xbox is dead" every five minutes, because of the non-stop roller coaster of changing strategies and inconsistent messaging Microsoft has foisted onto the customer base (and employees too) in recent years. Today, Microsoft announced that Helldivers 2 is coming to Xbox, and is the first-ever PlayStation published title on the platform. You couldn't really plan for more unfortunate timing. Xbox is dead, Xbox is alive, and so on. The thing is, this isn't unique to Xbox. It's applicable to every department at Microsoft all up. As of this year, I've been covering the Xbox, Windows, Surface, Windows Phone, and Microsoft beat for ten years. I came in as an amateur blogger, just an Xbox fan, with little knowledge of the tech business or business in general. I've learned a lot over the years, through all of the successes and mistakes, over-confidence and under confidence. Through it all, I'd always tried to hold on to fandom for Xbox for myself, the community, and the hobby in general — while remaining critical, and voicing the concerns of customers. We all rallied for bringing more Japanese games for Xbox, we called for boosted localization, and called for improvements to the Xbox PC experience. Microsoft delivered in varying degrees, but the staggering cadence of mixed messaging, changing strategies, and inconsistency is a disservice to both customers and employees alike. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. I'm joining many others in feeling that under CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood — being a "fan" for devs, potential employees, and customers alike — is becoming simply impossible. Microsoft as an entity feels directionless, changing strategies on a dime, and laying off thousands in its fickle wake. Sources who remain anonymous due to lack of authority to speak on internal matters have pointed the blame for yesterday's mammoth layoffs firmly at Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Hood's unrealistic fiscal expectations on Microsoft's subsequent divisions have created a culture of fear and doubt, ironically impacting productivity and thus profitability. There's sentiment among Microsoft staffers that many of the layoffs revolve around a broadening shift towards artificial intelligence, with executives and activist investor groups at the top growing increasingly concerned that Microsoft is losing, or may have even already lost, the AI race. It's well-documented that OpenAI and Microsoft's partnership is fractured, with OpenAI desperate to free itself from the restrictions its early investment deal with Microsoft have placed upon it. Microsoft enjoys exclusivity to various aspects of OpenAI's operation, including the first-right-of-refusal to hosting AI workloads, on top of revenue sharing requirements. OpenAI no longer grants Microsoft exclusive rights to hosting its services, however. And furthermore, all of these deals have an imminent expiry date: 2030. To that end, investors are nervous that all of Microsoft's AI "success" hinges solely on OpenAI, who is also bleeding talent to Meta at an alarming rate. At this nascent stage, it's not unrealistic to think a major breakthrough at a competing platform, particularly at a company like Meta whose social apps remain globally dominant, could completely unravel OpenAI at a moment's notice. Microsoft's position in AI would evaporate overnight, conceding the future of computing to other tech companies. Microsoft's home-grown AI products, many of which rely on OpenAI models anyway, are by and large complete trash in practice. Copilot is a stunted version of ChatGPT, the "Microsoft 365 Copilot" disaster is painfully limited in scope. Even bare-bones basics like generative erase in the Photos app pale in comparison to Samsung's, and Microsoft's internal efforts have nothing to show but tech demos and promises, with no real products. The only "real" product Microsoft has put out so far, Windows Recall, is almost universally hated as a privacy nightmare made manifest, despite changes Microsoft has attempted to make. The Copilot+ PC range that its tied to has been nothing short of a spectacular flop, while sacrificing the Surface brand in the process. It's a testament to Xbox's leadership that it was able to convince Microsoft to invest in Activision when it had the chance, because I'd be willing to bet that Satya Nadella and Amy Hood would have sacrificed all of Xbox to chase this latest AI splurge without it. There's sentiment that Microsoft executives and activist shareholders resent the idea that investment had fallen towards Call of Duty and Activision-Blizzard, instead of broadening their early AI investments. Microsoft is set to invest a similarly mammoth-esque $80 billion in new AI-enabled training centers around the world to try and turn its fortunes around, but what if it had had $160 billion from having not purchased Activision? These latest layoffs are funding this refreshed attempt to chase an external innovation, and represent the human cost of Microsoft's poor planning. Quick edit: since I wrote this, I saw that The Seattle Times has corroborated that these layoffs revolve around this $80 billion AI infrastructure investment, foisted on Xbox and other departments to account for the jitters around the potential failure of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI. Indeed, it's a testament to Xbox's leadership that it was able to convince Microsoft to invest in Activision when it had the chance, because I'd be willing to bet that Satya Nadella and Amy Hood would have sacrificed all of Xbox to chase AI without it. From Surface to Windows Phone, to Xbox and Windows itself, under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has utterly forgotten that real humans, customers, actually use its products. And seemingly, that real humans, actually build its products. When the Windows Recall privacy PR disaster happened last year, I sat to myself thinking "how in the fuck couldn't someone have seen this coming?" It was literally the first thing I thought of when I saw that Microsoft was putting out an app that would creepily watch everything on your screen. It screamed of product design by spreadsheet — the "people use AI, so AI good" brainchild of a mindless boardroom meeting that nobody in the room was really paying attention to. The entire Copilot+ PC range screams of this, utterly uninspired, underbaked and unthoughtful approach that has typified Surface since product architects Panos Panay and Ralf Groene were sadly driven out of the company, as Panay rebuilds his all-star team at Amazon instead. Surface used to be at the cutting edge of hardware innovation, producing head-turning products that even Apple itself couldn't ignore. And sure, the execution wasn't always on point. Under Panos Panay, Surface had become a reliable fixture of Microsoft's product calendar, and drove a wave of innovation and improved designs across Windows' entire OEM portfolio. In 2025, that's all but gone — a shell of its former self, with Microsoft using Surface as a vehicle to placate whatever latest tech fad Satya Nadella finds himself interested in at the time. There's nobody driving real innovation at Surface anymore, and it's sad. Windows Mixed Reality, the "metaverse" buzzword from 2023, Windows Phone, Microsoft Band, even Microsoft's painfully slow efforts with Windows on Arm compatibility — under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has this strange and uncanny ability to put out loud PR beats and then utterly under-invest and thus, under-deliver. We're seeing the same situation play out now with Copilot in slow motion, although that $80 billion investment is nothing to scoff at — it sounds like it's more about supporting other's services rather than Microsoft's own innovations. Microsoft Build events used to be a legendary confluence of developer passion and consumer product innovation, with exciting product reveals and service enhancements. Now, it's a dull parade of investor bait that typifies Nadella's approach to the company. Therein lies why I say Microsoft is now more of an investment bank than a product innovator. Like locusts, Microsoft's fiscal approach has been to swarm into a section with money and acquisitions. Then, under-invest and under-deliver, subsequently ruin the product, and then bail when the next over-hyped tech fad opportunity rolls around. This is before we talk about things like cutting corners around security, leading to the unprecedented Azure email hack, among other things. There's a litany of examples of this dating back across my entire career, and even further back before it. The brunt of this week's layoffs weren't in Xbox, but I don't see how Xbox can thrive in the corporate environment being constructed by Amy Hood and Satya Nadella, where investment mentality supersedes customer confidence, and employee wellbeing. But the cash keeps rolling in, so none of it matters, seemingly. I've been critical of Microsoft corporate for years, but Xbox enjoyed a bit of a bubble while Microsoft from the top largely ignored its operations. That was until Activision-Blizzard, of course. My naivete as an modern Xbox fan hit a turning point during Summer Game Fest this year. For most of my career, to my knowledge, Microsoft had these Xbox FanFest events at its shows like Gamescom and E3, where dozens, and even hundreds of fans were invited to participate in events. Microsoft wilfully and actively engaged in curating community fandom in this way, and it has done so in the past with Windows Phone, Surface, and other products. This year at Summer Game Fest, Microsoft had no Xbox FanFest of its own. But those who had been attending for years, and enjoyed the community and camaraderie, pooled and spent their own money to curate an Xbox FanFest event in LA. On the one hand, it was awesome to see the community rally, but on the other, it was utterly disappointing that Microsoft itself wouldn't spare the cash. Microsoft is approaching a 4 trillion-dollar market capitalization, with $22 billion in profits last quarter. They couldn't have spared a few thousand to put together an event for fans this year? Couldn't Satya Nadella have thrown a few dollars in from his $79 million stock awards package last year? One week ago at this time, myself, @benkenobi2020 , @DonteJMoody @Porshapwr Hargeet, @FonzGaming, @shaunlabrie @webdave @corkenstein @MrboomstickXL were getting the venue ready for Xbox Community Watch Party. Nerves were high as well as Stress. It was all worth it and a very… pic.twitter.com/9YwEFkXvjAJune 14, 2025 In among the mixed messaging over Xbox exclusives, the lack of clarity on Xbox's future — it was that that really didn't sit right with me. I'd tell myself it was all just a transition, with spending squeezed and playtime hours down ... The vast majority of gaming hours and spend sent into Fortnite and Roblox, and economic confidence hitting new lows. But then came this week's layoffs. These latest layoffs seem utterly indiscriminate — an overly aggressive and reductive move purely aimed to boost margins at the cost of everyone and everything else. Entire teams wiped out, families left to wonder what their future would look like. People who'd given huge chunks of their lives, blood sweat and tears, toward helping make Microsoft shareholders and execs rich. Friends who'd worked together for years, and worked with devs, fans, and press for years — some of whom were personally responsible for millions of dollars in revenue that helped shareholders get richer. I know it's not as if other companies haven't had layoffs, and I know that Xbox has things cooking. But I feel like it's in spite of Microsoft, rather than because of Microsoft. When you look at Microsoft's other products, like Windows 11, Surface, and even further back — the empty promises, the rug pulls, and broken promises, it screams to me of a company that simply isn't willing to take a risk, or give products the time they need to shine. Microsoft as an entity no longer has any real direction, and no conviction, and crucially, no willingness to actually compete. Microsoft represents the apex of late stage capitalism, where failure is rewarded, and the ability to shift capital rapidly voids the necessity to deliver for consumers and society in general. Microsoft increasingly just seems to go where other companies, true innovators, say the money is — looking for the next fad to devour and process, rather than curate and cultivate. How will Xbox, Surface, or Windows 11, grow without risk, investment, and curating consumer confidence? In a world where Microsoft has enough capital to just move wherever the wind is blowing, it simply doesn't seem to care. It doesn't have to be this way. The brutality of these layoffs is just another symptom of a sick money-first mentality. But how can you stop it? Microsoft employs hundreds of thousands of people, none of whom deserve to be in this position either, and most of whom aren't paid well enough for their hard work. Most of whom simply want to do great things and create great experiences and art, as Microsoft corporate works their hardest to stop them. Microsoft is a company that has no real mission or ethos anymore, and one that behaves more like a bank than a tech company, and it is certainly not one that deserves "fans." Maybe it never did. In any case, Microsoft is making more money than God right now. So, I guess it just doesn't matter. And ... maybe it never did. Edit: I had previously blamed Microsoft for its response to the Crowdstrike situation too in an upper segment here, but Microsoft granting kernel access to vendors was a result of European Union legislation, not as a result of outsourcing security. Apologies for that. But, there are plenty of other examples where Microsoft's security investments have been lacking, and have been blamed on corner cutting and putting profits first.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Your Echo device is more versatile than you think. These Alexa commands can save you time and make daily life more manageable. Make the most of your Echo devices with these Alexa commands. Since its arrival in 2014, Alexa has changed drastically from the voice assistant that was originally released. Instead of being an easier way to trigger music, or add to your to-do list, it's now an effective tool for managing all the different parts of your busy life. With the addition of new AI-powered features from Alexa Plus, your favorite voice assistant is more capable than ever. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a compelling tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now's a good time to see how much more useful it's become with AI-powered features now available. Though a recent CNET survey found that 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, Alexa was the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Nvidia (NVDA) could be poised to claim the title of most valuable company in history, as its market value nears $4 trillion. The AI chipmaker's shares rose just over 1% to close at an all-time high of $159.34 Thursday, pushing its market capitalization to $3.89 trillion. If the stock had sustained its intraday highs closer to $161, its market value would have topped Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion in December. With another roughly 3% rise from Thursday's closing price to $163.93, Nvidia could also hit the $4 trillion market cap threshold soon, something no other company has done. Microsoft (MSFT), which has jockeyed with Nvidia this year for the title of world's most valuable company, could too, according to Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives. “We believe both Nvidia and Microsoft will hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club....as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI Revolution," the analysts said in a note to clients Thursday. Thursday's rise came amid broader market gains, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting all-time highs ahead of a long holiday weekend. The stock market closed early at 1 p.m. ET Thursday ahead of the July 4 holiday on Friday.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Canadian dessert chain La Diperie is sending some Arctic chill down to the West Village. The Montreal-based La Diperie, known for its customizable dipped ice cream and treats, has signed a 10-year lease for 1,200 square feet at Midwood Investment and Development’s 56 Seventh Avenue, according to tenant broker RJBRE. Asking rent was $150 per square foot. The deal represents the dessert chain’s first location in New York City, following 65 stores across Canada and a spot in St. Petersburg, Fla., according to its website. La Diperie’s new store between West 13th and West 14th streets will be operated by Kishan and Ashlesha Patel and is slated to open early next year, according to the New York Business Journal, which first reported the news. “This marks La Diperie’s first New York location, and a key step in their U.S. expansion,” RJBRE’s Abraham Smouha, who brokered the deal for the tenant along with Richard Bailey, said in a statement to Commercial Observer. “We’re excited to bring their unique soft-serve experience to one of New York City’s most dynamic corridors,” Smouha added. Capricorn Retail Advisors’ Andrew Schulman, Ryan Schimel and Audrey Hersch represented the landlord in the deal. Schulman and spokespeople for La Diperie and Midwood did not immediately respond to requests for comment. La Diperie’s West Village spot will be at the base of the 159-unit Candela Tower, which Midwood bought from BlackRock Realty Advisors in May 2022 for $102 million, property records show.

Title: Accenture warns AI’s carbon emissions could surge 11-fold. But Big Tech’s still racing to build—and not slow down for sustainability

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI! In this edition...Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence…Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance…Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up…Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. As an early-summer heat wave blanketed my home state of New Jersey last week, it felt like perfect timing to stumble across a sobering new prediction from Accenture: AI data centers’ carbon emissions are on track to surge 11-fold by 2030. The report estimates that over the next five years, AI data centers could consume 612 terawatt-hours of electricity—roughly equivalent to Canada’s total annual power consumption—driving a 3.4% increase in global carbon emissions. And the strain doesn’t stop at the power grid. At a time when freshwater resources are already under severe pressure, AI data centers are also projected to consume more than 3 billion cubic meters of water per year—a volume that surpasses the annual freshwater withdrawals of entire countries like Norway or Sweden. Unsurprisingly, the report—Powering Sustainable AI—offers recommendations for how to rein in the problem and prevent those numbers from becoming reality. But with near-daily headlines about Big Tech’s massive AI data center buildouts across the U.S. and worldwide, I can’t help but feel cynical. The urgent framing of an AI race against China doesn’t seem to leave much room—or time—for serious thinking about sustainability. Just yesterday, for example, OpenAI agreed to rent a massive amount of computing power from Oracle data centers as part of its Stargate initiative, which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. The additional capacity from Oracle totals about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the U.S., according to Bloomberg reporting. A gigawatt is akin to the capacity from one nuclear reactor and can provide electricity to roughly 750,000 houses. And this week, Meta was reported to be seeking to raise $29 billion from private capital firms to build AI data centers in the U.S., while already building a $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana. As part of that deal, the local utility, Entergy, will supply three new power plants. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made his intentions clear: The U.S. must rapidly expand AI data center construction or risk falling behind China in the race for AI dominance. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast in May, he warned that America’s edge in artificial intelligence could erode unless it keeps pace with China’s aggressive build-out of data center capacity and factory-scale hardware. “The U.S. really needs to focus on streamlining the ability to build data centers and produce energy,” Zuckerberg said. “Otherwise, we’ll be at a significant disadvantage.” The U.S. government seems to be aligned with that sense of urgency. David Sacks, now serving as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, has also underscored that energy and data center expansion are central to America’s AI strategy—leaving little room for sustainability concerns. On his All In podcast in February, Sacks argued that Washington’s “go-slow” approach to AI could strangle the industry. He emphasized that the U.S. needs to clear the way for infrastructure and energy development—including AI data centers—to keep pace with China. In late May, he went further, saying that streamlining permitting and expanding power generation are essential for AI’s future—something he claimed has been “effectively impossible under the Biden administration.” His message: the U.S. needs to race to build faster. Accenture, meanwhile, is urging its clients to responsibly grow and engineer its AI data centers in a bid to balance growth with environmental responsibility. It is offering a new metric, that it calls the Sustainable AI Quotient (SAIQ), to measure the true costs of AI in terms of money invested, megawatt-hours of energy consumed, tons of CO₂ emitted and cubic meters of water used. The firm’s report says the metric will help organizations answer a basic question: “What are we actually getting from the resources we’re investing in AI?” and allow that enterprise to measure its performance across time. I spoke to Matthew Robinson, managing director of Accenture Research and co-author of the report, who emphasized that he hoped Accenture’s sobering predictions would be proven wrong. “They kind of take your breath away,” he said, explaining that Accenture modeled future energy consumption from the expected number of installed AI chips adjusted for utilization and the additional energy requirements of data centers. That data was combined with regional data on electricity generation, energy mix and emissions, while water use was assessed based on AI data center energy consumption and how much water is consumed per unit of electricity generated. “The point really is to open the conversation around the actions that are available to avert this pathway—we don’t want to be right here,” he said. He would not comment on the actions of specific companies like OpenAI or Meta, but said that overall, clearly more effort is needed to avert the rise in carbonisation fueled by AI data centers while still allowing for growth. Accenture’s recommendations certainly make sense: Optimize the power efficiency of AI workloads and data centers with everything from low-carbon energy options to cooling innovations. Use AI thoughtfully, by choosing smaller AI models, and better pricing models for incentivizing efficiency. And ensure better governance over AI sustainability initiatives. It’s hard to imagine that the biggest players in the race for AI dominance—Big Tech giants and heavily funded startups—will hit the brakes long enough to seriously address these growing concerns. Not that it’s impossible. Take Google, for example: In its latest sustainability report released this week, the company revealed that its data centers are consuming more power than ever. In 2024, Google used approximately 32.1 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, with a staggering 95.8%—about 30.8 million MWh—consumed by its data centers. That’s more than double the energy its data centers used in 2020, just before the consumer AI boom. Still, Google emphasized that it’s making meaningful strides toward cleaning up its energy supply, even as demand surges. The company said it cut its data center energy emissions by 12% in 2024, thanks to clean energy projects and efficiency upgrades. And it’s squeezing more out of every watt. Google reported that the amount of compute per unit of electricity has increased about six-fold over the past five years. Its power usage effectiveness (PUE)—a key measure of data center efficiency—is now approaching the theoretical minimum of 1.0, with a reported PUE of 1.09 in 2024. “Just speaking personally, I’d be optimistic,” said Robinson. Note: Check out this new Fortune video about my tour of IBM’s quantum computing test lab. I had a fabulous time hanging out at IBM’s Yorktown Heights campus (a midcentury modern marvel designed by the same guy as the St. Louis Arch and the classic TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport) in New York. The video was part of my coverage for this year’s Fortune 500 issue that included an article that dug deep into IBM’s recent rebound. As I said in my piece, “walking through the IBM research center is like stepping into two worlds at once. There are the steel and glass curves of Saarinen’s design, punctuated by massive walls made of stones collected from the surrounding fields, with original Eames chairs dotting discussion nooks. But this 20th-century modernism contrasts starkly with the sleek, massive, refrigerator-like quantum computer—among the most advanced in the world—that anchors the collaboration area and working lab, where it whooshes with the steady hum of its cooling system.” With that, here’s the rest of the AI news. Sharon Goldmansharon.goldman@fortune.com@sharongoldman Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence, after Daniel Gross steps down to join Meta. Ilya Sutskever, the former OpenAI chief scientist who founded Safe Superintelligence (SSI) with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy a year ago, confirmed that he will now serve as SSI’s CEO after Daniel Gross stepped down. Sustkever posted on X saying: “Daniel Gross’s time with us has been winding down, and as of June 29 he is officially no longer a part of SSI. We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next endeavor. I am now formally CEO of SSI, and Daniel Levy is President. The technical team continues to report to me. ⁠You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through.” Meta was rumored to have sought to acquire the $32 billion-valued SSI. Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese artificial intelligence companies are gaining ground globally, challenging U.S. supremacy and intensifying a potential AI arms race. Across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, organizations—from multinational banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered to Saudi Aramco—are increasingly adopting large language models from Chinese firms such as DeepSeek and Alibaba as alternatives to U.S. offerings like ChatGPT. Even American cloud giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google now offer access to DeepSeek’s models, despite U.S. government security restrictions on the company’s apps. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT still leads in global adoption—with 910 million downloads versus DeepSeek’s 125 million—Chinese models are undercutting U.S. competition by offering nearly comparable performance at much lower prices. Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up. As Mark Zuckerberg rapidly staffs up Meta’s new superintelligence lab, his company has reportedly offered some OpenAI researchers eye-popping pay packages of up to $300 million over four years, with more than $100 million in first-year compensation, Wired reports. The offers, which include immediate stock vesting, have been extended to at least 10 OpenAI employees, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. While Meta’s aggressive recruiting tactics have caught the attention of top talent, some OpenAI staffers told Wired they’re weighing the massive payouts against their potential impact at Meta versus staying at OpenAI. A Meta spokesperson pushed back, claiming reports of the offer sizes are exaggerated. Still, even Meta’s senior engineers typically make around $850,000 per year, with those in higher pay bands earning over $1.5 million annually, according to Levels.FYI data. Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. Microsoft’s sales chief, Judson Althoff, is reshaping the company’s sales organization to double down on AI, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. Althoff’s Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) unit will now focus on embedding Copilot across devices and roles, deepening Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 adoption, winning high-impact AI deals, expanding Azure cloud migration, and strengthening cybersecurity to support AI growth. The memo, sent just one day before Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs—many of which affected Althoff’s sales teams—outlined his vision to make Microsoft “the Frontier AI Firm.” According to Business Insider, this restructuring follows Althoff’s earlier plan to cut the number of sales solution areas in half starting this fiscal year.

That’s how much U.S. investment in AI companies soared to in the first quarter of this year—a 33% jump from the previous quarter and a staggering 550% increase compared to the quarter before ChatGPT’s 2022 debut, according to PitchBook. The biggest price tag? Data centers. The New York Times reports that Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google plan to spend a combined $320 billion on infrastructure this year—more than double what they spent just two years ago.

Title: Report: Microsoft tying to move towards AI agents amid mass layoffs
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Report-Microsoft-tying-to-move-towards-AI-agents-amid-mass-layoffs.1050517.0.html
Time Published: 2025-07-03T15:26:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft is going through another round of mass layoffs with 9,000 employees in various divisions being let go. While the management has called these layoffs organizational changes, a new report citing a developer with knowledge of the situation claims that Microsoft is looking to replace its human workforce with AI. Speaking at Meta’s inaugural LlamaCon AI developer event in May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had shared that about 30% of the company’s code is written by AI. Now, it looks like the company is going full steam ahead with AI integration and this could have something to do with the recent mass layoffs. A report by Engadget citing a developer at Microsoft who also received the memo from Phil Spencer, but supposedly was not let go, shared that management is “trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents." While the report does not elaborate on this claim, the memo stated “increase agility and effectiveness” as one of the reasons for the layoffs. If implemented correctly, AI agents can significantly optimize various workflows so the developer’s claim of Microsoft trying to replace human workers with AI agents surely has weight to it. This has become an industry trend as even Amazon had recently issued a memo to its employees stating that AI agents will replace some human jobs. Furthermore, the developer also shared his anger about the memo and the current situation of development at Microsoft. “I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about,” the developer reportedly told Engadget. They added that employees at Microsoft are not happy about the quality of the product and that a lot of pep talk is being used to try and up the morale. It should be noted that Microsoft has not associated AI agents with the mass layoffs but considering the AI-written code, using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and other AI related internal implementations, AI agents seem to be the end goal for the company.

Title: Nvidia set to become world's most valuable company
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0703/1521725-nvidia-set-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T15:24:02Z
Full Content:
Nvidia was on track to become the most valuable company in history today, with the chipmaker's market capitalisation reaching $3.92 trillion as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2% at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5% to $498.5. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US.stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4% on the benchmark S&P 500. AI poster child Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global
URL: http://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/wall-street-moves-on-chain-as-tokenization-of-us-stocks-goes-global/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T15:16:14Z

Highlights Major financial players like J.P. Morgan, Kraken and Robinhood are tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) — from carbon credits to U.S. equities. Tokenized assets, often offered through offshore entities, allow for fractional ownership, instant settlement and around-the-clock trading. Despite momentum, regulators in the U.S. and Europe have yet to clarify how tokenized securities fit into existing legal frameworks, raising concerns over investor protection, jurisdiction and systemic risk. One of the overarching themes of 2025, outside of its notable levels of uncertainty, is the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto markets.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ That theme got a shot in the arm this week, with the news Wednesday (July 2) that J.P. Morgan is reportedly developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, while on Monday (June 30), crypto exchange Kraken unveiled its long-anticipated platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities. That same day, Robinhood also announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Crucially, Kraken’s own offerings were similarly available only for eligible non-U.S. clients. While the initiatives may appear distinct, ranging from environmental credits to fractionalized equity exposure, the connective tissue is the same. Moving traditional financial services onto the blockchain. These moves represent a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), sidestep traditional clearing infrastructure, and begin transitioning toward 24/7, programmable trading markets. But these rapid developments also raise existential questions for market regulators and central intermediaries. Are tokenized securities complementary to, or competitive with, traditional capital markets? Can existing legal frameworks scale across these hybrid asset classes? And who bears responsibility when decentralized and centralized elements collide? Read more: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Tokenization, long the buzzword of blockchain evangelists, has entered its next phase. While initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dominated earlier narratives, the current wave of interest centers around tangible, regulated assets — stocks, bonds, commodities and now carbon credits. Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” Kraken and Robinhood’s own tokenized equities operate through offshore subsidiaries to remain compliant with current U.S. laws. These tokenized shares are backed 1:1 by real stocks custodied by licensed brokerages. The twist? Instead of trading through traditional clearinghouses on a T+2 settlement basis, these assets can now be exchanged 24/7 on blockchain rails, with near-instant settlement and global reach. For retail investors, especially outside the U.S., this offers fractional ownership of American blue-chip stocks without intermediaries or time zone constraints. For institutions, it hints at a future where securities can be programmed with smart contracts, auto-execute dividends and facilitate compliance in real time. PYMNTS explored this topic earlier in the month in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” See also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks’ Tokenization Projects Still, these launches come amid intensifying efforts by U.S. and European regulators to bring coherence to the digital asset ecosystem. And despite the momentum, the regulatory picture remains murky. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not offered formal guidance on tokenized versions of registered securities traded offshore. These assets are typically structured as derivatives or depositary receipts, akin to synthetic products like CFDs and are not true equities in the traditional sense. As with many innovations, there can be a fine line between democratizing access and weakening safeguards. “These ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer. Please be careful,” tweeted OpenAI’s press account on X (formerly Twitter). Still, regulatory momentum is gathering in the U.S. and PYMNTS covered how Republican senators at the end of last month (June 24) unveiled a set of principles to serve as a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets and crypto markets. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.” Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global European Commission Delays Release of AI Act’s Code of Practice Ford, JPMorgan, Amazon Executives Predict Deep Job Cuts as AI Advances Worldpay Launches Domestic Acquiring Capabilities in Thailand We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip. ELITE US UNIVERSITIES PARTNER WITH ARM OF QATARI GOVERNMENT PUSHING ANTI-AMERICAN MEDIA Crockett also went on cultural exchange trips paid for by the Indian and Emirati governments, according to records. “The congresswoman files her financial disclosures and all required documents in accordance with federal law,” Crockett’s chief of staff told the Washington Examiner. 13 posted on 07/03/2025 8:12:39 AM PDT by Liz (This then is how we should pray...."Our Father, who art in heaven......" ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 BTTT 14 posted on 07/03/2025 8:13:28 AM PDT by nopardons [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: cuz1961 DNC should be footing the bill for the mass deportation. 15 posted on 07/03/2025 8:18:31 AM PDT by JudyinCanada (Praying that America's Golden Age includes Canada.)

Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization.

Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep.

People complain that DOGE didn’t cut $$ Trillions from the US budget I say - that was only its publicly stated purpose It was actually a political attack on the vast money-laundering operation that was Fed.gov funding of leftist NGOs and Democrat politicians. It employed tens of thousands of people, and funded the Left and their political operations for decades. When the BK court has them sell off their assets, who’s going to get congress?

Side note to the DNC: You can let Hillary do some of the baking. But keep her away from the money box. Crypto bros, corporations, and foreign governments: A look into who funds Jasmine Crockett By Robert Schmad March 27, 2025 5:00 am When Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Business An Nvidia logo is displayed on a building in Taipei, Taiwan, on Apr 16, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Ann Wang) Nvidia was on track to become the most valuable company in history on Thursday (Jul 2), with the chipmaker's market capitalisation reaching US$3.92 trillion as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about artificial intelligence. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2 per cent at US$160.60 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of US$3.915 trillion on Dec 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest AI models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of US$3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5 per cent to US$498.5.

Loading Apple rose 0.8 per cent, giving it a market value of US$3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centres and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.

It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eightfold over the past four years, from US$500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 per cent from its recent closing low on Apr 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4 per cent on the benchmark S&P 500. Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Though the near-term equity valuations have eased this year, the MSCI India index trades at a forward earnings multiple of about 22.5 — slightly above its 10-year average and nearly double that of broader emerging markets, it said. India’s strong growth outlook should support long-term earnings and justify this premium. “We prefer the equity risk premium as a valuation gauge as it incorporates growth and interest rate assumptions. Our estimate of India’s ERP is about 4.9 per cent — in line with its historical mean, suggesting valuations are not as stretched as multiples imply,” it said. In fixed income, BlackRock Investment Institute maintains a neutral stance on local currency bonds but sees scope to add selectively where real yields are compelling. Vivek Paul, Head of Portfolio Research, BlackRock Investment Institute, said India offers one of the most compelling opportunities across emerging markets for investors looking to tap into mega forces. A large and expanding working-age population, unlike many major economies, bode well for sustained gains in productivity and consumption, he said. India’s digital initiatives such as its unique identification system Aadhaar, scalable payments systems and the open network for digital commerce are widening access, revolutionising transactions and enabling new business models. However, execution risks around harnessing these innovations remain, said the report. On the physical side, capital is flowing into renewable energy, logistics corridors and digital highways — building the foundations for sustained expansion, it said. Infrastructure – at the intersection of several mega forces – is a key focus in 2025 and beyond. Historically, large-scale initiatives, particularly infrastructure and green projects, have relied heavily on domestic public sector funding, leading to higher borrowing costs. “We see private capital playing a larger role than before, opening new investment opportunities,” it said. “We keep a neutral stance on Indian equities in the short term but advocate for above benchmark allocations to Indian equities within strategic portfolios with investment horizons of five years as its economic transformation unfolds,” said the report. “India equities aren’t immune to global risk-off episodes, yet over the long term, we see compelling overlaps between India’s development priorities and our global investment themes,” it said.

Title: BlackRock Wants Bitcoin Higher—IBIT Now Out-Earns Their S&P 500 Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-higher-ibit-out-earns-sp-500-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T13:30:01Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has surpassed the firm’s long-established iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in annual revenue generation. The development, first highlighted in a June 2 report by Bloomberg, marks a milestone moment for institutional adoption and exposes a growing financial incentive among traditional giants to see BTC’s price rise. Despite being a fraction of IVV’s size in terms of assets under management, IBIT has now overtaken it in fee revenue. IBIT currently manages approximately $75 billion in assets and charges a 0.25% fee, generating around $187.2 million in estimated annual fees. In contrast, IVV, BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 tracker, holds $624 billion but charges just 0.03%, netting about $187.1 million in fees. As Bloomberg’s Isabelle Lee put it, “a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than [BlackRock’s] signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index.” This revenue discrepancy, despite IVV’s immense asset base, stems from the sheer profitability of managing BTC exposure in an ETF wrapper, particularly given IBIT’s higher fee structure and the velocity of capital inflows it has witnessed. The fund has recorded inflows in all but one of the past 18 months and now holds over 55% of all US spot Bitcoin ETF assets. The explosive growth of IBIT is closely tied to the January 2024 decision by US regulators to approve spot ETFs, a watershed moment that brought Bitcoin further into the financial mainstream. This regulatory opening has unleashed a torrent of institutional capital, with hedge funds, pensions, family offices, and banks now actively allocating to Bitcoin in SEC-compliant vehicles. Market commentators were quick to highlight the implications. Anthony Pompliano noted succinctly on X: “BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund. Bitcoin has Wall Street’s full, undivided attention now.” Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield provided a more detailed financial interpretation, posting: “Blackrock makes more money the higher the price of Bitcoin goes, just an FYI. (not financial advice)” He elaborated further: “Some people don’t seem to understand my meaning. Blackrock makes 0.25% fees on their IBIT ETF. That currently translates to $184 million in annual revenue (just for custody) and it’s based on AUM (assets under management). That means if the price of Bitcoin goes to $1,000,000 (a 10X from here), they will make $1.84 billion per year in fees. This is why Blackrock is incentivized by higher prices in Bitcoin.” Canfield’s logic lays bare the core economic engine at work: BlackRock’s revenue from IBIT is a direct function of the BTC market price. Since ETF fees are derived as a percentage of AUM, any appreciation in price amplifies the dollar-denominated value of the assets under custody—and, by extension, BlackRock’s fee income. At current rates, each doubling of the BTC price could potentially yield nearly double the revenue for IBIT, assuming static inflows. The broader implication is profound: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion under management, is now structurally aligned with Bitcoin’s success. That alignment goes beyond product strategy or public messaging—it is embedded in fee economics. At press time, BTC traded at $109,240. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Microsoft is cutting more jobs as it continues AI push When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is cutting 9,000 jobs with most of those facing the ax being employed in the Gaming division. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said (via CNBC). The job cuts seek to reduce the layers of managers standing between individual contributors and top executives, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. Cutting jobs seems to be the growing trend for many large companies, with Microsoft cutting just under 1% of its workforce in January 2025. Another 6,000 workers, mostly programmers, were cut in May and a further 300 jobs cut in June. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.” Amazon has also gone through several waves of layoffs this year, with CEO Andy Jassy repeatedly saying that AI could replace some of its workers.

For Microsoft though, the layoffs are more to do with improving business performance and reducing internal friction. Intel has also lined up a significant wave of layoffs, with the company looking to cut 15-20% of its factory workforce. Intel already laid off 15,000 people in August 2024. But while Intel has been struggling with declining revenues and market performance, Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter.

Title: Apple’s Big AI Bet: Could Perplexity Be A Game Changer?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/07/03/apples-big-ai-bet-could-perplexity-be-a-game-changer/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T11:59:17Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. Apple and Artificial Intelligence Apple’s stock is down nearly 20% so far in 2025, making it the only Magnificent Seven member in the red. Acquiring Perplexity AI, a leading AI search engine, could immediately boost investor confidence and give Apple a chance to seize AI leadership. The stakes are clear: On June 28, 2025, Bloomberg revealed that Apple's M&A chief, Adrian Perica, had discussed acquiring Perplexity with services head Eddy Cue. Analysts estimate such a deal could cost between $25 and $30 billion, roughly twice Perplexity's last funding round valuation, and consistent with recent acquisition premiums paid for strategic AI properties. Days later, reports emerged that Apple is also weighing partnerships with Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT to power a new Siri. Apple is racing to close its AI gap through whatever means necessary. Industry experts and Wall Street analysts believe a Perplexity deal could recast Apple as an AI orchestration leader, extend its high-margin services through renewed hardware demand, and potentially trigger a valuation rerating. Disclaimer: This article is based solely on publicly available information, market reports, and the author's independent research and analysis. The author has no insider contacts at Apple, Perplexity, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Samsung, or any other company mentioned, and no direct knowledge of their internal strategies, acquisition decisions, or future plans. All strategic interpretations are speculative and intended for informational purposes only. Apple is reportedly considering acquiring Perplexity AI not just to buy another chatbot, but to build what could become the world’s first consumer AI orchestration platform. Instead of forcing users to choose between ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Search, its system would automatically call upon the best model for each task. This embodies Apple's 'it just works' philosophy, delivering seamless, intelligent experiences that are intuitive, invisible, and effortlessly powerful. This isn’t just about catching up in AI. It’s about redefining how humans interact with it. Using intent recognition (understanding what the user wants—like checking the weather vs drafting an email) and query analysis (figuring out the best way to answer—like searching real-time data vs explaining a concept), the system routes requests in milliseconds. Here's how it could work: For example, ask, 'Should I invest in Apple stock?' Perplexity pulls the latest market data and analyst commentary, with citations. ChatGPT explains investing principles and risk factors in conversational language. Apple Intelligence then combines everything into one smart, personalized response. Whether you're asking Siri a question, pointing your camera at a landmark, or drafting an email, each AI model contributes its unique strength, fused into one unified experience. Daily examples of this ambient intelligence include: "What's the weather?" → Apple Intelligence delivers local results on-device; "Cancel my meeting politely." → ChatGPT drafts the diplomatic email; "Any new research on quantum computing?" → Perplexity surfaces the latest studies; "Set a timer for 10 minutes." → Apple Intelligence handles it privately, on-device. Personal data remains protected on-device, with only anonymized queries sent to external services when necessary. Users retain override control, but most interactions become ambient and invisible. If Apple pursues an orchestration strategy, it would likely rely on each AI partner playing a specialized role. ChatGPT excels at conversation, Claude at reasoning, and Perplexity at real-time, citation-backed search. Unlike general LLMs, Perplexity is an AI-native search engine specialized for real-time, citation-backed answers atop these models. Think of Perplexity as Google Search reimagined for the AI era. Instead of giving you a list of blue links to sift through, it delivers direct, citation-backed answers in clear, conversational language, summarizing multiple sources so you can decide intelligently what to explore further. It also provides cues on related topics worth investigating. For example, when you ask “Should I buy Coinbase stock?”, Perplexity doesn’t just list articles. It offers a structured, conversational analysis including current price, valuation ratios, Morningstar fair value, fundamental risks, technical ratings, and professional opinions—all in one place—followed by suggested related questions like options strategies, historical comparisons, and upcoming catalysts. The acquisition logic becomes clear when comparing alternatives. ChatGPT's $300 billion valuation makes acquisition prohibitive, while partnerships suffice for conversational needs. Claude, valued at $61.5 billion, could cost $80–90 billion with market premiums, unjustifiable when licensing suffices. At a $14 billion last funding round valuation, Perplexity is the attainable target, with specialized search capabilities and an orchestration-ready architecture that appears well-suited to Apple’s potential orchestration approach. Apple and Perplexity Currently, Perplexity generates just under $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), doubling from ~$50 million in late 2024—a fraction of its potential under Apple’s vast distribution and financial moat. With more than 2.2 billion active devices, a premium user base, and seamless payment infrastructure, its revenue baseline could expand dramatically. Even at a 30% conversion rate among more than 2.2 billion devices, priced at $15 to $20 per month, consumer revenue alone could reach $2.4 to $3.2 billion annually. Enterprise markets offer additional upside, as AI tools command premium pricing: Microsoft Copilot starts at $30 per user monthly, Lexis+ runs around $300–400 per attorney per month, Westlaw starts near $133 and rises for advanced tiers, and Bloomberg Law costs roughly $6,000 per lawyer annually. Law firms spend up to $21,000 per attorney on specialized research tools, while major universities allocate up to $12.5 million annually to digital resources. Pre-installed across Apple’s ecosystem, Perplexity would gain instant reach unmatched by competitors, transforming it from a standalone service into a defensible, multibillion-dollar AI search powerhouse. Combined consumer and enterprise potential creates a clear path to recovering the estimated $30 billion acquisition cost within a decade or sooner, and could catapult Apple onto offense rather than leaving it on the defensive. Apple's current partnership with ChatGPT illustrates the limitations of relying on external AI providers. Each query requires user permission, incurs per-request costs, and faces security restrictions and delays due to routing through external providers. More importantly, these models cannot fully leverage Apple's Neural Engine architecture to deliver optimal performance. The Microsoft–OpenAI relationship offers a cautionary parallel. Despite Microsoft’s $13 billion investment, strategic tensions have emerged as it now competes directly with OpenAI in search, coding, and enterprise AI services. OpenAI has even considered filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft, and ongoing governance disputes continue to hinder both companies' strategic goals. Acquiring Perplexity AI could avoid these partnership pitfalls while delivering four key advantages. Seamless integration could eliminate permission prompts for factual queries, remove external API dependencies, and reduce latency through direct local processing. Hardware optimization could allow Perplexity's search models to run natively on Apple's M4 Neural Engine, minimizing network delays while maintaining privacy through unified memory architecture. The deal could also provide immediate talent acquisition—Apple would instantly gain proven AI experts who've already built a successful search-AI hybrid at scale. This specialized expertise could become crucial as Siri improvements remain delayed until at least 2026. Moreover, top talent attracts top talent: having Perplexity's team in-house could significantly enhance Apple's ability to recruit other leading AI researchers. Finally, cost efficiency could emerge from owning the highest-volume use case—factual queries—allowing Apple to avoid per-API-call expenses while continuing to license specialized conversational models only where necessary. This orchestration approach creates multiple competitive advantages: For users: No more wondering which AI tool to download or try, or AI app hopping. Just ask and get the best answer from whichever AI knows best. For Apple: It could deliver the unified experiences users expect from Apple and create true platform differentiation. While Android users juggle separate apps, iPhone users could get everything integrated intelligently. For competitors: In the face of Apple’s seamless AI orchestration, their offerings may quickly feel outdated and like disjointed point solutions. Microsoft’s Copilot could seem bolted-on, Google’s AI Overviews might remain limited to a single Gemini-driven perspective, and Meta could continue focusing mainly on social features. Just as the iPhone transformed how we used phones, Apple’s orchestration could transform how we use AI. On the other hand, if rivals like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon were to acquire Perplexity instead, they could embed it deeply at the OS level, leaving Apple to continue developing such solutions in-house, where it has seen only limited success so far. Acquiring Perplexity could put Apple on a fast track to deliver the premium “wow” experiences it is known for, securing advantages that could be extremely costly for competitors to counter. Samsung's reported partnership discussions with Perplexity this year add immediate pressure. Preferential Android access could not only weaken Apple's differentiation but also drive Perplexity's acquisition cost even higher. While Apple is late to AI, monetization remains largely unproven across the industry, giving it a rare chance to leapfrog competitors by executing orchestration better than anyone else. The challenges are significant. Bringing together multiple AI systems at Apple's scale will be an enormous engineering lift. Orchestrating requests in milliseconds without glitches demands flawless backend architecture. Apple's brand is built on privacy: even anonymized external queries could trigger user concerns if transparency isn't crystal clear. With Siri upgrades delayed to 2026, a 12 to 18-month Perplexity integration risks missing the AI wave entirely if rivals move faster. The estimated $30 billion price tag could rise further if other bidders enter the fray. These risks are real, but with AI becoming the next battleground, Apple may have no choice but to tackle them head-on if it wants to become a leader. The stakes are high. This move could trigger a valuation rerating and preserve Apple’s leadership in the next tech battleground. However, delay or indecision risks ceding ground to rivals and forfeiting a valuable strategic edge. This orchestration bet could redefine human-AI interaction, but only if Apple acts decisively before the window closes.

Title: How Lam Research Stock Gets To $200
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/03/how-lam-research-stock-gets-to-200/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T10:30:10Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Lam Research Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a prominent supplier of equipment for chip fabrication, is poised to gain from the increasing capital expenditures driven by the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence industry. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) grabs attention with its stock price soaring more than 3 times over the last two years and its valuation approaching $4 trillion, less known companies like Lam play an essential role in the manufacturing of the AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks may provide a more stable value with significant potential for upside. The data is persuasive. According to SEMI, capital expenditure on advanced chip-making equipment is expected to nearly double from 2023 to 2028, and global capex spending is anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Lam, which focuses on deposition and etching equipment—two of the foremost processes in chip production—may be well-positioned to seize a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s primary clients include industry titans like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, establishing it as a key player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Although traditionally dominant in memory chips, Lam is broadening its footprint in advanced logic chips and packaging technologies—fields that are witnessing increasing demand as chip design complexity escalates. AI tasks require not just advanced processing power but also high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and intricate stacking architectures. For instance, the fabrication of HBM chips is three times more wafer-intensive than standard DRAM because of lower bit density and the requirement for 3D stacking. This results in a direct increase in demand for tools manufactured by companies like Lam. Whereas chip designers such as Nvidia have experienced skyrocketing valuations, Lam's stock has lagged. Shares have decreased by approximately 9% over the past 12 months and presently trade at around 24 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 35 times. Indeed, the valuation disparity is partly attributable to Lam’s reliance on China, which represented 31% of revenues in the March quarter. Ongoing U.S. export restrictions have impacted this segment, likely restricting Lam's capacity to capitalize on the substantial Chinese market. According to consensus estimates, Lam's revenues are projected to grow by around 22% in FY25, although growth is expected to cool to roughly 2% in FY’26, in part due to these China-related challenges, with earnings also expected to remain flat. Nonetheless, if heightened demand related to AI, combined with a possible relaxation of chip equipment export restrictions to China, leads to sustained revenue growth at FY’25 rates of about 22% annually over the next three years, Lam's revenue could increase by around 1.8 times. Even if profit margins stay near current levels of 27% (as recorded over the first nine months of FY25), and if the valuation multiple rises to about 30 times (up from 24 times currently, a 1.25 times growth), the stock could potentially double from the current price of approximately $97 to over $200 per share. Several scenarios could lead to this outcome. Last week, the U.S. and China established a trade framework that encompasses rare earth exports and a potential relaxation of technology restrictions. If this easing of tensions applies to chip equipment exports, companies like Lam might gain renewed access to a vital growth market, further enhancing revenues. Furthermore, the process of chip manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital-intensive, meaning that a larger portion of the chip's expense is now equipment-related—a distinct advantage for companies like Lam. Additionally, advanced packaging methods, such as stacking and connecting multiple chips, which are already being used for AI tasks, should boost the demand for Lam’s high-end machinery. Certainly, Lam faces significant risks. Beyond the China issue, the memory chip arena, where Lam has historically excelled, is encountering pricing pressures. Flash memory prices have been declining due to decreased demand from consumer markets and capex in this sector has been subdued as key players reduce production. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, and U.S. tariffs could further obscure Lam’s short-term growth prospects. Although Lam is a highly specialized company with robust intellectual property, it may not enjoy the same protective barrier as a firm like ASML, which essentially has a monopoly over its trade of extreme ultraviolet lithography. On the other hand, Lam faces numerous competitors, such as Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron, which also provide similar services. That said, the long-term upcycle appears to be secure. The global semiconductor market is forecasted to surpass $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, rising from approximately $624 billion in 2024 according to the Wall Street Journal. As chip manufacturers adopt next-generation technologies to enable AI, the demand for sophisticated manufacturing tools is likely to remain high, directly benefiting Lam. While investing in a single stock like LRCX entails risk, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an adaptive means to maximize the advantages of favorable market conditions while curbing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: CEOs have a new AI flex

Full Content:
Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Good morning. If you’re in the habit of listening to CEOs, you’ll notice a new trend among leaders talking about AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent interview that AI now does up to 50% of all work at the company, in key functions like engineering, coding, and customer support. In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20% to 30% of the tech giant’s code is now written by AI coding assistants. And in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said over 30% of code at Google is now generated by AI. It’s the latest CEO flex: Citing numbers showing that AI is doing heavy lifting internally. The move presents the company as being ahead of the AI curve and invariably grabs the attention of people who matter. Investors hear the magic words that the business is on track to save money—presumably accomplished—but rarely explicitly stated, through future job cuts. It also signals to clients of the Big Tech companies making the pronouncements that they should open their wallets, pronto, to incorporate more AI into their operations, or risk falling behind. But how significant these CEO flexes ultimately are from Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft is difficult to know. The metrics cited seem precise, yet when asked, their spokespeople declined to provide any details about how the numbers were calculated or how they defined the work that they claim AI has done. “The truth is, we don’t yet have a common framework for measuring what ‘percent of work’ really means in the age of AI,” said Malvika Jethmalani, founder of human capital advisory firm Atvis Group, in a message to Fortune. “Are we counting lines of code, tasks completed, hours saved, or business outcomes influenced?” But Netherlands-based occupational psychologist Marais Bester thinks something else is afoot. “I think it’s also sort of an indicator to employees, saying, you better watch your back, you better perform.” From a business psychology standpoint, that’s not an indicator of good leadership, he added. Shonna Waters, an organizational psychologist and CEO of advisory firm Fractional Insights, thinks the companies that will succeed are those with “structural empathy”—that is, building systems that bring in frontline worker voices. “At the end of the day, you need the humans to still be the ones actually adopting the AI, you need to bring them along with your journey and figure out how to do it in concert with them, as opposed to something you’re doing to them.” You can read my full story for Fortune here. — Sharon Goldman More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill advances to final vote The debate went late into the night but expect the House to vote on the whole thing today. The president has not been happy with Congress’s delays. Axios has an interesting list of weird stuff that is in the gigantic act. FHFA head asks Congress to investigate Fed’s Powell Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, published a letter on X accusing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of giving deceptive testimony to Congress and demanding an investigation. President Trump then piled on with his own post calling for Powell to “resign immediately.” Reality check: Pulte did not provide specifics about what he believes Powell said wrongly. This is yet another extraordinary chapter in the book of Trump’s political tirades against his top central banker. Powell appears to have earned the president’s dislike simply because he has set monetary policy independently of the desires of the White House. CEOs are now openly saying AI will cut jobs The chief executives of Ford, Google, Amazon, Anthropic, and JPMorgan Chase have all openly stated that white-collar jobs will go into decline. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has said the company won’t hire new workers unless it can be proved that AI cannot do the job. Layoffs at Microsoft Microsoft is cutting around 9,000 jobs—almost 4% of its global workforce—in an effort to streamline operations and continue restructuring efforts. This is the biggest round of layoffs Microsoft has had since 2023. ADP says jobs declined The private sector is shrinking and lost 33,000 jobs last month, per a new report from ADP. “Though layoffs continue to be rare,” said ADP’s chief economist Nela Richardson, “a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month.” Vietnam strikes trade deal with the U.S. The U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the U.S. and goods that have been “transshipped” through Vietnam will face a 40% tax. Scaramucci’s second act Eight years after his disastrous 11-day stint as White House spokesperson, Anthony Scaramucci has remade his life as one of the most influential podcasters in politics and finance via his ability to read the room and draw together some of the world’s most powerful and influential people. Apple alleges former employee stole trade secrets Apple is suing a former senior product design engineer for allegedly stealing files with proprietary information about the $3,500 Vision Pro headset before leaving the company. Plus, Apple alleges that their former employee “was not honest about his stated reason for leaving Apple,” as his next job was at competitor Snap Inc. Goldman Sachs on employment: “We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 85k in June, below consensus of 110k and the three-month average of +135k. On the positive side, the end of worker strikes will provide a 6k boost. On the negative side, big data indicators were soft, we estimate the termination of Temporary Protected Status for approximately 350k Venezuelan migrants in mid-May will impose a 25k drag, and we expect a 15k decline in federal government payrolls. We estimate that the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3% on a rounded basis,” per Jan Hatzius et al. ‘Massive’ investment in R&D leads China’s Honor to launch world’s thinnest foldable phone by Nicholas Gordon Melinda French Gates tells Oprah Winfrey she runs every major life decision by her three closest female friends: ‘They are my truth council’ by Alexa Mikhail Andy Jassy’s latest canvas for reinvigorating Amazon’s cultural DNA?

Title: Microsoft Cuts 9,000 Jobs, Cancels Xbox Games Including Perfect Dark Reboot

Microsoft is cutting jobs once again. After laying off some employees in the gaming division in January and around 6,000 employees across various verticals in May, the company on Wednesday confirmed to The Seattle Times that it is reducing its workforce once again by almost 4%. The latest round of layoffs is part of “organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Gizmodo. Microsoft hasn’t confirmed which departments are affected or how many employees have been let go. The Redmond-based company had 228,000 employees as of June 2024. After reducing the recent job cuts, 4% of the workforce would translate to nearly 9,000 employees. Gaming is among the departments that have taken a major hit. “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Xbox leader Phil Spencer writes in a memo to employees, viewed by IGN. Those affected will be contacted by HR and be provided with severance benefits as required by local laws, including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, Spencer notes. Those eliminated from Xbox can apply for open roles across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority, he adds. Following Spencer’s statement, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty confirmed to employees that it would be cancelling the development of games like Everwild, Perfect Dark, and several other announced projects. These developments follow a Bloomberg report from last month that said thousands of Microsoft jobs would be cut after the end of the fiscal year in June. That report suggested marketing and sales teams could take the biggest hit; however, the latest reports indicate gaming has been affected more than other departments. We have reached out to Microsoft for further clarification regarding the departments affected and the number of workers let go. The months and years ahead may continue to be tough for tech employees. Intel is planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles, while Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already warned employees that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer in the next few years. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: Space comms reaches commercialisation inflection point

Time Published: 2025-07-03T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
Ubotica Research from the GSMA has found that the satellite-based communications industry is now transitioning from the pilot and validation stage to initial commercial deployments, with 109 telco-satellite partnerships now covering 70% of global mobile subscribers, and commercialisation set to unfold over the next two to three years as services evolve from SMS to voice to data. The Satellite and NTN tracker, Q2 2025 from the analysis arm of the global mobile industry trade association, GSMA Intelligence, highlighted the current competition in the market, and in addition to uncovering the increased amount of commercialisation found in the three months to the end of May 2025, key events in the sector included Starlink still dominating the industry – but with competition intensifying; Amazon’s Kuiper constellation entering the space race; and enterprise internet of things (IoT) presenting a large opportunity. The report noted that the total number of 109 operators with services was an increase of four players compared with the end of February 2025, and that 27 of these were now live, an increase of two compared with the prior quarter and 82 in testing, two more than previously. Out of a total mobile connections footprint of 5.72 billion, the share of the total connections base covered by satellite and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) was 66%, up two percentage points on February 2025. Yet out of all the activity in the market, the GSMA noted that Amazon’s launch of its first 27 out of 3,200 planned Kuiper constellation satellites represented the biggest competitive development of the second quarter of 2025. At 0.8% of target capacity, the analysis regarded the launch as a “small but significant” step for the tech giant. GSMA Intelligence believes Amazon’s strategic objectives will initially lie in the broadband market – either “not spots” or against higher-priced legacy ISPs in rural areas – and in ubiquitous, global coverage for its logistics operations. Intentions for direct-to-cell (D2C) services were seen as less obvious considering the potential oversupply of capacity and the fact it doesn’t have a clear link to Amazon’s core businesses. The report stressed, though, that Amazon’s D2C ambitions could not be ruled out given the company’s history of entering new business areas. One of the potentially interesting forthcoming battles will be between Kuiper and market leader Starlink, which was top in the market with 7,000 satellites and 10 telco partnerships. However, the study also observed that AST SpaceMobile has secured 30 planned telco relationships and that China’s national satellite efforts and established players like SES, Viasat and Iridium are preparing 2026 direct-to-cell launches, intensifying competitive pressure. The report predicted that Starlink was likely to sustain its first-mover advantage, as AST’s service is unlikely to be widely available until 2026 and Lynk’s coverage does not largely overlap with Starlink. However, GSMA Intelligence stressed this was not a 12-month game. D2C services from MSS providers, notably Viasat, SES and Iridium, are likely to come in 2026, in the S and L bands, and so, said the analyst, commercialisation was likely to play out over a two- to three-year period rather than being won or lost in the near term. GSMA Intelligence suggested bigger questions concern service evolution (SMS to voice to data) and the viability of being able to offer these to a critical mass, considering the spectrum constraints and natural barriers due to the laws of physics. In its previous report for Q1 2025, GSMA Intelligence noted that the IoT was of great interest given that the latest standards (Release 19) in the sector now incorporate new functionality for NTN services geared at IoT applications such as sensors, telematics and energy monitoring. The survey found that 2.5-3.0B IoT devices were now addressable by satellite across logistics, agriculture and utilities. The survey data showed the big opportunity for the sector, with 20% of businesses facing daily critical operations delays from connectivity gaps, with a further 30% reporting weekly issues. Equipment maintenance, supply chain efficiencies and asset tracking are the top three categories of operations where satellite is seen as playing a supporting role. GSMA Intelligence said the study highlighted that there was a window of opportunity to service this demand, and emphasised the need for versatility in satellite connectivity for transient assets.

BNY Mellon has introduced AI-powered workers with company logins that operate autonomously. They handle tasks like coding, payment validation and vulnerability detection without direct oversight. BNY Mellon's first two AI personas were built in three months, with plans to integrate email and Teams accounts. Goldman Sachs has deployed an AI assistant to 10,000 employees, aiming for firmwide rollout by year-end. Tools like Goldman's "GS AI Assistant" proofread documents, translate code, and may soon execute complex tasks. JPMorgan's internal chatbot is used by 230,000 staff, signaling widespread AI integration. Banks debate AI autonomy levels, while Bloomberg predicts 200,000 finance jobs may disappear by 2028 as AI takes over middle-office functions â reshaping traditional employment definitions. AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster.

AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster. Banks aim to balance human-AI collaboration, but the workforce will look fundamentally different as "bots join payroll." The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) has quietly ushered in a new era of workplace automation, deploying "digital employees" powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These digital employees are equipped with their own credentials such as company logins, just like their human counterparts. They also operate autonomouslyÂ âÂ validating transactions, identifying software vulnerabilities and communicating with human managers, all without direct oversight. BNY Chief InformationÂ Officer (CIO) Leigh-Ann Russell said BNY Mellon's initial two AI personas were developed in just three months, and were assigned to specific teams to restrict data access. One was designed to handle coding duties, and the other was assigned to do payment validation. Soon, they will gain email and Microsoft Teams accounts â blurring the line between human and machine collaboration. "This is the next level," Russell told the Wall Street Journal. "In six months, it will become very, very prevalent." Goldman Sachs has similarly rolled out an AI assistant to 10,000 bankers and traders, with plans to expand firmwide by year's end. Dubbed "GS AI Assistant," the tool proofreads documents, translates code and may soon execute multi-step tasks like a seasoned employee. Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti envisions AI evolving to "reason" like a company veteran, generating solutions without explicit instructions. "People are going to be the ones that evolve the AI," he told CNBC, downplaying fears of mass layoffs. Yet, Bloomberg estimates up to 200,000 finance jobs could vanish by 2028 as AI handles middle-office functions. (Related:Â Bill Gates predicts AI will replace humans in most roles within a decade.) How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past.

How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past.

One was designed to handle coding duties, and the other was assigned to do payment validation. Soon, they will gain email and Microsoft Teams accounts â blurring the line between human and machine collaboration. "This is the next level," Russell told the Wall Street Journal. "In six months, it will become very, very prevalent." Goldman Sachs has similarly rolled out an AI assistant to 10,000 bankers and traders, with plans to expand firmwide by year's end. Dubbed "GS AI Assistant," the tool proofreads documents, translates code and may soon execute multi-step tasks like a seasoned employee.

Title: Microsoft to cut up to 9,000 jobs as it invests in AI
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl0w1w394o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D

Microsoft has confirmed that it will lay off as many as 9,000 workers, in the technology giant's latest wave of job cuts this year. The company said several divisions would be affected without specifying which ones but reports suggest that its Xbox video gaming unit will be hit. Microsoft has set out plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), and is spending $80bn (£68.6bn) in huge data centres to train AI models. A spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: "We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The cuts would equate to 4% of Microsoft's 228,000-strong global workforce. Some video game projects have reportedly been affected by them. According to an internal email seen by The Verge and gaming publication IGN, Microsoft has told gaming staff that the planned reboot of first-person shooter series Perfect Dark, along with another title, Everwild, will be cancelled. The Initiative, a Microsoft-owned studio behind the Perfect Dark reboot, will also be shut down, the memo stated. Job cuts have also affected staff across wider studios owned by Microsoft, including Forza Motorsport maker Turn 10 and Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, according to employee posts on social media seen by the BBC. Matt Firor, studio director of ZeniMax Online Studios, announced on Wednesday he would be leaving his position in July after more than 18 years at the studio. "While I won't be working on the game anymore, I will be cheering you on and adding to the thousands of hours I've already spent in-game," said a post attributed to Mr Firor by ZeniMax on X. Romero Games Ltd, an independent studio based in Galway, Ireland - co-founded by Doom developer John Romero - has also cut staff after funding for its game was axed by its publisher. "These people are the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected," said Mr Romero in a post on X. Microsoft has initiated three other rounds of redundancies so far in 2025, including in May when it said it would cut 6,000 roles. An official database maintained by Washington state shows that more than 800 of the positions eliminated will be concentrated in the city of Redmond as well as in Bellevue, another Microsoft hub in its home state. In recent years, like many other big technology firms, Microsoft has refocussed its business towards developing AI, including investing in data centres and chips. Last year, the company hired British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman to lead its new Microsoft AI division. A top Microsoft executive recently told the BBC that the next half century will "fundamentally be defined by artificial intelligence,", changing the way we work and interact with one another. Microsoft is also a major investor and shareholder in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, although the relationship has reportedly grown tense in recent months. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft has struggled to sell its AI assistant, known as Copilot, to business customers because many office workers prefer ChatGPT. The layoffs among rank and file workers at Microsoft come as major US tech companies court top AI talent. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has been poaching talent from rivals to form a 'superintelligence' lab. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally involved in recruitment. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said recently that members of his team had been getting offers of more than $100m (£74.3m) as "signing bonuses" from Meta. Last month, Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he expected AI would replace some of his firm's workers.

Title: Korean Internet Giant Kakao Teams With Open AI To Jumpstart Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2025/07/02/korean-internet-giant-kakao-teams-with-open-ai-to-jumpstart-growth/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T02:00:56Z
Full Content:
ByJohn Kang ByJohn Kang, Forbes Staff. Shina Chung and Sam Altman are hoping for a win-win. Striding purposefully across the stage at a packed media briefing held in Seoul in early February, Shina Chung, CEO of Korean internet giant Kakao, leaned in to greet OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman. After six months of negotiations, the two companies had just sealed a partnership that would give Kakao (market cap: $20 billion) access to the American AI titan’s powerful technology. As Chung declared on stage, it could potentially turn “all imaginable AI-era services into reality”—and give Kakao a fighting chance to leapfrog the competition. With OpenAI’s help, Kakao hopes to realize its ambitions of being at the forefront of providing hyper-personalized services to the 49 million users of its ubiquitous superapp KakaoTalk, which equals about 94% of the country’s population. Chung is targeting a November rollout of so-called AI agents—next generation virtual assistants that can go beyond answering basic questions to making decisions and even taking actions on behalf of users. Shina Chung, CEO of Kakao “We needed a partner we could trust, especially one who leads the field in performance and innovation,” says Chung in an exclusive interview with Forbes Asia at Kakao’s office in Pangyo, South Korea’s Silicon Valley, just south of Seoul. “We had the same philosophy.” For Kakao and its first woman CEO, the OpenAI alliance could be nothing less than a game-changer. Since taking the top job in March 2024, Chung’s biggest challenge is to steer the company through the longest stretch of sluggish sales in its 15-year history. The 50-year-old Chung, who featured on Forbes Asia’s Power Businesswomen list last year, is betting that going all-in on AI will be a catalyst for growth. “We are now preparing to significantly change KakaoTalk so that AI can penetrate its many services,” she says. The collaboration isn’t a one-way deal. For OpenAI, it offers an opportunity to further its global ambitions by providing access to one of the world’s most tech-savvy markets, which has the highest number of paying subscribers outside the U.S. for ChatGPT, its revolutionary chatbot. “We’re excited to bring advanced AI to Kakao’s millions of users and work together to integrate our technology into services that transform how Kakao’s users communicate and connect,” says OpenAI’s chief product officer Kevin Weil by email. Just the day before the glad-handing event with Chung, Altman was in Tokyo with SoftBank’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, announcing a new joint venture to market AI services to Japanese companies. SoftBank recently led a $40 billion funding round in OpenAI and the two companies are also partners in the $500 billion Stargate project to build AI data centers in the U.S. Jaehyun Kim For Forbes ASIA It’s a critical turning point for Kakao. The company’s business is dependent on the Korean market—compared with blue-chip stalwarts like Samsung and Hyundai whose fortunes are determined by global exports—which faces a deepening economic slump. The country’s GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter amid the threat of a global trade war, weak consumer spending and months of political turmoil. In 2024 the company narrowed its net loss to 161.9 billion won ($119.4 million) from 1.82 trillion won the previous year, on a 4% uptick in revenue to 7.87 trillion won. The alliance with OpenAI could yield as much as double-digit sales growth within two years, according to Kakao as it transforms itself into a company where AI is at the core of its operations and services. Percentages have been rounded. Chung will need to act fast to hard-bake the fast-evolving tech into Kakao’s businesses, which run the gamut of everyday activities, from messaging and online banking to music streaming and taxi-hailing, to gain an edge on its chief rival Naver, South Korea’s biggest internet company by revenue (2024: 10.73 trillion won). The Seongnam-based firm is widely seen as being a step ahead of Kakao in the AI race with its large language model (LLM) HyperClova X, launched in 2023 and tailored for the Korean language and culture. Also closing in is a fast-growing crop of local AI native startups. “The AI agent will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is.” Already Chung has begun laying the foundation. In mid-June, the company announced a 600-billion-won investment to build a 92,000-square-meter AI data center in Namyangju city, about 25 kilometers from Seoul. The data center—its second after last year’s launch of a facility in Ansan with 6 billion gigabytes of data storage capacity—will break ground in 2026 and is slated to open by 2029. By leveraging OpenAI’s LLMs, which undergird ChatGPT, Kakao is developing a suite of services with the aim of getting users to increase their time on the superapp—and spend more money while using it. “We saw diminishing returns trying to compete in the benchmark tests for the most powerful AI models, so we decided on a more practical approach seeking cost efficiency,” says Chung. OpenAI-powered AI agents have the potential to autonomously plan and take action across Kakao’s digital ecosystem, with limited human direction; for example, make a restaurant booking on behalf of a KakaoTalk user, add a calendar reminder, book a taxi and pay for a meal. That stickiness, Chung believes, will result in more ads—one of Kakao’s main revenue drivers—reaching users across its chats and channels. “AI enhances our core business, especially advertising and commerce,” she says. Advertising accounted for 15% of group revenue last year while its commerce unit contributed 11%. Kakao earns commissions of up to 8% per transaction for gifts sent between KakaoTalk users. An average of 600,000 gifts (from chocolate to vitamins to cosmetics and clothes) are exchanged daily, the company says, in the form of mobile vouchers that can be redeemed at participating restaurants and retailers or ordered from the platform’s gift shop. “The advertising business, which currently operates as the main cash cow of internet companies, will undergo dynamic changes with the introduction of AI-based services,” says Jingu Kim, a Seoul-based analyst at Kiwoom Securities. He predicts there will be a rapid uptake in B2C-based subscription plans that include AI agent services. “In this process, we expect that Kakao will be able to secure sustainable growth and level up its corporate value through its collaboration with OpenAI.” A Kakao Friends store selling character merchandise such as Ryan (the lion) and the radish-in-rabbit clothing Muzi. In a dry run with OpenAI’s tech in early May, Kakao launched a new standalone messaging app called Kanana for closed beta testing that features AI agents Kana and Nana. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT and its own small language model (SLM), it can assist users in personal and group chats by answering questions, summarizing group conversations, setting meeting times for events and sharing updates. Kakao declined to say how much it has spent but discloses that some 400 employees, or about 10% of its workforce, are working on AI projects. “For everyday-use cases, we don’t need to [invest in] a large language model,” says Chung, as that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to develop. Besides being cheaper to train and run, SLMs are safer to use as they’re less likely to provide incorrect answers to user queries, known as hallucinations, while also being more secure, she adds. It doesn’t require a network connection to a cloud, which is vulnerable to server breaches. Kakao will use its SLM to perform simple tasks, while relying on OpenAI’s powerful LLM to manage more complex, multistep and linked applications across Kakao’s ecosystem, says Chung. It’s the same strategy used by Apple: simple queries are answered by Siri, powered by Apple’s in-house Apple Intelligence LLM, and more complex questions are directed to ChatGPT. “Everyone was defaulting to GPUs for AI, but does it make sense to use the most expensive chips for small inference tasks?” explains Chung. A taxi operated by Korea Mobility. The company expects to complete Kanana’s closed beta testing in November, around the same time that it plans to launch the OpenAI-Kakao AI agent. “The virtual assistant will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is,” says Chung. “Because now you need to find which app to use, go to the app, take action. With agentic AI it will be seamless.” Alongside her tech focus, Chung has been striving to make Kakao leaner. This has involved shedding non-core businesses—the number of affiliates has dropped by a fifth over the past two years to 115 from 147, the company says. Then there’s the planned spin-off of Daum, the country’s second-largest portal site by daily visitors, which Kakao acquired in 2014. This will allow Chung to concentrate on juicing up other parts of Kakao’s portfolio, both domestic and overseas, and in particular its banking, entertainment and digital healthcare services. In June, a joint venture between its internet banking arm Kakao Bank and Thai financial group SCBX, which controls Siam Commercial Bank, received approval from the Thai government to establish a virtual bank in Thailand, making it the first Korean bank to operate in the country in 25 years. Earlier this year Kakao Entertainment announced the global launch of its fan-community app Berriz as Kakao Healthcare forged a partnership with Seoul-based elderly-care startup Caring and expanded into Japan. Source: Kakao Kakao’s sales started to lose steam after peaking at 2 trillion won in the third quarter of 2023. With the company being under pressure to boost revenue and earnings, founder Kim Beom-su embarked on an aggressive expansion of its entertainment portfolio. Kim, who has a 24% stake in Kakao and a net worth of $5.1 billion, made the fate­ful call to get into a bidding war for K-pop agency SM Entertainment with Korean billionaire Bang Si-hyuk’s Hybe, manager of boy band sensation BTS. While Kakao was ultimately successful, snatching a 35% stake in SM for 1.3 trillion won in March 2023, prosecutors alleged that Kim, long-hailed as an internet pioneer, had manipulated SM’s stock price to ward off Hybe. Kim, who denied any wrongdoing, was arrested in July 2024 and is currently out on bail awaiting trial. In a statement to Kakao employees at the time, he said: “The allegations are not true. I have never instructed or condoned any illegal acts.” A crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” During the takeover battle for SM, Chung was running venture capital arm Kakao Ventures and also had a board seat at Kakao. She had made a name for herself as a VC investor with a portfolio that produced four unicorns. To steady the ship, Kakao’s board enlisted Chung as CEO last year. “I saw that period as a turning point for Kakao,” she recalls, adding that a crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” Chung’s forward-looking approach was honed over a 25-year career that has included roles at Boston Consulting Group, eBay and Kakao rival Naver. Chung studied French literature at Yonsei University in Seoul (not because she particularly liked French lit, she says, but because back then it was the subject du jour among brainy female students), followed by a master’s degree in marketing from the same college and an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. Photo by Jaehyun Kim for Forbes Asia In 2014, she joined Kakao Ventures as a partner, becoming its CEO four years later. Her decade-long stint at the VC arm taught her how to deploy “my imagination with curiosity,” she says. “For example, the market for most early-stage investments wasn’t there yet, so I needed to imagine it.” She did just that with Kakao Ventures’ early backing of South Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions, contributing 2 billion won of the 5.5 billion won in seed funding in 2020. Last December, Rebellions became the country’s first AI chip unicorn, valued at 1.3 trillion won, equivalent to $1 billion at the time, after it merged with a rival chipmaker owned by Korean billionaire Chey Tae-won’s SK Group (Kakao retains a stake). It’s not a given that Chung’s big tech bet will pay off. There are concerns in the industry that AI agents are more hype than substance, and could struggle to gain traction with users, much like Facebook’s metaverse, which saw the social media giant rebrand itself Meta and pour tens of billions of dollars into a virtual world project that has so far flopped. Alongside OpenAI, tech firms Google, Anthropic and Salesforce have debuted AI agents for consumers and businesses but they are nowhere near mainstream. OpenAI is also restricted in its use of personal data collected from Kanana agents, per a government review requested by Kakao over concerns about sharing personal information such as bank account and credit card details. Chat data must be stored in a database controlled by Kakao and can’t be used by OpenAI for commercial purposes, the Personal Information Protection Commission ruled. Kakao Pay is accepted at stores throughout South Korea. For now, a campaign promise by South Korea’s new president Lee Jae-myung to invest 100 trillion won in AI and introduce measures to support the country’s internet giants has led Kakao’s previously moribund shares to surge over 85% in the past two months. Investors also piled in over a proposed law that would allow companies in South Korea to issue won stablecoins, with Kakao’s listed payments platform Kakao Pay seen as one of the main beneficiaries. Kakao Pay shares rocketed before correcting sharply recently after regulators highlighted the risks associated with stablecoins. Chung’s shown the stamina and smarts to meet such challenges and has a secret weapon up her sleeve: imagination. “It will work very well,” she says. “Especially when new eras come.”

Major U.S. equities indexes finished Wednesday mixed as President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Vietnam. Private payroll data released Wednesday morning showed an unexpected decline in employment levels in June, the latest signal of a softening in the labor market that could influence the Federal Reserve as policymakers weigh interest-rate cuts. Investors will get a more comprehensive look at the employment situation with Thursday morning's jobs report. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5%, notching its first all-time closing high of the third quarter and its second record close this week. The Nasdaq was up 0.9%, joining the S&P 500 in record closing territory, while the Dow finished with a small loss of less than 0.1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Centene (CNC) shares plummeted 40%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the company withdrew its full-year guidance. The managed-care provider, which focuses on Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage, cited reports showing a steeper-than-expected growth slowdown in 22 of its 29 marketplaces, while patient illness was significantly higher compared with previous risk-adjustment assessments. Other health insurance stocks also came under pressure: Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Elevance Health (ELV), which also concentrate on government-sponsored plans, tumbled 22% and 12%, respectively. Shares of health insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH) were down 5.7%. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, rose 8.1%, notching the best performance in the S&P 500 and reaching their highest level since a sharp decline hit the stock in April. Although oversupply concerns have pushed prices for the key battery ingredient sharply lower over the past year, lithium prices edged higher on Wednesday. Like other major producers, Albemarle has responded to the challenging price environment with cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions and cutbacks to capital expenditure plans. Coinbase Global (COIN) said it has purchased the token-management platform Liquifi, the latest in a string of acquisitions for the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. Liquifi is designed to help with early stage projects, and Coinbase stressed that the deal will advance its goal of making it easier for organizations to navigate the challenges associated with building on-chain. Coinbase shares added 5.7%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.5% after the biotech firm's experimental flu vaccine based on messenger RNA technology showed promising results in a late-stage clinical trial. The company's head of research and development indicated that Moderna intends to file for approval of its standalone flu shot later this year as well as resubmit its previously withdrawn application for a combination flu and COVID-19 shot. Intel (INTC) shares sank 4.3% following reports that CEO Lip-Bu Tan is evaluating a potential shift in the company's foundry strategy that would involve making a newer generation of chips available to outside customers. The move would require Intel to step away from manufacturing processes that it has invested in significantly over recent years, and semiconductor industry analysts reportedly said the related write-off could amount to billions of dollars. Analysts at Rothschild & Co Redburn downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to "sell" from "neutral," suggesting that generative artificial intelligence tools threaten Adobe's leadership in the market for content creation software. For instance, they wrote, AI tools that can generate images and videos from text prompts represent formidable competition for Adobe's creative products and services. In addition, competitor Figma filed for an initial public offering after regulatory concerns hampered Adobe's acquisition efforts. Adobe shares fell 3.5% on Wednesday.

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world just happened to the job market? The unexpectedly bad numbers that have just come in have truly been a shock to many of us. Yes, we knew that conditions were getting worse during the early stages of this year. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has publicly admitted that the labor market “deteriorated noticeably” during the first quarter of 2025. But now it is becoming clear that our economic slide is threatening to become an economic avalanche. The U.S. economy needs to add approximately 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. Unfortunately, the latest monthly report from ADP shows that the U.S. economy actually lost jobs last month. Private sector employment dropped by 33,000 in June, and that was the very first decline that we have witnessed since 2023… Private sector hiring shrunk dramatically last month in a worrying sign for the the US economy. Private payrolls shed 33,000 jobs in June, but analysts had expected them to add 100,000, the latest ADP figures revealed. The worrying data – the first decrease since 2023 – suggests the US economy could be a lot less resilient than investors have been hoping. There is no way to spin this to make it look good. The labor market has gotten much tighter, and large companies all over the nation are trimming their payrolls right now. In particular, service jobs are being axed at a very alarming rate… The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000. Financial activity roles also contributed to the month’s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance. Personally, I believe that the numbers that we get from ADP are far more accurate than the highly manipulated numbers that we get from the federal government. But I also believe that the most accurate picture of the labor market comes from the monthly report that is released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. According to the latest report, U.S. employers announced a total of 744,308 job cuts during the first half of this year. The last time that we saw a larger figure was during the early days of the pandemic in 2020… Layoffs across the U.S. this year have climbed to their highest level since the pandemic slammed the economy in 2020, new labor data shows. In the first half of 2025, companies announced 744,308 job cuts nationwide, the highest tally since the first six months of 2020, when employers cut nearly 1.6 million jobs in response to COVID-related disruptions, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2020, we could blame the lockdowns for the layoffs. But this time around, there are no lockdowns. Retailers are being hit particularly hard. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retail job cuts during the first half of 2025 were 255 percent higher than they were during the first half of 2024… Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024. “Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,” Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry.” When I first started using the term “retail apocalypse”, a lot of people thought that I was exaggerating. Does anyone out there want to tell me that I am exaggerating now? Day after day, more big names go bankrupt. In fact, we just learned that Del Monte Foods has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy… Del Monte Foods kicked off efforts to pursue a sale as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US on Tuesday under an agreement with certain key lenders, the company said in a statement. The company has secured $912.5 million in financing to support itself through the proceedings, it said, adding that it intends to remain open and continue operations throughout the bankruptcy. The 139-year old company hosts names like canned fruits and vegetables brand Del Monte, College Inn, under which it sells broth and stocks, and tea brands like Joyba. I had no idea that they were in trouble. Of course even companies that are thriving are making cutbacks right now. On Wednesday, Microsoft confirmed that it will be laying off approximately 9,000 more workers… Microsoft is kicking off its fiscal year by laying off thousands of employees in the largest round of layoffs since 2023, the company confirmed Wednesday. In an ongoing effort to streamline its workforce, Microsoft said as much as 4%, or roughly 9,000, of the company’s employees could be affected by Wednesday’s layoffs. This latest round of layoffs comes in the aftermath of a round of layoffs in May and a round of layoffs in June… Wednesday’s move follows two waves of layoffs in May and June, which saw Microsoft fire more than 6,000 employees, almost 2,300 of whom were based in Washington. During May’s round of layoffs, Microsoft emphasized that it wanted to flatten management layers. But data from Washington state showed only about 17% of the cuts in Redmond were designated as managers. Why is Microsoft doing this? They are supposed to be one of our most successful companies. Speaking of successful tech companies, it is being reported that Amazon will be conducting “brutal workforce cuts”… Amazon’s CEO has announced brutal workforce cuts as the company increases its use of Artificial Intelligence. Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he plans to reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years as AI will make certain roles redundant. Jassy told employees in a note seen by the Wall Street Journal that AI was a once-in-a-lifetime technological advancement and it has already transformed how Amazon operates. If our largest and most valuable companies are ruthlessly slashing workers, what does this say about our economy as a whole? Other corporate giants such as Google, UnitedHealthcare and Nissan are reducing workforce levels by offering buyouts to their employees… In the private sector, Google, UnitedHealthcare and Nissan, among others, have offered buyouts to U.S. workers this year. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. “It’s like lottery winners. Some people think the money lasts longer than it does,” said Donna Walton, wealth strategist at TD Wealth. A couple of years ago, corporate America was engaged in a hiring frenzy. But now the environment has completely changed. We all need to brace ourselves for what is ahead, because it appears that things will get even more challenging during the months to come.

Title: Microsoft: We Need A Lot Less Employees. And a Lot More AI Infrastructure.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts 🚨 Microsoft's 2025 strategy in numbers: ❌ 15,300+ employees laid off (7% of workforce) YTD: •9,000 cuts announced July 2•6,000 cuts in May•300+ cuts in June•Performance cuts in January•and only halfway through year 💰 $80 billion invested in AI infrastructure 40%… pic.twitter.com/LJVfwStpW9 — Jason ✨👾SaaStr.Ai✨ Lemkin (@jasonlk) July 2, 2025 The tech giant’s massive workforce reductions coincide with record-breaking AI investments, signaling a fundamental shift in how Microsoft views its future workforce As the technology giant implements what amounts to its most aggressive workforce reduction campaign since 2014, eliminating approximately 15,300 employees across multiple rounds of cuts in just the first half of 2025 alone — while simultaneously committing $80 billion to AI infrastructure — the company is telegraphing a vision of the future where artificial intelligence increasingly replaces human labor. Microsoft is projecting 14%+ revenue growth this year, with up to 10% fewer employees: Microsoft’s 2025 workforce reductions have been extensive and systematic. The company announced in May that it would lay off about 6,000 people, followed by at least 300 more cuts in June, and most recently announced another 9,000 layoffs in July 2025. Combined with smaller performance-based cuts in January affecting less than 1% of headcount, Microsoft has eliminated approximately 15,300 positions in 2025 alone—representing nearly 7% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. These aren’t random cuts across the organization. In Microsoft’s home state of Washington, software engineering was by far the largest single job category to receive layoff notices, making up more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut in the May round. Microsoft announced its most recent round of cuts on July 2, 2025, affecting about 9,000 employees—less than 4% of its global workforce. This follows the May announcement of 6,000 layoffs, at least 300 additional cuts in June, and smaller performance-based reductions in January. As one person familiar with the matter told CNBC, Microsoft is continuing to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives. The escalating pace of job cuts is particularly striking given Microsoft’s strong financial performance and comes after CEO Satya Nadella revealed that up to 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI, with Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicting that number could hit 95% by 2030. Meanwhile, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion in AI-enabled datacenters around the world during fiscal year 2025 – a significant increase from the $53 billion capex spend Microsoft made in 2023. Microsoft isn’t alone in its workforce reduction strategy. The tech industry’s largest companies have all implemented significant layoffs in 2025, with CEOs increasingly linking these cuts to AI adoption and efficiency gains. Meta: Mark Zuckerberg announced in January that Meta would cut approximately 5% of its workforce—about 3,600 employees—targeting what he called “low performers” to make room for AI investments. In his internal memo, Zuckerberg stated: “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams. I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.” Google/Alphabet: Sundar Pichai announced a 10% reduction in managerial roles as part of Google’s yearlong push for efficiency. Despite this, Pichai has taken a more optimistic stance on AI’s impact, telling Bloomberg: “I expect we will grow from our current engineering base even into next year, because it allows us to do more. AI is an accelerator that will drive new product development, thereby creating demand for more employees.” Amazon: Andy Jassy was the most direct about AI’s impact, telling employees that “we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” as the company adopts more AI tools. Amazon has already laid off more than 27,000 employees since 2022, and Jassy stated: “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The pattern is consistent across Silicon Valley: while revenue and AI investments soar, human workforces are being systematically reduced in favor of automated alternatives. While Microsoft has characterized the layoffs as organizational restructuring to “reduce layers of management”, industry observers see a different pattern emerging. Paul Roetzer of the Marketing AI Institute calls it “quiet AI layoffs”—job cuts that are ostensibly about cost savings or restructuring, but are actually driven by a belief that AI can replace (or reduce the need for) human labor. The evidence supports this interpretation. Relatively fewer sales or marketing positions were affected in the recent layoffs, while technical roles bore the brunt of the cuts. This suggests Microsoft isn’t simply trimming costs—it’s reallocating resources based on where it believes AI can most effectively substitute for human workers. Microsoft has also mandated AI use across its workforce, making it a part of employees’ daily workflow and performance evaluations, further cementing AI’s role in the company’s operations. Microsoft isn’t alone in this transformation. So far in 2025, more than 22,000 workers have been laid off across the tech industry, with many companies citing AI investments as a strategic priority. Meta announced performance-based layoffs of about 5% in January and Salesforce said it would be laying off about 1,000 employees as it redoubles its AI efforts. The pattern is clear: as AI capabilities expand, companies are betting they can maintain or increase productivity with fewer human employees. Analyst Gil Luria told Reuters that with consistent investments of this scale over the next few years, Microsoft may continue to lay off 10,000 workers to “make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures”. Microsoft’s massive infrastructure investment reflects the enormous computational requirements of modern AI systems. More than half of Microsoft’s $80 billion investment will be in the United States, positioning the company to compete in what Microsoft president Brad Smith describes as a “golden opportunity” for American economic competitiveness. Smith described AI as set to become a “world-changing general-purpose technology” and stated that “AI offers not only new tools for people’s work but also new ways to help people learn almost anything”. However, the irony isn’t lost on employees: the same technology promising to enhance human capabilities is simultaneously displacing human workers. The infrastructure investment is also driven by competitive pressures. Having invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, Microsoft provides cloud infrastructure to the startup and has incorporated its models into Windows, Teams and other products. Microsoft’s revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 33% in the fiscal first quarter, with 12 percentage points stemming from AI services. The implications for Microsoft’s workforce—and knowledge workers more broadly—are profound. If AI is increasingly building the software, companies need fewer people to do that job. The fact that coders were hit hardest among Microsoft’s layoffs while customer-facing roles were largely untouched suggests that companies see AI as most immediately capable of replacing technical rather than interpersonal work. This creates a challenging atmosphere where “it is obvious to most that their performance does not guarantee a successful career, despite the company’s earlier announcement of a stringent performance policy”. Employees can no longer assume that strong performance will protect them from AI-driven displacement. Microsoft’s transformation continues with the July 2025 announcement of 9,000 additional layoffs, bringing the year’s total workforce reduction to over 15,000 employees. The company’s announcement came on the second day of Microsoft’s 2026 fiscal year, reflecting a pattern where executives typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year. Microsoft executives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions—growth areas heavily dependent on AI infrastructure rather than human workforce expansion. These moves signal that Microsoft’s workforce reduction isn’t a one-time adjustment but an ongoing transformation representing one of the most aggressive restructuring campaigns in the company’s 50-year history, surpassed only by the elimination of 18,000 employees in 2014 following the Nokia acquisition. For Microsoft, the equation is straightforward: why maintain expensive human capital when AI can perform many of the same functions at scale? As Smith noted, the company sees AI infrastructure as “the essential foundation of AI innovation and use”—a foundation that, increasingly, doesn’t require as many human builders. The message from Redmond is clear: In Microsoft’s vision of the future, there’s room for either extensive human workforces or massive AI infrastructure investments, but not both.

Title: Beyond Nvidia: 5 Lesser-Known AI Stocks Poised For Growth To Buy Now

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia is not the sole beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is the best-known company capitalizing on the generative AI boom that began in 2023, when ChatGPT quickly scaled to over 100 million users. In fact, it was Nvidia’s first-quarter 2023 report, which featured a decline in revenue and forecast huge growth, that made me realize a new technology wave was building akin to the internet boom of the 1990s. Nvidia’s prospects gave me the kick to write a book, Brain Rush, published last year. Since then I have continued to track publicly-traded companies that benefit from growth in demand for generative AI. In my book I mapped out the generative AI value network, including AI chip producers, data center technology makers, cloud services providers, large language model builders, generative AI application developers and AI business consultants. From this network, I created an index of publicly-traded companies in the generative AI ecosystem. Based on the performance of this index, I have identified five lesser-known AI stocks poised for growth. CoreWeave is a New Jersey-based provider of cloud computing services for AI developers and enterprises. Its stock market value has soared 308% since it went public in March. CoreWeave’s stock rise can be attributed to the company’s torrid revenue growth – up 420% in the quarter ending in March, according to a CoreWeave investor letter. Retail investor interest in the company and partnerships with leading AI companies have also contributed to the stock’s performance. Specifically, CoreWeave partners with Nvidia, which Fortune reported invested in CoreWeave before it went public, as well as OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. CoreWeave is on my list because its exceptional growth exceeded my expectations and its stock-price increase leads the pack of Nvidia peers. Prior to the company’s initial public offering, I highlighted key risks – CoreWeave’s dependence on a few large customers, the company’s heavy debt load and the CEO’s lack of experience running a public company. But if the company can keep exceeding high growth expectations, its shares could rise more. Denver-based Palantir Technologies provides software to help public and private-sector clients identify trends, detect fraud and optimize operations through big data analytics. It has enjoyed an 81.3% increase in its stock price in the first half of this year. Palantir achieved rapid growth and high profitability. For example, the company’s revenue increased 39.3% in the first quarter while generating an impressive 24.2% net profit margin, according to a Palantir investor letter. Why is Palantir on a list of AI stocks? Palantir is one of the few companies that have been able to generate substantial revenue growth from the application of generative AI, as I wrote in February. Indeed with the exception of Nvidia, no other company has achieved such significant growth from generative AI-powered products. What’s more, Palantir recently raised its revenue growth forecast for the year from 31% to 36%. In addition to benefiting from government contracts provided by the Trump administration, Palantir stock could be propelled by potential contracts for projects such as the Golden Dome – a U.S. missile shield akin to Israel’s Iron Dome. Citi Research analyst Tyler Radke is not all smiles. Investor's Business Daily reported recently that after meeting with Palantir management, Radke wrote, "We continue to have concerns on how Palantir stock can grow into its valuation, especially if magnitude of positive revisions slow or large contracts (Golden Dome) don't materialize as expected." Snowflake, a Bozeman, Montana-based provider of data analysis services, has enjoyed a 42.1% increase in its share price during the first half of the year. While Snowflake is unprofitable, the company’s revenue grew nearly 26% in the quarter ending in April, CNBC reported. Behind the increase in Snowflake’s stock price are successful initiatives to integrate generative AI into the company’s products, as well as partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, according to CNBC. In addition, Snowflake exceeded investor expectations and raised its growth guidance. Snowflake is growing thanks to its new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, whom I interviewed in May 2024. When Ramaswamy took over as chief executive in February 2024, I was unsure whether he would be as successful as his predecessor, Frank Slootman, who handed over the top job because his successor had a deeper understanding of AI. Since then, Ramaswamy has given Snowflake’s generative AI strategy new life. Indeed, I am including Snowflake on my list because a Snowflake manager told me at a conference in San Francisco in May 2025 that Ramaswamy is doing an excellent job of leading the company’s AI product development. Shares of Meta Platforms, the social media parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, rose 23% in the first half of the year. In the first quarter of 2025, Meta reported 16.1% revenue growth and earned a whopping 39.3% net profit margin, according to Meta’s investor letter. The company has distinguished itself from rivals by using AI to help digital ad buyers sell more. In addition, Meta’s investments in AI-powered products such as Meta AI could become a new growth curve, as I wrote last October. Meta is on my list because the company is betting heavily on AI. Its new “Superintelligence Labs” unit, led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, could create new growth curves for the company, Barron’s reported. However, a note of skepticism is called for because Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bet big in the past – remember the metaverse, which drove the company’s name change from Facebook? That bet has produced billions of dollars worth of losses and does not appear poised to pay off. Nevertheless, Meta could surprise me if the company can attract and motivate the talent needed to surpass more focused rivals like OpenAI and Perplexity. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes the chips Nvidia and others design, have risen 12.3%, increasing steeply, since late April. TSMC grew revenue 41.6% in the first quarter and earned a 43% net profit margin, according to the company’s investor letter. While tariff uncertainty and geopolitical instability could threaten TSMC, a long-standing partnership with Nvidia could propel TSMC stock higher. Analysts project growth in TSMC’s AI-related revenue as high as 45% compounded annually through 2030, according to AInvest. If this prediction is realized, investors could benefit from owning TSMC stock. Bottom Line Nvidia is not the sole beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Other companies who play in the AI ecosystem – CoreWeave, Palantir, Snowflake, Meta Platforms and TSMC – may also enjoy big increases in their stock prices. Investors should consider whether to add them to their portfolios.

Title: Don’t let AI steal your job

The bill will have major consequences for Americans. It’s our mission to ensure you can stay informed and understand how the bill will impact your life. If you believe in that mission, please support our journalism. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It’s okay to hate AI’s encroachment into work. Learn to use it anyway. A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes. ChatGPT’s most advanced models recently served me a surprising statistic: US productivity grew faster in 2024 than in any year since the 1960s. Half that jump can be linked to generative AI tools that most workers hadn’t even heard of two years earlier. The only problem is that it’s not true. The AI made it up. Despite its much-documented fallibility, generative AI has become a huge part of many people’s jobs, including my own. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but a June Gallup poll found that 42 percent of American employees are using AI a few times a year, while 19 percent report deploying it several times a week. The technology is especially popular with white-collar workers. While just 9 percent of manufacturing and front-line workers use AI on a regular basis, 27 percent of white-collar workers do. Even as many people integrate AI into their daily lives, it’s causing mass job anxiety: A February Pew survey found that more than half of US employees worried about their fate at work. Unfortunately, there is no magic trick to keep your job for the foreseeable future, especially if you’re a white-collar worker. Nobody knows what’s going to happen with AI, and leadership at many companies is responding to this uncertainty by firing workers it may or may not need in an AI-forward future. “If AI really is this era’s steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it.” After laying off over 6,000 workers in May and June, Microsoft is laying off 9,000 more workers this month, reportedly so the company can reduce the number of middle managers as it reorganizes itself around AI. In a note on Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that the company would “roll out more generative AI and agents” and reduce its workforce in the next few years. This was all after Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned AI would wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the same timespan, a prediction so grim that Axios coined a new term for AI’s imminent takeover: “a white-collar bloodbath.” This is particularly frustrating because, as my recent encounter with ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate makes clear, the generative AI of today, while useful for a growing number of people, needs humans to work well. So does agentic AI, the next era of this technology that involves AI agents using computers and performing tasks on your behalf rather than simply generating content. For now, AI is augmenting white-collar jobs, not automating them, although your company’s CEO is probably planning for the latter scenario. Maybe one day AI will fulfill its promise of getting rid of grunt work and creating endless abundance, but getting from here to there is a harrowing proposition. “With every other form of innovation, we ended up with more jobs in the end,” Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor and author of the newsletter One Useful Thing, told me. “But living through the Industrial Revolution still kind of sucked, right? There were still anarchists in the street and mass displacement from cities and towns.” We don’t know if the transition to the AI future will be quite as calamitous. What we do know is that just as jobs transformed due to past technological leaps, like the introduction of the personal computer or the internet, your day-to-day at work will change in the months and years to come. If AI really is this era’s steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it. At the same time, becoming an AI whiz will not necessarily save you if your company decides it’s time to go all in on AI and do mass, scattershot layoffs in order to give its shareholders the impression of some efficiency gains. If you’re impacted, that’s just bad luck. Still, having the skills can’t hurt. It’s okay to be scared of AI, but it’s more reasonable to be confused by it. For two years after ChatGPT’s explosive release, I couldn’t quite figure out how a chatbot could make my life better. After some urging from Mollick late last year, I forced myself to start using it for menial chores. Upgrading to more advanced models of ChatGPT and Claude turned these tools into indispensable research partners that I use every day — not just to do my job faster but also better. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.) But when it comes to generative AI tools and the burgeoning class of AI agents, what works for one person might not be helpful to the next. “Workers obviously need to try to ascertain as much as they can — the skills that are most flexible and most useful,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. “They need to be familiar with the technology because it is going to be pervasive.” For most white-collar workers, I recommend Mollick’s 10-hour rule: Spend 10 hours using AI for work and see what you learn. Mollick also recently published an updated guide to the latest AI tools that’s worth reading in full. The big takeaways are that the best of these tools (ChatGPT from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, and Google Gemini) can become tireless assistants with limitless knowledge that can save you hours of labor. You should try different models within the different AI tools, and you should experiment with the voice features, including the ability to use your phone’s camera to share what you’re seeing with the AI. You should also, unfortunately, shell out $20 a month to get access to the most advanced models. In Mollick’s words, “The free versions are demos, not tools.” “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that’s being done repetitively, that’s where the most risk comes in.” You can imagine similar advice coming from your geeky uncle at Thanksgiving circa 1984, when personal computers were on the brink of taking over the world. That was the year roughly the same percentage of white-collar workers were regularly using PCs at work as are using AI today. But the coming AI transition will look different than the PC transition we’ve already lived through. While earlier digital technologies hit frontline workers hardest, “AI excels at supporting or carrying out the highly cognitive, nonroutine tasks that better-educated, better-paid office workers do,” according to a February Brookings report co-authored by Muro. This means AI can do a lot of the tasks that software engineers, architects, lawyers, and journalists do, but it doesn’t mean that AI can do their jobs — a key distinction. This is why you hear more experts talking about AI augmentation rather than AI automation. As a journalist, I can confidently say that AI is great at streamlining my research process, saving me time, and sometimes even stirring up new ideas. AI is terrible at interviewing sources, although that might not always be the case. And clearly, it’s touch-and-go when it comes to writing factually accurate copy, which is kind of a fundamental part of the job. That proposition looks different for other kinds of white-collar work, namely administrative and operational support jobs. A Brookings report last year found that 100 percent of the tasks that bookkeepers and clerks do were likely to be automated. Those of travel agents, tax preparers, and administrative assistants were close to 100 percent. If AI really did make these workers redundant, it would add up to millions of jobs lost. “The thing I’d be most worried about is if my task and job are very similar to each other,” Mollick, the Wharton professor, explained. “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that’s being done repetitively, that’s where the most risk comes in.” It’s hard to AI-proof your job or career altogether given so much uncertainty. We don’t know if companies will take advantage of this transition in ways that produce better products and happier workers or just use it as an excuse to fire people, squandering what some believe is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform work and productivity. It sucks to feel like you have little agency in steering the future toward one outcome or the other. At the risk of sounding like your geeky uncle, I say give AI a try. The worst-case scenario is you spend 10 hours talking to an artificially intelligent chatbot rather than scrolling through Instagram or Reddit. The best-case scenario is you develop a new skill set, one that could very well set you up to do an entirely new kind of job, one that didn’t even exist before the AI era.

Title: Chinese tech firms gaining fast on Silicon Valley in AI race: report

China is fast encroaching on the US’ lead in the artificial intelligence race – raising concerns that Beijing could use the tech for strategic military advancements and the spread of disinformation, according to a report. Multinational banks, public universities and tech firms across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia have started to pivot to language learning models from Chinese firms like DeepSeek, according to a Wall Street Journal report. DeepSeek’s bot triggered a massive stock sell-off in the US earlier this year amid claims that it took less time and a fraction of the cost to develop compared to American counterparts. Global banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered have launched internal testing of the Chinese model, while Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, recently installed the bot in its main data center, according to the Journal. American tech giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google offer DeepSeek to customers – even as the Trump administration has banned the use of the Chinese model on government devices. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still the world’s most popular AI chatbot, with 910 million downloads worldwide compared to DeepSeek’s 125 million, according to researcher Sensor Tower. But Chinese bots are winning over users with much lower prices. And while US firms tend to focus on headline-worthy breakthroughs, China’s models are more consumer-friendly, according to the Journal. “The No. 1 factor that will define whether the U.S. or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said during a Senate hearing last month. “Whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant,” Smith warned. China is already exploring how it could exploit advances in AI for strategic military advances, according to papers published in military journals. If Beijing wins over the majority of users, its bots would serve as a powerful megaphone to cast out information reflecting its own view of the world. And, if China at some point stops cooperating with the US on safety and security measures, its unrestricted artificial intelligence could lead to unprecedented military and societal threats. Chinese firms have already succeeded despite several hurdles, including a harsh clampdown on US chip exports. Those trade roadblocks could also hurt American tech giants like Google, Meta and Nvidia, the latter of which is estimated to lose out on $10 billion in revenue without sales of its H20 AI chip to Beijing, according to researcher Jefferies. It’s a substantial change from just a few years back, when US investors in 2018 covered about 30% of $21.9 billion in funding for the Chinese AI sector, according to PitchBook. Every morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here! OpenAI has been focused on expanding its AI reach across Europe and Asia in order to preserve some industry dominance. “We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in May. China’s lower price tags could pressure US rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic to justify their own prices. “DeepSeek is overall the same quality but 17 times cheaper,” Oleg Zankov, co-founder of Latenode, which helps clients build custom AI tools, told the Journal. Many Chinese bots are also released as open-source models, meaning tweaks can be made, which has made them even more competitive. Developers have created more than 100,000 derivative models based on Alibaba’s flagship open-source model, according to Alibaba. And clients concerned about data security might also prefer open-source models that can be taken offline. Advertisement

Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. READ MORE: More Americans file for unemployment help but layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over tariffs The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. READ MORE: China says U.S. violating tariffs truce with moves on AI chips and student visas Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would’ve faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he’ll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he’d reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it’s close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There’s a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs’ costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. WACTH MORE: What’s ahead for U.S. economy as global market reacts to Trump’s tariffs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.

Title: Intel might axe the 18A process node for foundry customers, essentially leaving TSMC with no rival — Intel reportedly to focus on 14A

TSMC's N2 and A16 may have no rivals When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lip-Bu Tan, the chief executive of Intel, is considering stopping the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication technology (1.8nm-class) to foundry customers, instead shifting the company's efforts to its next-generation 14A manufacturing process (1.4nm-class) in a bid to secure orders from large customers like Apple or Nvidia, reports Reuters. If this shift in focus occurs, it would be the second node in a row that Intel has deprioritized. The proposed adjustment could result in major financial consequences and alter the trajectory of Intel's foundry operations, as it will effectively withdraw the company from the foundry market for several years. Intel informs us that the information is based on market speculation. However, the spokesperson provided some additional insight on the company's roadmap, which we've added further below.“We are not going to comment on market rumors and speculation," an Intel spokesperson said to Tom's Hardware. "As we have said previously, we are committed to strengthening our roadmap, delivering for our customers and improving our financial position for the future." After taking the helm in March, Lip-Bu Tan announced intentions to cut costs in April, which is expected to involve layoffs and the cancellation of certain projects. According to the new report, by June, he began sharing with colleagues that the 18A manufacturing process — a technology designed to showcase Intel's manufacturing prowess — was losing appeal to outside customers, which is why he believed it made sense for the company to shift away from offering 18A and its performance-enhanced 18A-P version to foundry customers. Instead, Lip-Bu Tan proposed directing more resources to the completion and promotion of 14A, the company's next-generation node, which will be ready for risk production in 2027 and for volume production in 2028. Given the timing of 14A, it is now time to start promoting it among potential third-party Intel Foundry clients. Intel's 18A fabrication technology is the company's first node to utilize its 2nd-generation RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, along with a PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN). By contrast, 14A utilizes RibbonFET 2 transistors, PowerDirect BSPDN, which delivers power directly to each transistor's source and drain through specialized contacts, and features Turbo Cells for critical paths. In addition, 18A is Intel's first leading-edge technology that is compatible with third-party design tools and can be used by its foundry customers. Dropping external sales of 18A and 18A-P would require Intel to account for a substantial write-off reflecting the billions it spent developing the manufacturing technologies, according to individuals familiar with internal deliberations cited by Reuters. Depending on how you count development costs, the resulting charge could total hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Both RibbonFET and PowerVia were initially developed for 20A, but that technology was cancelled for internal products last August in a bid to focus on 18A for both internal and external products. Intel's rationale behind the move may be rather simple. By limiting the number of potential customers for 18A, the company may potentially cut its operating costs. The majority of tools required for 20A, 18A, and 14A (except for High-NA EUV equipment) are already in place at its Fab D1D in Oregon, as well as at Fabs 52 and 62 in Arizona. However, once these tools are formally put into operation, the company will have to report their depreciation as a cost. Not putting them online potentially enables Intel to cut its costs amid uncertainties with orders from third-party clients. In addition, by not offering 18A and 18A-P to external customers, Intel may save money on engineers dedicated to supporting the sampling, ramp, and mass production of third-party circuits at Intel fabs. Obviously, this is speculation on our side. However, by ceasing to offer 18A and 18A-P to external clients, Intel will be unable to demonstrate advantages of its fabrication nodes to a broad range of customers with various designs, which would leave them with a single choice for next two or three years: go with TSMC and use N2, N2P, or even A16. Although Samsung is set to formally start making chips on its SF2 (also known as SF3P) node later this year, that node is expected to be behind Intel 18A and TSMC's N2 and A16 in terms of power, performance, and area. Essentially, Intel would not be showing up to its fight against TSMC's N2 and A16, which will certainly not help to gain the confidence of potential clients towards other Intel offerings, namely 14A, 3-T/3-E, Intel/UMC 12nm, and others. Reuters' sources familiar with the matter explained that Lip-Bu Tan had asked Intel's specialists to prepare proposals for discussion with Intel's board this fall. Options could include ceasing efforts to sign up new clients for 18A, though given the scale and complexity of the issue, the decision might not be finalized until the board meets again later this year. Intel itself reportedly declined to discuss hypothetical scenarios but confirmed that the main customer for 18A has always been its own Products division, which plans to begin producing codenamed Panther Lake CPUs for laptops in 2025 using this technology. Eventually, 18A and 18A-P will be adopted by Clearwater Forest, Diamond Rapids, and Jaguar Shores products. Intel's push to attract large-scale external clients to its Intel Foundry fabs remains critical to its turnaround, as only with high volumes the company will be able to pay off for its process technologies that cost billions to develop. However, in addition to Intel itself, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defence have formally confirmed plans to use 18A. While Broadcom and Nvidia are also reportedly testing Intel's latest process technology, they have yet to commit to using it for actual products. Intel's 18A has one key advantage over TSMC's N2: it features backside power delivery, which is particularly useful for power-hungry processors aimed at AI and HPC applications. TSMC's A16 with Super Power Rail (SPR) will only enter mass production in late 2026, so 18A will maintain the advantage of offering backside power delivery for Amazon, Microsoft, and potentially other customers for a while. However, N2 is expected to offer higher transistor density, which is beneficial for the vast majority of chip designs. Furthermore, while Intel has been running Panther Lake silicon at its D1D fab for quarters (so, currently Intel is still in risk production using 18A), the company's high-volume Fab 52 and Fab 62 started to run 18A test silicon this March, so they will start producing commercial chips only late in 2025, or rather in early 2025. Intel's external customers are, of course, interested in producing their designs at high-volume fabs in Arizona rather than at development fabs in Oregon. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly considering halting the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication process to external clients and instead focusing on the next-generation 14A production node, aiming to attract large customers such as Apple and Nvidia. The move could trigger massive write-offs, as Intel has spent billions developing 18A and 18A-P process technologies. Shifting focus to 14A could help cut costs and better prepare the node and operations for third-party clients, but the move risks undermining customer confidence in Intel's foundry capabilities ahead of 14A's planned production in 2027–2028. While the 18A node remains critical for Intel’s own products, such as Panther Lake CPUs, limited demand from third parties — so far, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense have confirmed plans to use it — has raised concerns about its viability. The potential decision — which will essentially withdraw Intel from the broad foundry market until 14A comes to market — will be reviewed by Intel's board later this year. Even if Intel eventually chooses to remove 18A from its foundry offerings, aimed at a broad range of applications and clients, the company will still manufacture chips using 18A for its own products, which are already designed for the process. It also intends to fulfill limited orders it has already committed to, including supplying chips for the aforementioned clients.

While items like stocks, real estate and bonds can often be relied upon for generating income, gold is typically considered a smart way to diversify your portfolio and hedge against inflation. Without the quick profit-earning potential that those other assets often provide, however, it's understandable that many have yet to turn to gold. But that could be a mistake, particularly now. With the need for a portfolio diversifier high, and both the protection against today's inflation and the next inevitable round pertinent, many would benefit from considering gold now. And physical gold, in the form of gold bars and coins, can be especially valuable for investors this July. Before diving into the gold market, however, it helps to better understand why gold, in this particular form, makes so much sense this month. Below, we'll detail three supporting reasons why it could be worth investing in now. Start protecting your portfolio with a reliable gold investment today. Here are three strong (and timely) reasons why a gold bar and coin investment makes sense this July: Stock market uncertainty earlier this year, combined with unpredictability surrounding the future of the economy, may understandably leave you uncomfortable investing in assets and items that you have little control over. But that's not a concern with gold bars and coins, as they offer you a tangible asset in an unpredictable economy. You can inspect your gold investment with precision, store it in the safety of your own home and otherwise enjoy the benefits that only a tangible asset like gold can offer. The only thing you'll need to monitor? The price of gold. And, fortunately for your investment, that looks to be only heading upward over time. Explore your gold bars and coins options here and get invested now. The days of jotting down a gold investing company phone number from an infomercial are long gone. Gold investing is ubiquitous now and, as such, gold bars and coins specifically are easy to buy, sell and buy more of. Whether you're using a top gold investing company or simply driving over to a big retailer like Costco or Walmart, you should have little issue buying a coin or bar right now. And you can do so online, as well, either on these retailer websites or by perusing the top gold companies doing business right now. The price of gold per ounce is $3,359.04 as of July 2. That's just under the record $3,400 gold hovered near earlier this year. And with predictions of gold hitting the $4,000 mark later in 2025, new investors may be wondering how they can break into the gold market for a reasonable price. Fortunately, physical gold offers this opportunity. By investing in fractional gold bars and coins, which weigh less than the traditional troy ounce, investors can secure the protection gold offers without having to overpay or shift resources from other assets at the same time. This allows investors to earn all of the same benefits that a gold investment in a larger size can provide while still keeping costs low and gold limited to a maximum 10% portfolio threshold. July 2025 could be the time to enter the physical gold market for investors who haven't yet got started. With the ability to offer investors a tangible asset in an uncertain economy, a simplicity in terms of buying and selling and an entry price point that can be tailored to your budget thanks to fractional gold amounts, gold bars and coins have multiple advantages this month. By taking advantage now, you may even be able to sell your gold for a quick profit later this fall, too, making it one of the overall better investment choices this summer.

Title: Microsoft to lay off around 9,000 workers in largest cuts since 2023 | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Microsoft is laying off thousands of employees, its third round of cuts in recent months, the company confirmed on Wednesday. The staff reduction will affect less than 4% of the company’s total workforce, or around 9,000 workers, according to a company spokesperson. It marks the tech giant’s largest layoffs since it cut 10,000 employees in 2023 and comes amid workforce cuts elsewhere in the tech industry. Microsoft’s stock was unchanged following the announcement. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company is reducing managerial layers and making employees more productive with new technologies. The staff reduction also comes as tech companies, including Microsoft, are using artificial intelligence to make their workforce more efficient. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that 20% to 30% of the company’s code was being generated by AI, and the company is pouring billions into AI infrastructure investments. Related article Microsoft to lay off 3% of workforce, report says It’s unclear whether AI directly contributed to Wednesday’s cuts and which Microsoft divisions will be affected. The Verge reported that Xbox leader Phil Spencer sent an internal note saying that his staff would be affected. Bloomberg also previously reported that the planned July layoffs would target the sales and Xbox teams. Wednesday’s cuts come after Microsoft laid off 3% of its staff, roughly 7,000 employees, in May. As of July 2024, the last time Microsoft formally reported its total headcount, the company employed 228,000 workers. Other tech companies have also conducted layoffs this year, including Meta and Bumble. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also warned his staff last month that AI would eventually help the company reduce headcount. Microsoft said in April that its quarterly profits had increased 18% to $25.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, on the back of strong performance for its cloud business and AI services. The company is expected to release earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter later this month. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Shares of Cyngn (CYN) took off Wednesday when the maker of self-driving industrial vehicles announced it raised enough cash in a shelf offering to cover its expenses through 2027. CEO Lior Tal wrote in a letter to shareholders that the company brought in $32 million last week. That's also when Cyngn made headlines by striking a collaboration agreement with Nvidia (NVDA). Tal added that the firm's DriveMod autonomous vehicles are "now operating in warehouse aisles and across factory floors around the clock, delivering measurable improvements to safety, productivity, and labor costs." Tal said that Cyngn machines have been deployed at several new sites across industries in recent months, including manufacturing, automotive, logistics, and consumer-packaged goods. Tal explained that to keep up with demand, Cyngn has moved into a new, larger headquarters office in Mountain View, Calif. Tal noted that the deal with Nvidia to use the chipmaker's Isaac robotics platform "has helped us move faster." Despite today's 12% advance, Cyngn shares are down nearly 90% in 2025. TradingView

Title: Microsoft is conducting another major round of layoffs

Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year. The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. That would be around 9,000 employees based on its head count of around 220,000 employees. Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. One affected employee said they have until July 8 to sign a severance agreement, after which they'll receive 60 days of paid leave. "We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient. A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales "solutions areas." BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes. The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers. Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its "span of control," or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven. It's not just Microsoft. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency. Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers. Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed "low performers."

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue.

Photo Credit: Reuters Microsoft had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024 Microsoft will lay off nearly 4% of its workforce, the company said on Wednesday, in the latest job cuts as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged $80 billion in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft said on Wednesday it planned to reduce organizational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on Wednesday. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5% of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit, and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across sectors in Corporate America, as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against further cost pressures. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: Arbitrum jumps 5% on Robinhood news – But THIS can ruin ARB’s breakout

Full Content:
Robinhood’s ARB adoption, $2.2M outflows, and a chart breakout—will ARB hit $0.50 next? Arbitrum [ARB] surprised the market with a clean 5% rally at press time, standing out while other major altcoins struggled for direction. The reason? Robinhood’s announcement. AMBCrypto had earlier reported that Robinhood would launch tokenized stocks, ETFs, and equities for EU users using Arbitrum’s Layer 2, alongside future plans to build a custom Orbit-based chain. Naturally, the market interpreted this as a massive ecosystem endorsement—bullish for ARB. At press time, Arbitrum traded around $0.342, notching a 4.88% gain in the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. While it led daily altcoin gainers, trading volume dropped nearly 30%, hinting at light participation behind the move. Despite lower participation from crypto investors, experts and analysts have shown strong interest in the token and appear to be making bold predictions. One expert emphasized that ARB is unlikely to miss its current level again, highlighting the asset’s strong upside potential. Meanwhile, another expert made a bold prediction, stating, “ARB is currently trading at $0.32 and showing strong momentum toward the $1 mark.” These are not the only posts that have surfaced on X; there are several other optimistic posts suggesting strong expert interest in the token and its upside potential. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, the ARB coin has been hovering within a descending channel pattern between the upper and lower boundaries since May 2025. With the recent price jump, the altcoin appeared to be heading toward the upper boundary of the channel. Source: TradingView If this rally holds, ARB could stretch another 7% to retest the channel top near $0.37. Furthermore, if this momentum continues and ARB breaks out of the channel, there is a strong possibility the altcoin could see a price surge of up to 34% in the near future. At press time, ARB was trading above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on a daily time frame, indicating a potential shift in trend and growing bullish momentum in the short term. Supporting this structure is the accumulation data from CoinGlass. In the last 48 hours, ARB saw $2.2 million in Exchange Outflows, including a $2.57 million daily net outflows on the 1st of July. Source: CoinGlass This shift typically signals investor confidence—whales moving coins off exchanges for cold storage or long-term holds.

ByJim Osman ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. 29 April 2025, USA, San Jose: Lip-Bu Tan, Chief Executive Officer of Intel, appears at an event ... More organized by the company. Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) Most investors chase headlines. I follow behavior. Today, Intel said more about the true state of its business—not in a press release, but in a quiet strategic walk-back that most will miss. Is Intel going for a breakup? Reuters reports that Intel’s new CEO is contemplating abandoning efforts to promote its highly anticipated 18A chip technology to external customers, despite having already invested billions in its development and promotion. On the surface, it’s a shift in product focus. But beneath this shift, it reveals a deeper behavioral insight. Intel envisioned its 18A chip node as the breakthrough technology that would spearhead its return to advanced chip manufacturing and secure foundry contracts from hyperscalers such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. Now? Intel is quietly shelving it. Instead, Intel will pivot external customers to its newer 14A process, effectively cutting its losses and leaning into a more focused narrative: fewer bets, better execution. At the same time, the company is shuttering its automotive chip division, laying off staff across its foundry unit, and simplifying decision-making inside the fabs. That’s not cost-cutting. That’s positioning. This action isn’t an isolated move; it’s a pattern. And patterns in corporate behavior often preceded structural change. To the average investor, the move looks like textbook discipline: cut a struggling initiative, refocus on core customers, and redeploy capital more efficiently. But for those of us who study special situations, spinoffs, and corporate behavior, it signals something deeper. This isn’t just strategy, it’s a reset in how Intel thinks. This isn’t just about a product pivot. It’s a behavioral inflection point—and the kind that often comes before structural change. Let’s be clear: Intel hasn’t announced a spinoff. There’s no Form 10, no S-1, and no public timeline to separate the foundry business—yet. But in my experience, corporate breakups don’t start with filings. They start with behavior. And right now, Intel is moving like a company preparing to split. Here’s what I’m watching: Breakup isn’t just about unlocking value. They’re about rebuilding trust. Intel isn’t there yet—but it’s signaling to investors: We’ve heard you. We’re cleaning the house. Stick with us. And for special situation investors, that’s a setup worth tracking closely. Intel remains a complex name. But this foundry pullback offers three critical insights for investors watching through a special situation’s lens: For now, the situation is not a trigger. But in my experience, the best setups don’t come labeled. You need to delve deeper into the details. After nearly two decades studying breakups, restructurings, and hidden value plays, one thing is clear: they rarely start with headlines. They start with quiet decisions, internal shifts, and changes in incentives, not narratives. Intel’s foundry pivot might not spark a re-rating tomorrow. But for investors who track structural change, this is the kind of move that matters. It’s not the event, it’s the signal. Flag it. Log it. Watch it. An Intel breakup may be coming.

Title: The battle for AI talent has been on an entirely different level

Good morning. One group of people may have to pay the price for Elon Musk reigniting his feud with Donald Trump: Tesla investors. The company's stock dropped 5% on Tuesday after Trump highlighted how much assistance Musk has gotten from the US government. Tesla investors will be on tenterhooks again this morning. The EV maker is expected to release its second-quarter vehicle delivery numbers in the coming hours. Wall Street seems braced for disaster. In today's big story, the hiring frenzy of the past few weeks for elite AI talent has been unprecedented, with Meta and OpenAI offering tens of millions of dollars to lure top workers. Plus, take a second and subscribe to BI's Defense Tech, a weekly recap of the latest innovations and strategies in modern warfare, defense tech, and more! What's on deck Markets: Why one PE firm wants to buy Red Hot Chili Peppers' entire catalog. Tech: Senate leaves Big Tech on the cutting room floor. Business: Paramount is paying $16 million to settle Trump's "60 Minutes" lawsuit. But first, need to land a prodigy? Try being prodigal. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Can you imagine getting paid more in a year than you had predicted you would ever make in your entire life? For top AI talent, this has been the reality of recent weeks. "I would describe them as in a state of shock," said Deedy Das, an AI investor at Menlo Ventures. He was talking about three of his friends who are machine-learning engineers or AI researchers — Das said they've all been offered between $8 and $20 million in total compensation a year to join Meta. "It's honestly hard to digest." Tech companies have long paid top dollar for elite talent, but the recent hiring frenzy has been on an entirely different level. And it seems AI talent can't start soon enough. "They're pressuring them to drop out of school," says Bill Aulet, a managing director at MIT. Comparisons have been drawn between the bidding war for AI talent and sports franchises competing for star athletes, with some on X suggesting that researchers hire agents to represent them. The first sign of this new, turbo-charged war for AI talent came when Meta recruited Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang last month as part of a $14.3 billion deal to take a 49% stake in his company. Then, Sam Altman said Meta had tried to poach his best employees with $100 million signing bonuses. (Meta executives recently pushed back, saying that the signing bonuses were not that generous.) This week, BI reported that Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, has paid some talent around half a million dollars in salary for her new startup before even announcing a first funding round or a product. So, what's driving the frenzy? Two factors: A shortage of talent and an excess of money. There is a limited number of researchers and engineers capable of building foundational models — something in the neighborhood of 2,000 people, BI's Bergman writes. Meanwhile, companies like Meta, which is approaching a market capitalization of $2 trillion, have the resources to spare no expense in order to avoid falling behind — and, as we've seen, they're not hesitant to do whatever it takes. 1. The PE giant dreaming of Californication. Bain Capital is in talks to re-enter the music industry and it's teaming up with Warner Music to do so. If it goes through, its first purchase will be the entire Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog for $300 million. Music has proven to be a defensive investment over the years amid economic and market turmoil. 2. Jerome Powell may have just escalated his beef with Trump. The Fed chair said on Tuesday that the president's tariff policy is to blame for the central bank's lack of rate cuts, and it remains in a wait-and-see position until the impact of tariffs becomes clearer. The president has hinted at replacing Powell, and here's what could happen if he follows through. 3. Three investing mistakes to avoid at a market high. Stocks are back near record highs after a tumultuous couple of months, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the second half of 2025. That said, don't fall for these common investing missteps when the market's up. 1. Big Tech has one less reason to like President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." Early Tuesday morning, senators voted 99-1 to strike a section in the bill aimed at preventing states from regulating AI. Tech leaders had argued that it was important not to hamper the AI industry at a time when competition with China is heating up. 2. What's going on between Microsoft and OpenAI? Both companies are currently renegotiating their multibillion-dollar partnership, which gives Microsoft access to OpenAI's technology. Precisely what OpenAI has to share — and when — is sometimes gray, people involved in the matter exclusively told BI's Ashley Stewart, and that's the central issue for Microsoft in these negotiations. 3. Threads finally gained one long-awaited feature. DMs have arrived on Meta's text-based social media network. The change was instituted after it became clear that users were interacting with a different crowd on Threads than on Instagram, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Paramount is paying $16 million to settle Trump's "60 Minutes" lawsuit. The suit, filed in October, alleged that an interview with Trump's presidential rival, Kamala Harris, had been selectively edited to "tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party" during November's election. Paramount emphasized that its statement did not include an apology or a statement of regret. Read more. 2. China's coffee giant is now brewing in America. Luckin Coffee opened two stores in Manhattan, offering a menu full of fruity specialties at extremely discounted prices. BI's reporter wasn't wowed but said it could take a bite out of Starbucks' sales. 3. RIP Bolt's unlimited PTO. The company's CEO Ryan Breslow announced it was eliminating its unlimited PTO policy and offering four mandatory paid weeks off instead. Breslow wrote on LinkedIn that when time off isn't defined "the good ones don't take PTO," and "the bad ones take too much." Tesla reports Q2 production and delivery figures.

Josh Boak Associated Press Published: July 2, 2025 at 6:26 AM Updated: July 2, 2025 at 11:56 AM Josh Boak Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved FILE - President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, May 23, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. Recommended Videos The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.

Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would’ve faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he’ll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he’d reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it’s close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There’s a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs’ costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.

Title: Analysis shows Trump’s tariffs would cost US employers $82.3 billion

By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries.

July 02, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The drone surveying market is expected to continue to sustain and continue to gain momentum due to increasing demand for aerial intelligence and high-precision mapping across major sectors such as agriculture, mining, construction, and environmental monitoring. A report from Fact.MR analysis indicates that the industry will be valued at USD 1.97 billion in 2025 and will grow to USD 11.49 billion by 2035, at a strong CAGR of 19.3% during the period. The report said: “Technological improvements in LiDAR, thermal imaging, and real-time stream of data over the past three years have dramatically improved safety and efficiency in drone surveying. Drones are increasingly being employed by governments and institutions for commercial use as they are safe, accurate, and cost-effective. Fact.MR believes that support from the authorities, especially in Europe and North America, is fueling commercial usage with better codes in the law. The increasing demand for high-precision geospatial intelligence is one of the key drivers of the adoption of drone surveying. Fact.MR research is of the view that the mining, agriculture, oil & gas, and infrastructure sectors increasingly depend on drones to maximize planning, minimize human risk, and digitize high-resolution terrain information with cost-efficient scalability across vast and inaccessible areas. The enormous digital revolution in the industrial sectors continues to accelerate demand. Combining drones with AI analytics, GIS platforms, and cloud systems enables real-time processing and decision-making. Fact. MR believes that the combination of drone technology with automation and IoT is revolutionizing conventional surveying processes into dynamic data-driven ecosystems.” Active Companies in the markets today include ZenaTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZENA), Ondas Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ONDS), Trimble Inc. (NASDAQ: TRMB), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Fact.MR continued: “The drone surveying industry is segmented by survey type into land survey, property survey, rail survey, and infrastructure survey. By end-use industry, it is categorized into energy, construction, transportation & warehouse, agriculture, mining, oil & gas extraction, public administration, and real estate & industrial plant. Regionally, the industry spans North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. IT concluded: “During the period 2025 to 2035, the infrastructure survey will be the most remunerative survey type segment, driven by the worldwide boom in urbanization, smart city programs, and projects for modernizing public infrastructure. Due to this increasing dependence and favorable regulatory changes across UAV use in civil infrastructure, the infrastructure survey segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.6% from 2025 to 2035, ahead of the industry average of 19.3%.” ZenaTech (NASDAQ:ZENA) Expands Drone as a Service (DaaS) to California with Offer to Acquire an Engineering and Surveying Firm, Tapping into Precision Agriculture and Viticulture Market - ZenaTech, Inc.

July 02, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Thanks to TikTok and other social media apps, finding “dupes” of high-end products is easier than ever. Now, Lululemon is taking Costco to court over the issue. The popular athletic wear brand sued the retailer for selling products that allegedly rip off some of its most popular items at a cheaper price point. Dozens of brands have sued over dupes, but it’s not just about proving a product was copied: The creators must show that a copycat product could confuse customers into thinking they’re buying the real thing. Still, many shoppers are intentionally seeking out fake products, one trademark lawyer told Forbes, which makes it much harder to prove brand confusion. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) speaks to reporters off the Senate floor after the Senate passes President Donald Trump's so-called "One, Big, Beautiful Bill," Act at the U.S. Capitol Building. After a marathon negotiation session to convince GOP holdouts, the Senate advanced President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. There are several key additions and omissions from earlier versions, including a softening on credits for wind and solar projects as well as more rural hospital funds. House leadership said it will vote on the Senate version Wednesday. In passing the bill, the Senate approved more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years and changes to federally funded health insurance programs that would leave nearly 12 million people without coverage, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans defending the cuts say they are aimed at reducing abuse, waste and fraud, as most of the Medicaid cuts come via new work requirements for some recipients. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk outside the White House in March. After President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparred again over his signature spending bill, Musk’s net worth plunged by $9.5 billion on the company’s more than 5% stock decline. Tesla shares are down 13% since the end of May, just before Musk and Trump’s public feud began. Musk remains the world’s richest man, but saw the biggest daily loss of any billionaire tracked by Forbes Tuesday. MORE: Tesla is expected to report a major drop in electric vehicle sales today, and Musk’s meltdown over the legislation raises the possibility that the intemperate billionaire is once again courting new risks for his companies, which have received at least $30 billion in federal support since 2010. Typically bullish on Tesla, analyst Dan Ives called it a “soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla’s stock.” EQT, Europe’s largest buyout fund, is shaking up its venture arm amid plans to increase investments in American startups. The $315 billion asset manager promoted investor Carolina Brochado to head up venture and growth investments from a new outpost in New York and announced the departure of four partners. Just months after slashing funding for U.S.-funded international broadcaster Voice of America, President Donald Trump’s media company is testing a global rollout of its streaming platform, raising conflict-of-interest concerns. Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group said the beta test of its streaming platform, Truth+, aims to expand beyond North America. Paramount's settlement will be paid directly to Trump's future presidential library. Paramount says it has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed over a 60 Minutes interview aired last year of former Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump alleged was edited to make the Democratic candidate appear more competent. As part of the settlement, Paramount said that 60 Minutes will release transcripts of all interviews with presidential candidates moving forward. Charlie Riedel/AP File President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—assuming the version Senate Republicans passed on Tuesday becomes law—would cut the legs out from under the renewable energy industry. The biggest hit: The bill would phase out federal tax credits that have for years enabled wind and solar developers to offset 30% or more of project costs. Ironically, these impacts will hit especially hard in Republican areas: 78% of renewable energy projects underway are located in Red districts. Co-CEOs Collin Roche (left) and Dean Mihas (right) are leading the second generation in charge of 45-year-old private equity firm GTCR. While private equity managers hoping for a dealmaking bonanza under President Donald Trump’s administration have been sorely disappointed, GTCR has bucked the trend with a series of gaudy exits. The Chicago-based firm’s $45 billion in assets under management pale in comparison to Wall Street’s biggest players like Blackstone, Apollo and KKR, but none of its peers made off with a deal like GTCR’s and FIS’ sale of Worldpay to Global Payments for $24.25 billion, announced in April and expected to close in the first half of 2026. GTCR bought a 55% stake in the Cincinnati-based payment processing firm from FIS at an $18.5 billion valuation in July 2023, and flipped it in less than two years for double the equity it invested. This comes during a time when the average holding period for the private equity industry crept up to more than six years in 2023 and 2024, a signal that many firms are struggling to find buyers for their businesses. And since the Worldpay deal, GTCR announced two more smaller sales in May, offloading lab equipment firm Antylia Scientific and insurance software business Itel for more than $1 billion each. The flurry of activity means GTCR is expected to return a reported $5 billion in proceeds to investors this year, building on a strong track record for its recent flagship funds. WHY IT MATTERS “It was a slow first half of the year for private equity, but there are always going to be winners and losers on Wall Street, and GTCR is one under-the-radar firm that seized the spotlight,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Its success could make pension funds and endowments hopeful that a rebound is coming for the buyout firms in their portfolios, even while rumors are circulating that some institutions are trying to sell stakes of their private equity investments at discounted prices.” MORE These 7 European And Asian Stocks Are Crushing It And Still Cheap As political divisions in the U.S. continue to grow, a majority of Americans believe politically motivated violence is now a major problem, a new poll shows: 76%: The share of Americans who believe the issues dividing the nation pose a serious threat to democracy, according to the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll 25: The number of attacks and plots targeting elected officials, candidates and other government employees from 2016 to 2025, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies Three times: The number of politically motivated attacks and plots against government agents in just the past five years is three times higher than those in the previous 25 years combined Underperforming the market can cost thousands of dollars of gains in just a few years—so be sure to avoid some of these common mistakes. Don’t try to time the market, and invest consistently each month. Don’t put all of your investments into one stock or sector, and if you do pick individual stocks, take the time to research them. Lastly, build an emergency fund before you start investing so you don’t have to dip into your investments during market downturns.

Title: How large are large language models? (2025)
URL: https://gist.github.com/rain-1/cf0419958250d15893d8873682492c3e
Time Published: 2025-07-02T10:39:38Z
Full Content:
Instantly share code, notes, and snippets. This aims to be factual information about the size of large language models. None of this document was written by AI. I do not include any information from leaks or rumors. The focus of this document is on base models (the raw text continuation engines, not 'helpful chatbot/assistants'). This is a view from a few years ago to today of one very tiny fraction of the larger LLM story that's happening. *Llama 7B, 13B, 33B, 65B: The 65B model was pretrained on a 1.4T (trillion tokens) dataset. LLaMA was officially stated to use Books3 source as a data set - this is a very important dataset which has been pivotal in lawmaking regarding the training of AIs on large amounts of copyrighted and potentially pirated material. Llama-3.1 405B (2024): The 405B llama model was released. This is a dense transformer model, meaning all parameters are used in inference passes. Initial pretraining: 2.87T tokens, long context: 800B, annealing: 40M - so 3.67T total. source: The Llama 3 Herd of Models. By this point meta has learned to say less about what data goes into the models "We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge" - so I can't say as much about what goes into the training data here. Empirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks The emerging trend of annealing pretrained models to 'benchmax' is unfortunate in that it biases the base language models somewhat away from being pure text continuation engines. This should really be part of the post-training which aims to make the models role play as some kind of AI-chatbot helpful assistant character. But these companies care very much about metrics and scores. For a long time, there weren't really any large language models available to download. There was certainly nothing comparable with GPT-3 for a few years. There were projects to try to match it, but generally they operated by fine tuning things like small (70B) llama models on a bunch of GPT-3 generated texts (synthetic data - which can result in degeneration when AI outputs are fed back into AI training intputs). The release of 405B was a turning point here. Just before that (Dec 2023) Mistral released Mixtral 8x7B - a MoE model, and then in April 2024 Mixtral-8x22B was released - a 141B total, A39B sparse MoE model. Even though this was not a dense model, like GPT-3 (175B) it is comparable in total parameter size. The MoE arch. enabled larger models to be trained and used by more people - people without access to thousands of interconnected GPUs. This was released the day after Christmas 2024. In the words of the deepseek webpage: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base paper. This was a gigantic leap forward in model size, and when R1 (the reasoning model built on top of this base model) was released it impressed a lot of people, I think this may have been the first time a truly GPT-4 level model was available to download and use. For reasons unclear this temporarily tanked the NVDA stock price. This really opened the door to new large MoE language models being trained, especially in China, and released freely for people to use. Note the following models are also starting to be multi-modal, as well as multi-linguial, so they have been provided large amounts of new types of data during training. Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts. DBRX has 16 experts and chooses 4, while Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1 have 8 experts and choose 2. https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/models#repos https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Text-01 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08313 456B A45.9B Attention, Softmax Attention and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Building upon the architecture design and computation optimizations, we train our foundational language model, MiniMax-Text-01 To assess document quality at a granular level, we utilize our previous-generation model as the reward labeler (a MoE model with 5B activations and 60B total parameters). dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-72B after pretrained on high-quality corpus without synthetic data Architecture: Multi-head Attention with QK-Norm in attention Layer, fine-grained MoE utilizing top-6 out of 128 routed experts, plus 2 shared experts. During the training stage, the shared expert remains perpetually active, while only 8 non-shared experts are activated simultaneously. It is not clear to me how many tokens the base model here was trained on but the hf page says "trillions". For a long time there were very very few LLMs on the same scale as GPT-3 that are available. Attempts to match GPT-3 level performance with downloadable weights were hindered by this, and genuinely, I do not think people understood that the raw size of the model being comparable to 175B was required. All that was available were the <=70B llama models and people tried to work with them. 405B is the latest large dense base model available that I'm aware of, but it's annealed and contains recent data in its pretraining (meaning that there will be people discussing LLMs and sharing logs and transcripts of LLMs), so it's a little bit more like an 'assistant' than previous base models. The same flaws apply to the recent wave of MoE models. They also have some aspets of Chinese culture baked into them. It's not completely clear how to compare MoE models with dense models. Perhaps there are aspects of LLM-intelligence that can only be achieved with sufficient depth/density. I don't think the current automated benchmarks are able to capture this, so everyone is just going all in on MoEs now. Newer models might be trained with new architectures (RWKV, byte-latent, bitnet), or new techniques of synthetic data generation (to avoid lawsuits, and to get good scores on benchmarks), but it's unclear how important these things really are for making a good raw text continuation engine - which I believe is the foundation for the capabilities that whatever type of fine-tuning elicits from these neural networks. Currently the trend is to make chatbots that roleplay as 'ai assistants' - and I really hope that more people investigate alternatives. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

Who is John? Arnold Ventures “Our philanthropic intent is to give away the vast majority of our money during our lifetime.” An entrepreneur from a young age “I ended up spending a couple summers just full time on this baseball card, really geographic arbitrage and information arbitrage, that I would have a sense of who the best buyer was for every product.” Defining arbitrage— What he wanted to do after college “I was the guy that was trying to get out of there and into the game as quickly as possible. Every day I was at college, it was one less day that I had to be in the game.” What that meant to the industry: In 1995, there were 2 aspects to Enron’s business: 1 – The historical pipeline business 2 – A new “investment bank” side John first job at Enron “I found the perfect job for my skill set as my first job. And I think that’s pretty rare, and it happened by accident. I could have very easily ended up a mergers and acquisition investment banker at Merrill Lynch, but I ended up trading commodities at a relative upstart of a company that was just the perfect spot for my skill set.” How John rose so quickly through Enron Winter of 1996—“A whole new game” “I think it ended up being the downfall of the company as well, as there just wasn’t the controls on people who were given too much responsibility, too much of the company’s balance sheet to use without their adequate controls on it.” “The stress level was intense. I think I’m very good at handling stress, but the stress level was intense to a point of not being healthy.” How do many traders destress? Did John experience an “addiction” to the “high” of trading? What made John such an exceptional trader? Regarding emotional detachment— ⇒ There’s a saying in the investment world, “Fear and greed drives a lot of price trends in financial assets.” The confidence spectrum— How did these traits translate into John’s philanthropy work? “Everything we’re doing in the foundation is evidence-based, but the evidence is never perfect.” Book about the fall of Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room Preceding Enron’s collapse… Bad decisions— When did John realize his career at Enron was going to be cut short? When John was still at Enron… How John grew Centaurus so successfully The synergy of market arbitrage plus speculative trading: The two strands of John’s hedge fund— 1) Providing liquidity and getting paid for the service of warehousing some risks, and 2) Speculative trading – Trying to make a call on where natural gas prices were going next The moment John realized he’d never have to worry about money again: When did John first start thinking about philanthropy? “I always recognized the limited social value of trading. I think there is a need for someone to provide risk warehousing and liquidity to markets, but trying to tell the story about how I was adding value or contributing to society was hard. And that always bothered me.” When John’s hedge fund started gaining major attention: John business was all about return (not fees from investors)— Background After 2005, two things happened in the industry— Amaranth’s position in 2006— So what happened in 2006? How John thought about the situation: John has a “third superpower”—an insatiable, bordering on pathological, obsession for knowing everything In his trading days… How did John make up for this informational disadvantage? “Our advantage was that we’re going to invest in the fundamentals more than anybody else is and then overlay that with some good trading.” 3 main reasons why trading natural gas was “easier” than oil: 1) It was this closed system —the molecules, for the most part, just stayed in North America 2) Deregulation got the pipelines out of the business of trading 3) Twice a year, there was a mechanism to get you back close to fair value Deciding to focus on philanthropy “I started thinking more about giving the money away than making more of it. That was really the signal to me that I want to be spending my time on the other side of the table and I’m physically and mentally, emotionally exhausted with trading natural gas.” A hard decision “When you’ve been playing in Vegas with the $25 table to go back down to the $5 table. It’s just not as emotionally interesting.” Summary of factors leading to the shutdown of his hedge fund— “These things came together and it still took me two years to make that call, that it’s time, it’s time to close this up and go find happiness somewhere else.” Skills in trading that translated to philanthropy: 1-Emotional temperament—not letting your feelings get in the way of what you’re doing 2-Having the right amount of confidence 3-An ability to become an expert in something in a relatively short period of time K-12 education — the first problem the foundation looked at deeply The questions John had about K-12 education: “[K-12] is just the most fundamental issue facing long-term health and viability of this country.” The theory of change that drives John’s work in K-12: The theory: Strong and robust systems of any kind have the attributes of biological evolution In public education— Arnold Foundation’s theory is that… If this theory works… What’s the role of philanthropy? Role for “strategic” philanthropy How challenging is doing this kind of strategic philanthropy? Example, the topic like preschool: In every area that John has researched, he finds the same thing— *One main insight from doing the deep digging: The question for the foundation became: What’s our role? Where could our dollars be most helpful? John’s frustration with trying to find the “right program” to fund really led him and the foundation down the path of—How do you change and improve the system and the incentives and the rules of a system rather than what’s the next program we can fund? When the criminal justice system got on John’s radar: “There is this natural impatience. But I think we’ve been smart enough to realize that it’s smarter to invest wisely tomorrow than do something that’s unlikely to have an impact today.” How criminal justice system is broken: John’s take on how we got to the current state of the criminal just system: Fast forward to today— Speculating on what accounted for the reduction is crime starting in the mid-90s What other factors could have accounted for the reduction in crime if not the increase in incarceration? Of all the mechanisms or tactics that would lead to an increase in incarceration, which of those were perhaps the most responsible for mass incarceration? How do we solve this problem? Is the role for philanthropy to try to address the questions of racism within law enforcement? For a long time, the focus has been on reducing crime rates with no regard for the secondary effects that the criminal justice system causes on these communities and families A big dilemma: Minority communities have felt both over-policed and under policed at the same time. Addressing the problem: Peter’s take on the prison system: John’s response: “The nature of prisons has to change. If you wait until the days someone’s released, that’s way too late.” The foundation’s work on re-imagining prisons The ROI case The values case How is John thinking about health policy in America? So where is John trying to apply his resources? The first area John wants to address is drug prices because it’s a topic with: The foundation is focused on creating a more rational system to price pharmaceuticals that— The political window: For politicians to consider health care policies— Peter’s rant on the US health care: ⇒ For more on the health care system and issues with drugs, see Peter’s interviews with Marty Makary and Katherine Eban Enormous health care spending—how can we change this? Without the greatest sovereign default on debt, what is it going to take to change this? The severe consequences of inflation “I want to help the world, I want to solve problems, but if the answer is just shovel more money at it, that’s not a sustainable answer in my mind.” John’s foundation is working on: How do we improve the system without spending more money? Optimistic about the future — Change happens slowly, then very quickly “You just don’t have that feedback mechanism in this work that you had in the [natural gas] market and the complete opposite end of the spectrum” John’s high level thoughts on climate change How will John’s foundation work on climate change? Where John thinks they can add value: Regarding his own kids— “Whenever you have that checkbook, people look at you differently, and treat you differently. . .because there is always something that they want funded. . .If somebody’s growing up in their teens and their 20s, and is looked at by the rest of the world as a checkbook first, I think that’s a very damaging way to grow up.” Advice to young adults with an interest in philanthropy: The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Benchmark Index Ticks Lower After Two Days of Record Highs
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/s-and-p-500-gains-and-losses-today-07012025-11764421

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the first trading day of the third quarter as the Senate narrowly passed a major tax and spending bill that includes significant tax cuts, reductions in health care and food assistance programs, and increases in national security spending. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, failing to build on a two-session stint of record-high closes. Underperformance from the communication and technology sectors pressured the Nasdaq, which fell 0.8%, while the Dow gained 0.9%. Shares of natural gas processing and transport firm The Williams Companies (WMB) dropped 6.5%, falling the most of any stock in the S&P 500. The downturn comes after the energy infrastructure company announced a shakeup in its executive suite, with Chad Zamarin, currently an executive vice president, stepping up as the new president and CEO, and chief executive Alan Armstrong transitioning to a new role as executive chairman of the board of directors. Axon Enterprise (AXON) shares declined 6.4% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Although the maker of the Taser and other law enforcement equipment posted strong year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, the company is navigating cost pressure, with selling, general, and administrative costs also up significantly from a year ago. Tesla (TSLA) stock lost 5.3% as tensions resurfaced between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The president accused Musk of reaping excessive benefits from electric vehicle subsidies, suggesting that the Department of Government Efficiency, formerly led by Musk, should review programs that have subsidized Musk's business ventures, which include rocket company SpaceX as well as Tesla. Shares of casino and resort operators pushed higher after regulators in Asian gambling hotspot Macau reported a year-over-year surge in gaming revenue in June. Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) both surged around 8.9%, notching the best performances in the S&P 500. MGM Resorts International (MGM) shares were up 7.3%. All three companies have significant exposure to Macau. The National Association of Realtors pointed to several provisions in the Senate's tax and spending bill that could be positive for the housing market, including an extension of the mortgage interest deduction and lower individual tax rates. Meanwhile, mortgage rates remain near their lowest levels in several months, reflecting optimism that the Fed could be on its way to resuming interest-rate cuts. Shares of Builders FirstSource (BLDR), the largest U.S. supplier of residential construction materials, jumped 8.8%. Packaging Corporation of America (PKG) shares were up 7.6% after the company announced an agreement to buy the containerboard business of the industrial packaging firm Greif for $1.8 billion. The deal includes two containerboard mills, located in Ohio and Virginia, with an annual production capacity of approximately 800,000 tons. Packaging Corporation said it expects synergies stemming from improvements in operational and production efficiency, mill grade optimization, and reduced transport costs.

The feature from tokenization firm Backed, rolled out on centralized exchanges Kraken and Bybit this week in certain regions and also launched natively on the Solana blockchain, allows traders to gain exposure to popular American equities like Meta, Netflix, Coinbase, McDonald’s, and more on-chain. In other words, eligible users can swap crypto or fiat for stocks on the aforementioned exchanges, or swap any Solana token for the xStock of their choosing via decentralized protocols like Jupiter or Raydium. still can't believe you can now swap between fartcoin and USA stocks, permissionlessly, across the globe with just an internet connection and a solana wallet internet capital markets pic.twitter.com/8Mmyy47dnz — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) June 30, 2025 While tokenized stocks, or the process of putting shares of companies on-chain, is not a new idea, xStocks differs from previous implementations that simply reflected the price of an off-chain asset with a “mirrored” asset on-chain. Instead, each xStock token is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset which is held by a regulated third-party. In other words, a user that purchases a share of Apple on-chain via xStocks is assured that their single share of Apple is held in custody and redeemable at any time. “For the first time, people all over the world can own and use a share of a tokenized stock like they would use money. You can move it, hold it, spend it, or borrow against it. All from your wallet, with no intermediaries, no borders and no delays,” said Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement about the platform’s xStock launch. According to Backed, trading tokenized stocks like xStocks offers a handful of benefits that users trading via a traditional brokerage would not get. For example, xStocks allows users to trade 24/7, while a brokerage is subject to the stock market’s hours. Additionally, their use on global blockchains allows participants in other geographies to gain exposure to the American stock market, and for trades to take place without broker commissions. It also makes equities available for use in decentralized finance (DeFi). While Kraken and Bybit have tapped Backed and its xStocks product for its tokenized equities, other platforms are looking to build their own tokenized product suites. Coinbase has been seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform, with its Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal calling that approval a “huge priority” in June. Furthermore, Robinhood announced Monday that it is rolling out tokenized stock trading to its European users, allowing them to trade U.S.-listed stocks via Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. The firm also plans to launch its own dedicated layer-2 blockchain powered by Arbitrum, and migrate the service to that chain.

The feature from tokenization firm Backed, rolled out on centralized exchanges Kraken and Bybit this week in certain regions and also launched natively on the Solana blockchain, allows traders to gain exposure to popular American equities like Meta, Netflix, Coinbase, McDonald’s, and more on-chain. In other words, eligible users can swap crypto or fiat for stocks on the aforementioned exchanges, or swap any Solana token for the xStock of their choosing via decentralized protocols like Jupiter or Raydium. still can't believe you can now swap between fartcoin and USA stocks, permissionlessly, across the globe with just an internet connection and a solana wallet internet capital markets pic.twitter.com/8Mmyy47dnz — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) June 30, 2025 While tokenized stocks, or the process of putting shares of companies on-chain, is not a new idea, xStocks differs from previous implementations that simply reflected the price of an off-chain asset with a “mirrored” asset on-chain. Instead, each xStock token is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset which is held by a regulated third-party. In other words, a user that purchases a share of Apple on-chain via xStocks is assured that their single share of Apple is held in custody and redeemable at any time. “For the first time, people all over the world can own and use a share of a tokenized stock like they would use money. You can move it, hold it, spend it, or borrow against it. All from your wallet, with no intermediaries, no borders and no delays,” said Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement about the platform’s xStock launch. According to Backed, trading tokenized stocks like xStocks offers a handful of benefits that users trading via a traditional brokerage would not get. For example, xStocks allows users to trade 24/7, while a brokerage is subject to the stock market’s hours. Additionally, their use on global blockchains allows participants in other geographies to gain exposure to the American stock market, and for trades to take place without broker commissions. It also makes equities available for use in decentralized finance (DeFi). While Kraken and Bybit have tapped Backed and its xStocks product for its tokenized equities, other platforms are looking to build their own tokenized product suites. Coinbase has been seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform, with its Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal calling that approval a “huge priority” in June. Furthermore, Robinhood announced Monday that it is rolling out tokenized stock trading to its European users, allowing them to trade U.S.-listed stocks via Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. The firm also plans to launch its own dedicated layer-2 blockchain powered by Arbitrum, and migrate the service to that chain.

Bitcoin slid on Tuesday as weakness in U.S. tech stocks appeared to spill over into crypto markets. The crypto asset fell about 1% over the past 24 hours, trading at $106,175 at press time as traders took profits after ending June above the $107,000 for its highest-ever monthly close. Sentiment equally soured in equities with shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) both taking heavy losses, dragging the Nasdaq lower by about 0.6% — a pattern that often weighs on digital assets. Tesla was lower by 5.4% in afternoon trade after the Donald Trump/Elon Musk spat re-erupted alongside the momentum for passage of the GOP's spending bill. Major altcoins including Solana SOL$147.40, Cardano ADA$0.5778 and Avalanche AVAX$17.83 posted steep declines, adding to a broader downturn across the crypto space. SOL led the way with a 6% decline following yesterday's spike higher on news of imminent launch of an ETF. Speaking in Europe at an ECB event, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell repeated recent comments about the U.S. economy being in a good spot, thus allowing for patience as the central bank mulls the idea of rate cuts. Powell's comments Tuesday were of particular import given what's now a clear split between him and at least two other Fed members, both of whom would like to see a July rate cut on the table. Powell did allow that a rate cut this month isn't off the table, but gave little indication he's considering easing policy in July. Thanks to the July 4 holiday, the government's employment report for June will be released on Thursday this week. Economists are expecting jobs to have grown by 110,000 in June versus 139,000 the previous month. A sizable delta below that 110,000 level could quickly change sentiment about the Fed's July decision.

July 01, 2025 13:53 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Ripple CTO Drops Bombshell On Pre-IPO Shares As Linqto Meltdown Explodes
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-bombshell-pre-ipo-shares-linqto/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T17:30:03Z
Full Content:
Linqto’s once-celebrated promise to “democratize” (Ripple) pre-IPO investing is collapsing under the weight of federal probes, a looming bankruptcy filing and a furious customer base that now numbers roughly 13,000. According to an internal review first detailed by The Wall Street Journal, investigators for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice are examining allegations that former chief executive William Sarris secretly marked up Ripple shares by more than 60 percent, sold customer stock without permission and promoted deals to thousands of investors who failed to meet accredited-investor standards. New management concedes that client accounts have been frozen since February and warns that a Chapter 11 filing could leave many investors as unsecured creditors. A March 14 press release from the company’s new leadership confirmed “pervasive securities-law violations,” the pausing of all trading and the dismissal of nearly half the staff while Linqto “explores all options to preserve value,” including court-supervised restructuring. The same statement insists that the special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) holding customers’ assets remain on issuer cap tables, but concedes that an independent forensic review is under way to verify that claim. Into that vacuum stepped attorney John E. Deaton, who told his X followers that the situation is a “total clusterfuck” and that roughly 11,500 Linqto users bought units in SPVs that, in turn, were supposed to own Ripple shares. Deaton says as many as 5,000 of those investors are non-accredited, creating “a regulatory compliance nightmare” now squarely on the SEC’s radar. He plans to host a live session at 3 p.m. EST today to detail what he calls a “heavily involved” enforcement action and to explain why simply refunding principal would strip investors of six- and seven-figure gains booked on private-share price appreciation. Ripple’s chief technology officer David Schwartz—better known online as “JoelKatz”—added fuel to the blaze by reminding holders that they never owned Ripple equity outright. “You don’t own the shares directly,” Schwartz wrote, “but you own a portion of a legal entity that owns the shares.” He elaborated, saying: “So if you ‘bought’ Z shares, you own X fraction of a legal entity with Y shares where X×Y=100. This generally lets you buy ‘shares’ more easily and in smaller quantities, but the equivalent per-share price is usually higher.” This clarification dismantled a key misconception among many Linqto clients who believed they were holding Ripple stock directly. The implications are now being examined not only by the SEC but also by customers who fear their indirect ownership could be rendered illiquid or encumbered in bankruptcy court. When pressed about whether those SPVs could be affected by Linqto’s financial collapse, Schwartz responded: “The legal entity that owns the shares that you own part of should not have exposure to Linqto going bankrupt. So a direct encumbrance on the shares to cover Linqto’s debts shouldn’t happen. But the entity may face operational challenges depending on exactly how it’s structured.” That operational risk is precisely what has many investors on edge. If trustees, custodians, or record-keepers tied to those SPVs are forced to restructure, change providers, or liquidate assets, investors may find themselves in prolonged legal limbo with no access to their holdings—even if the shares remain technically intact on the cap table. Complicating perceptions further, Schwartz addressed a separate thread linking billionaire George Soros to Ripple. He clarified that Soros Fund Management backed PolySign—another private company in which many Linqto users invested—during its 2022 acquisition of fund administrator MG Stover, but said he was “not aware of any Soros connection to Ripple.” Initially, Schwartz wrote: “It wouldn’t surprise me very much since his funds own bits of almost everything (Salesforce, Amazon, Google, JP Morgan, Goldman, Uber, FedEx, and many more), but I couldn’t find any actual connection.” However, after further reflection, he corrected himself: “Oh, wait, I remember now. Yes, Soros’ fund did invest in PolySign to help finance the acquisition of MG Stover! No connection to Ripple AFAICT though.” The deeper regulatory concern is structural. Linqto created more than 500 SPVs, each designed to pool hundreds of retail investors while keeping the underlying issuer’s shareholder count below the 2,000-owner threshold that triggers public-reporting obligations. Internal emails obtained by investigators show former executives exhorting staff to “take no prisoners” in sales campaigns—at times buying back Ripple shares from customers at $55 each, only to flip them to Ripple for $61, banking an $8 million spread. If those shares never made it into the SPVs—as suggested in confidential memos cited by investigators—questions of beneficial ownership, tax liability and voting rights could embroil Ripple itself in discovery. What happens next will hinge on three converging clocks: Linqto’s restructuring timetable, the SEC’s enforcement calendar and the pace at which SPV trustees can—or cannot—demonstrate clean title to almost half a billion dollars’ worth of private-company shares. Until then, thousands of would-be Ripple shareholders remain locked out of their accounts, watching from the sidelines as a legal and regulatory cyclone decides whether their “pre-IPO dream” survives or is wiped out in a courtroom ledger.

Title: UN report lists companies complicit in Israel’s ‘genocide’: Who are they?
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/1/un-report-lists-companies-complicit-in-israels-genocide-who-are-they
Time Published: 2025-07-01T17:20:39Z
Full Content:
UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese has issued a report naming several US giants among companies aiding Israel’s occupation and war on Gaza. Companies from other countries – from China to Mexico – are also named. The United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) has released a new report mapping the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians and its genocidal war on Gaza, in breach of international law. Francesca Albanese’s latest report, which is scheduled to be presented at a news conference in Geneva on Thursday, names 48 corporate actors, including United States tech giants Microsoft, Alphabet Inc. – Google’s parent company – and Amazon. A database of more than 1000 corporate entities was also put together as part of the investigation. “[Israel’s] forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely,” the report said. “Companies are no longer merely implicated in occupation – they may be embedded in an economy of genocide,” it said, in a reference to Israel’s ongoing assault on the Gaza Strip. In an expert opinion last year, Albanese said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe Israel was committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave. The report stated that its findings illustrate “why Israel’s genocide continues”. “Because it is lucrative for many,” it said. Israel’s procurement of F-35 fighter jets is part of the world’s largest arms procurement programme, relying on at least 1,600 companies across eight nations. It is led by US-based Lockheed Martin, but F-35 components are constructed globally. Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A is listed as a main contributor in the military sector, while Japan’s FANUC Corporation provides robotic machinery for weapons production lines. The tech sector, meanwhile, has enabled the collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, “supporting Israel’s discriminatory permit regime”, the report said. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon grant Israel “virtually government-wide access to their cloud and AI technologies”, enhancing its data processing and surveillance capacities. The US tech company IBM has also been responsible for training military and intelligence personnel, as well as managing the central database of Israel’s Population, Immigration and Borders Authority (PIBA) that stores the biometric data of Palestinians, the report said. It found US software platform Palantir Technologies expanded its support to the Israeli military since the start of the war on Gaza in October 2023. The report said there were “reasonable grounds” to believe the company provided automatic predictive policing technology used for automated decision-making in the battlefield, to process data and generate lists of targets including through artificial intelligence systems like “Lavender”, “Gospel” and “Where’s Daddy?” The report also lists several companies developing civilian technologies that serve as “dual-use tools” for Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. These include Caterpillar, Leonardo-owned Rada Electronic Industries, South Korea’s HD Hyundai and Sweden’s Volvo Group, which provide heavy machinery for home demolitions and the development of illegal settlements in the West Bank. Rental platforms Booking and Airbnb also aid illegal settlements by listing properties and hotel rooms in Israeli-occupied territory. The report named the US’s Drummond Company and Switzerland’s Glencore as the primary suppliers of coal for electricity to Israel, originating primarily from Colombia. In the agriculture sector, Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which benefits from land seized from Palestinians in Israel’s illegal outposts. Netafim, a company providing drip irrigation technology that is 80-percent owned by Mexico’s Orbia Advance Corporation, provides infrastructure to exploit water resources in the occupied West Bank. Treasury bonds have also played a critical role in funding the ongoing war on Gaza, according to the report, with some of the world’s largest banks, including France’s BNP Paribas and the UK’s Barclays, listed as having stepped in to allow Israel to contain the interest rate premium despite a credit downgrade. The report identified US multinational investment companies BlackRock and Vanguard as the main investors behind several listed companies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is listed as the second largest institutional investor in Palantir (8.6 percent), Microsoft (7.8 percent), Amazon (6.6 percent), Alphabet (6.6 percent) and IBM (8.6 per cent), and the third largest in Lockheed Martin (7.2 percent) and Caterpillar (7.5 percent). Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, is the largest institutional investor in Caterpillar (9.8 percent), Chevron (8.9 percent) and Palantir (9.1 percent), and the second largest in Lockheed Martin (9.2 percent) and Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems (2 percent). The report states that “colonial endeavours and their associated genocides have historically been driven and enabled by the corporate sector.” Israel’s expansion on Palestinian land is one example of “colonial racial capitalism”, where corporate entities profit from an illegal occupation. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, “entities that previously enabled and profited from Palestinian elimination and erasure within the economy of occupation, instead of disengaging are now involved in the economy of genocide,” the report said. For foreign arms companies, the war has been a lucrative venture. Israel’s military spending from 2023 to 2024 surged 65 percent, amounting to $46.5bn – one of the highest per capita worldwide. Several entities listed on the exchange market – particularly in the arms, tech and infrastructure sectors – have seen their profits rise since October 2023. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also rose an unprecedented 179 percent, adding $157.9bn in market value. Global insurance companies, including Allianz and AXA, invested large sums in shares and bonds linked to Israel’s occupation, the report said, partly as capital reserves but primarily to generate returns. Booking and Airbnb also continue to profit from rentals in Israeli-occupied land. Airbnb briefly delisted properties on illegal settlements in 2018 but later reverted to donating profits from such listings to humanitarian causes, a practice the report referred to as “humanitarian-washing”. According to Albanese’s report, yes. Corporate entities are under an obligation to avoid violating human rights through direct action or in their business partnerships. States have the primary responsibility to ensure that corporate entities respect human rights and must prevent, investigate and punish abuses by private actors. However, corporations must respect human rights even if the state where they operate does not. A company must therefore assess whether activities or relationships throughout its supply chain risk causing human rights violations or contributing to them, according to the report. The failure to act in line with international law may result in criminal liability. Individual executives can be held criminally liable, including before international courts. The report called on companies to divest from all activities linked to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, which is illegal under international law. In July 2024, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion ruling that Israel’s continued presence in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem should come to an end “as rapidly as possible”. In light of this advisory opinion, the UN General Assembly demanded that Israel bring to an end its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory by September 2025. Albanese’s report said the ICJ’s ruling “effectively qualifies the occupation as an act of aggression … Consequently, any dealings that support or sustain the occupation and its associated apparatus may amount to complicity in an international crime under the Rome Statute. “States must not provide aid or assistance or enter into economic or trade dealings, and must take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that would assist in maintaining the illegal situation created by Israel in the oPt.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. In a period marked by investor caution in the U.S. tech sector, Broadcom Inc. AVGO stands out with a 63% stock rally in just three months. Let’s unpack the compelling narrative behind Broadcom’s exceptional outperformance, delving into its strong second-quarter 2025 results, positive analyst sentiment, and future outlook. Broadcom, a dominant force in the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) market, focuses on high-performance computing, networking, and storage applications. The company designs and manufactures custom silicon chips for specific tasks, offering high-speed computing, networking, and data center infrastructure advantages. Broadcom’s stock increased by 63% in the last three months, while the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), which includes Broadcom, gained 30% during the same period. Also Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Lead Fund Manager Buys Even As Semiconductor Sector Cools: Analysts This performance comes even as the U.S. tech sector navigates investor apprehension regarding the sustainability of substantial AI investments by tech giants and the implications of the Trump administration’s tariff policies. Currently, AVGO trades near its 52-week high of approximately $276. Analysts generally hold a positive outlook on Broadcom, with a consensus price forecast of $387.68 based on ratings from 29 analysts. The highest target is $1950, issued by Bernstein on June 13, 2024. The three most recent analyst ratings were released by Citigroup, Barclays, and Susquehanna in June 2025. Broadcom’s second-quarter 2025 revenue reached $15 billion, a 20% increase year-over-year, driven by its AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. This revenue figure slightly exceeded analyst estimates of $14.99 billion. The company’s quarterly AI revenue grew 46% to over $4.4 billion, attributed to demand for AI networking. Broadcom generated approximately $6.56 billion in cash from operations and $6.41 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $1.58 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.56. For the third quarter, Broadcom expects revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, aligning with estimates of $15.79 billion. It anticipates AI semiconductor revenue to reach $5.1 billion in the third quarter. These results prompted analysts to adjust price targets for the stock, citing growth in AI-related revenue and demand for networking solutions. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted Broadcom’s potential for long-term AI revenue growth, supported by increased capital expenditures from major cloud firms and the adoption of its custom ASIC silicon. Rosenblatt’s Kevin Cassidy highlighted Broadcom’s visibility into AI growth through key XPU customers and the company’s Ethernet scale-up adoption for LLM training and inference. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Matthew Prisco projects AI semiconductor revenue to exceed $20 billion in 2025 and $30 billion in 2026. Broadcom’s stock has dramatically outpaced its peers, with a 68% surge over the last 12 months compared to the PHLX Semiconductor’s modest 1.3%. In the first half of 2025, Broadcom gained 19% outpacing the S&P 500 gain of 6% and Nasdaq’s 15.5%. The year 2024 was particularly significant, as Broadcom joined the exclusive “trillion-dollar valuation club,” alongside Nvidia Corp. NVDA, fueled by the intensifying AI frenzy. In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom’s revenue reached an impressive $51.6 billion, marking a 44% increase. Semiconductor revenue contributed $30.1 billion, with AI revenue alone soaring 220% to $12.2 billion, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. The integration of VMware significantly boosted infrastructure software revenue to $21.5 billion. The company also notably doubled its AI XPU shipments to hyperscale customers. Despite a significant reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM for nearly 95% of its wafers in fiscal 2024, Broadcom maintained a substantial 64% gross margin, showcasing its strong pricing power and market position. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed strong confidence in December last year, stating that the company could generate tens of billions in annual AI chip revenue by 2027, driven by increasing demand from prominent AI developers like OpenAI and xAI. Analysts echo this optimism. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted that Broadcom has secured multi-year AI ASIC deals with OpenAI and a fifth major client, estimating a $150 billion AI semiconductor opportunity through 2029. BofA Securities’ Vivek Arya believes ASICs could capture 10-15% of the AI accelerator market, supporting Broadcom’s growth even as Nvidia retains a significant market share.

Title: These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years.

Title: Ex-Dividend Reminder: American Express, Globe Life And Cisco Systems

ByDividend Channel ByDividend Channel, Contributor. On 7/3/25, American Express, Globe Life, and Cisco Systems will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. American Express will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.82 on 8/8/25, Globe Life will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.27 on 8/1/25, and Cisco Systems will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.41 on 7/23/25. 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of AXP's recent stock price of $318.98, this dividend works out to approximately 0.26%, so look for shares of American Express to trade 0.26% lower — all else being equal — when AXP shares open for trading on 7/3/25. Similarly, investors should look for GL to open 0.22% lower in price and for CSCO to open 0.59% lower, all else being equal. When an S&P 1500 component reaches 20 years of dividend increases, it becomes a contender to join the elite "Dividend Aristocrats" index. Cisco Systems is a "future dividend aristocrats contender," with 14+ years of increases. Below are dividend history charts for AXP, GL, and CSCO, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. American Express: AXP Globe Life: GL Cisco Systems: CSCO In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.03% for American Express, 0.87% for Globe Life, and 2.36% for Cisco Systems. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Tuesday trading, American Express shares are currently up about 0.6%, Globe Life shares are up about 0.3%, and Cisco Systems shares are up about 1.1% on the day.

July 01, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower as investors monitor trade talks and Senate budget negotiations; Tesla (TSLA) shares are falling in premarket trading as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalates again; Apple (AAPL) reportedly could turn to OpenAI or Anthropic for help enhancing its Siri voice-activated service; Oracle (ORCL) shares are hovering near the all-time high set Monday after the software provider reported lucrative new cloud deals; and Amazon's (AMZN) robotic workforce reportedly nears the size of its human staff in its warehouses. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower in premarket trading as investors monitor trade talks and Senate deliberations of budget legislation. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are down 0.2% after both indexes posted fresh all-time closing highs yesterday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are ticking lower. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and the 10-year Treasury yield are lower. Oil and gold futures are higher. Tesla shares are more than 5% lower in premarket trading as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump heats up again. "Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, hours after Musk again criticized the "One Big Beautiful Bill" being debated in the Senate, which includes a provision that would eliminate the $7,500 new EV tax credit. During the initial escalation of the public spat between Musk and Trump on June 5, shares tumbled 14%, erasing more than $150 billion from Tesla's market capitalization. Apple (AAPL) could turn to ChatGPT maker OpenAI or Anthropic after delays in the launch of its highly anticipated AI-enhanced Siri, according to a Bloomberg report. The iPhone maker has been in talks with both companies about using AI models instead of in-house technology, the report said, after significant delays have raised pressure on Apple to prove it can compete with other tech leaders on AI development. Shares of Apple are 0.6% higher in premarket trading after closing 2% higher yesterday following the report. Oracle (ORCL) shares are edging higher in premarket trading after closing at an all-time high of $218.63 Monday as CEO Safra Catz touted what she called a "strong start" to fiscal 2026, with several lucrative cloud deals, "including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28." Analysts at Stifel reportedly raised their price target for Oracle stock to $250 per share from $180, pointing to Oracle's strong cloud growth. Amazon (AMZN) soon will have as many robots working in its warehouses as it does humans, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Roughly 75% of the e-commerce giant's global deliveries "are assisted in some way by robotics," the Journal said, adding that "the average number of employees Amazon had per facility last year, roughly 670, was the lowest recorded in the past 16 years." Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expected the company would trim its workforce over the next few years with the spread of artificial intelligence. Amazon shares are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: Meta stock hits a record high as Mark Zuckerberg reveals poached new recruits from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google

Beatrice Nolan is a London-based reporter at Fortune covering tech. Meta stock hit an all-time high on Monday following the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recruited an all-star Superintelligence team that includes key architects of ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and its image-gen tech. The company’s stock peaked at $747.90 during Monday trading, beating Meta’s previous record set in February this year. Shares closed Monday at a record $738.09, marking a 23% year-to-date gain. Investors cheered the company’s aggressive push into AI and its hiring spree of talent from major rivals in the space, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Meta’s new Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang posted the list of new recruits on X. Wang recently joined the company as part of a deal that saw Meta investing up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in his training data company, ScaleAI. Zuckerberg reportedly told staff that former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman will co-lead the group with Wang. “I’m excited to be the Chief AI Officer, working alongside [Nat Friedman],” he wrote in a post. “We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I’m excited to share as well.” The team includes several prominent former OpenAI researchers, including: Representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune, made outside normal working hours. Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally recruiting for Meta’s new 50-person “Superintelligence” AI team, reportedly offering $100m signing bonuses to woo top OpenAI researchers, according to CEO Sam Altman. OpenAI is reportedly scrambling to contain the fallout after a wave of high-profile researcher departures to Meta, with Chief Research Officer Mark Chen likening the exodus to a home invasion. In a memo obtained by Wired, Chen told employees that OpenAI’s leadership team, including Altman, had been working “around the clock” to retain the company’s top talent, urgently recalibrating compensation and seeking “creative” ways to reward top performers. While Altman publicly complained about rumored $100 million signing bonuses, Meta has internally disputed the figure. In a recent all-hands meeting shared with The Verge, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth said the actual offers Meta was making were more complicated and implied that only a few very senior people may have been offered that kind of money. He clarified that “the actual terms of the offer” weren’t just “sign-on bonus” but rather “all these different things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Seagate Stock To $85?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/07: In this photo illustration, the Seagate Technology logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: How would you respond if you owned Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) and its value plummeted by 60% or more in the upcoming months? While this may seem extreme, it is not without precedent. Seagate's stock has experienced such severe declines previously, and based on its current valuation, history might repeat itself. Up to this point in 2025, Seagate has achieved an impressive 65% return year-to-date, significantly exceeding the S&P 500’s 5% increase. This rise has been driven by structural improvements in the company and a timely shift towards next-gen technologies like HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is currently benefiting from a upswing in the data-storage market, which is being bolstered by the increasing demand for generative AI and cloud infrastructure. However, behind the AI enthusiasm and operational improvements lies a more cautionary narrative. Separately see, What’s Next For Nike Stock? Here’s the point: The main takeaway is that during a downturn, Seagate stock could suffer considerable losses. Data from 2020 shows that STX stock lost around 35% of its value within just a few quarters, experiencing a peak-to-trough drop of about 58% during the 2022 inflation crisis, underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock see a sell-off and potentially fall to $85 if a similar scenario were to occur? As a rule, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. Consequently, if you seek growth with decreased volatility, you might want to investigate the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns over 91% since its launch. Seagate produces high-capacity HDDs (hard disk drives)—essential infrastructure for storing the immense datasets necessary for training and deploying large language models (LLMs). While SSDs (solid-state drives) are the go-to choice for fast-access storage, HDDs remain dominant in cold storage and hyperscale cloud archives—key applications for companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. Seagate introduced its Mozaic 3+ platform last year, which achieves 3 TB per platter through HAMR technology and incorporates it into its Exos 30 TB+ drives, which have already begun shipping to hyperscale cloud clients. At its June 2025 investor conference, Seagate announced that engineering samples of 40 TB HAMR drives (10×4 TB platters) have already been delivered, with mass production anticipated in the first half of FY 2026. The company intends to launch Mozaic 4+ with 40 TB+ capacity in 2026, followed by Mozaic 5+ providing 50 TB+ drives by 2028, and is aiming for 100 TB HDDs by 2030 as part of its larger HAMR roadmap. While this technological advancement positions Seagate for long-term growth, it also introduces execution risks if demand does not scale as expected. Seagate forecasts Q4 adjusted EPS (June fiscal year) to be between $2.20 and $2.60, with revenue expected between $2.25–$2.55 billion. Consensus is predicting 38% revenue growth in FY 2025 and 13% in FY 2026. Nevertheless, even solid growth expectations cannot safeguard the stock from macroeconomic shocks, valuation declines, or operational setbacks. With very little margin for error, any misstep could lead to a steep correction. STX stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could it get if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • STX stock decreased 58.2% from a high of $116.02 on 4 January 2022 to $48.49 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 May 2025 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $141.44 on 29 June 2025 • STX stock fell 35.6% from a high of $63.23 on 24 January 2020 to $40.73 on 20 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 4 December 2020 • STX stock dropped 89.1% from a high of $28.60 on 2 November 2007 to $3.11 on 23 January 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 April 2012 Currently, Seagate trades at 18x consensus 2025 earnings, significantly above its three-year average of only 5x. Its price-to-sales ratio has escalated to 3x, rising from 1.2x in FY 2022. Even its forward P/S of 3x surpasses the three-year average of 2.8x. In comparison, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), a direct competitor, typically trades around 1x P/S during market downturns. Investor confidence is evidently reflected in the stock’s elevated valuation—but with greater height comes a steeper potential fall. The average analyst price target of $125 suggests an 11% downside, even without factoring in a market correction. Considering the wider economic uncertainties, ask yourself this: Do you plan to hold onto your Seagate stock now, or will you panic and sell if it starts to drop to $100, $90, or even lower? Hanging onto a declining stock is never an easy task. Trefis partners with Empirical Asset Management—an investment firm in the Boston area—whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation framework to offer clients better returns and less risk compared to the benchmark index—a smoother journey, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. On Friday (June 27th), both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record levels. This occurred despite growing evidence of a slowing economy and continued trade angst.1 Meanwhile, the DJIA is still -2.65% away from its 12/4/24 peak (45,014.04) and the small cap Russell 2000 remains off more than -11% from its 11/25/24 high (2,442.03).2 This isn’t a surprise to us as the industrial economy and especially small caps always feel an economic slowdown before it becomes mainstream. In addition, the DJIA and Russell 2000 have many fewer tech companies, the sector where the action is. The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The table above shows that all the major indexes had a good week and month. For the year, the S&P 500 is up about 5% (about where is should be halfway through a typical 10% growth year), while the other three major indexes are lagging. The Nasdaq is up less than 1% while the DJIA (industrials) and the Russell 2000 (small cap) are underwater year to date (with the Russell 2000 off more than -5%). So, a mixed bag.1 2 Five of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, META and GOOG) enjoyed a prosperous week. AAPL and TSLA were marginally positive. For the year to date, it is really a mixed bag. AAPL and TSLA are down nearly -20%, and GOOG is down more than -6%. Meanwhile META, NVDA and MSFT show substantial gains, while AMZN is just keeping its head above water. Nevertheless, on Friday, NVDA closed at a new record high.3 4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The Consumer As the consumer goes, so goes the economy. So, when the consumers’ income falls, or inflation rises faster than that income, real consumption growth is negatively impacted. So, it isn’t good news to learn that personal earnings (excluding government transfers) fell in May (-0.1%) and have been negative in three of the past four months. Perhaps this is responsible for the -0.1% drop in consumer spending in May which, after including the effects of inflation, amounts to -0.3% in real terms. There was a fall in spending on durable goods of -1.8%, -0.3% for non-durables, and services were essentially flat (-0.03%).5 There are other signs of consumer discomfort. One such sign is the rise in the number of multiple job holders. This occurs when the income from a single job isn’t sufficient to maintain that worker’s lifestyle. Either live at a lower level or get a second job! The chart shows a steady upward trend in this statistic since the pandemic.6 Bureau of Labor Statistics Other such signs can be seen in the delinquency rates on consumer loans. Delinquencies on mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit are on the rise. The left-hand side of the chart below shows that credit card balances are at record levels as consumers try to maintain their standard of living (Charge it now – worry about paying for it later!). Note the rapid rise in delinquencies (right-hand side of the chart below) in the post-pandemic period. Note that while credit card delinquencies of 90+ days appear to have come down recently, this is most likely due to increased write-offs of such debt by the financial (bank) system.7 8 FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel, Equifax, Bloomberg Finally, a look at the major retailer reports reinforces the aggregate data. Best Buy, for example, recently cut its sales forecast for 2025. Kohl’s reported -3.9% sales growth in Q1, and went on to forecast -5% to -7% for 2025 as a whole. Foot Locker reported that sales fell -2.6% from year earlier levels, and Hormel trimmed its earnings outlook.5Housing As always, housing is a good indicator of the economy’s economic health. The left-hand side of the chart below shows the slowdown in Existing Home Sales over the past couple of years, and the right-hand side indicates the rapid rise in the months’ supply of inventory at current sales rates (now higher than the pandemic peak). This is a sign of growing weakness and inevitably leads to a slowdown in new home construction with spillover effects into the labor market. National Association of Realtors and Bureau of Labor Statistics Note in the New Home Sales chart below the horizontal trend since 2023 and the latest turndown in 2025. U.S. Census Bureau As demand stagnates, so do home prices. As seen from the chart below, the median sales price of new homes has stagnated for the past two years. Final Thoughts Equity markets continued their upward path the week ended June 27th with record highs for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. It was a good week and a good month for stocks. But this rising tide has put the P/E ratio significantly above its long-term mean. Investors beware! For 2025, the S&P 500 leads the pack, up nearly 5%, while small-caps also carry a “5” growth number, but with a negative sign.1 2 It was also a positive week for all of the Magnificent 7 (AAPL barely so). Year-to-date, the stock prices of four of the Mag 7 are positive and three are negative, with AAPL and TSLA each down nearly -20%!3 4 As the consumer goes, so does the economy. One can see the stress developing in the consumer sector by looking at the rising trend of multiple job holders and the rise in both credit card balances and 90+ day delinquencies.6 7 8 Housing is always a bellwether of the economy. The fact that Existing Home Sales have tanked and New Home Sales have flatlined tells an astute observer that the economy has entered rocky ground.

Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages.

(NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

(DV) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.
