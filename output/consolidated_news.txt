Institutional demand returned to Ethereum as network costs collapsed, yet momentum lagged. Ethereum rebounded on the 26th of January, posting $117 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs. Fidelity dominated the session, recording $137 million in inflows and snapping a four-day outflow streak. Source: X By contrast, BlackRock registered net outflows on the day. That divergence highlighted selective institutional positioning rather than broad-based accumulation. The reversal in ETF flows followed multiple sessions of sustained outflows. That shift left traders focused on whether institutions were rebuilding exposure or executing short-term reallocations. Even so, inflows alone did not guarantee immediate price expansion. Glassnode data showed Ethereum’s Total Transaction Fees fell to their lowest level since May 2017 on the 27th of January. Source: Glassnode This sharp decline boosted scalability and security, driving the ecosystem forward. Lower fees solidified a healthier ecosystem, but the real challenge remains sustaining explosive long-term growth. This mirrors the powerful expansions of 2017 and 2021 when fees also dropped to these levels. Ethereum’s liquidity clusters around $2,900 and $2,850 offered crucial downside support. Large buy orders in these zones triggered accumulation from whales, creating solid backing. Source: CoinGlass But what happens if the price drops below these levels? Will market makers hunt that liquidity, causing a cascading effect and leading to a deeper pullback? At the time of writing, Ethereum [ETH] was trading at $2,908. Reclaiming and breaking the $3,000 level became the new benchmark. A successful reclaim and clearing of the downtrend could have pushed Ethereum toward the $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone. Source: TradingView However, momentum indicators like the MACD showed signs of weakness, and the RSI was in the 40s, indicating a lack of strong buying momentum. Ethereum’s ability to break the $3,000 resistance would have defined its next move.

Asian shares are mixed after the S&P 500 ticked to a record and the U.S. dollar's value slid further Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday after the S&P 500 ticked to a record, as the U.S. dollar’s value slid further. Later Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its next move on interest rates. The expectation is that it will hold its main interest rate steady for now. South Korea’s benchmark hit a record, lifted by gains for technology shares like computer chip maker SK Hynix, which climbed 3%. The Kospi was up 1.3% at 5,152.14. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.5% to 53,055.58. The dollar rebounded slightly against the Japanese yen but has still weakened sharply since last week, putting pressure on shares of major exporters. Toyota Motor Corp. lost 3% and other major manufacturers also extended losses. The dollar was trading at 152.75 yen, up from 152.19 yen. But it's nearly 4% lower than its level last week, when it surged to near 160 yen, prompting both Japanese and U.S. officials to warn they will intervene to stanch the yen's decline. The euro slipped to $1.1995 from $1.2041 late Monday. It also has surged against the dollar. An index measuring the U.S. dollar’s strength against several of its competitors has dropped to its lowest point since 2022. The price of gold jumped nearly 3% to surpass $5,200, and silver’s price jumped 9%. Prices of precious metals have been soaring as investors have sold dollars to park their money in assets considered to be relatively safe in times of turmoil. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 2.4% to 27,782.59, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 4,160.01. Taiwan's Taiex advanced 1.1%, while the Sensex in India gained 0.5%. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks zigzagged following mixed profit reports from UnitedHealth, General Motors and other big companies. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks will deliver their latest earnings reports later this week. They include Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,978.60, edging past its prior all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% to 49,003.41, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9% to 23,817.10. The dollar has weakened since President Donald Trump threatened tariffs against several European countries that he said opposed his taking control of Greenland. Such threats, along with worries about risks like the U.S. government’s heavy debt, have periodically pushed global investors to step back from U.S. markets, a move that’s come to be called “Sell America.” On Wall Street, Corning helped lead the market higher and climbed 15.6% after announcing a deal with Meta Platforms worth up to $6 billion. Corning will supply optical fiber and cable to help build out data centers for Meta, enough that Corning is expanding its optical-fiber manufacturing facility in Hickory, North Carolina. Also supporting the U.S. stock market were gains for General Motors, which rose 8.7%, and hospital-operator HCA Healthcare, which rallied 7.1%. Both delivered profits for the end of 2025 that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Each also approved programs to send billions of dollars to their investors by buying back their own stock. A report from the Conference Board said confidence weakened among U.S. consumers last month. Economists had expected to see a slight improvement, but confidence dropped to its lowest level since 2014, even lower than it was during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, and lower interest rates could worsen increases in prices for U.S. consumers at the same time that they give the economy a boost. Traders expect the Fed to resume its cuts to interest rates later this year. The pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits following record-setting runs for their stock prices. Stock prices tend to follow the path of corporate profits over the long term, and earnings need to rise to quiet criticism that stock prices have grown too expensive. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 42 cents to $62.81 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 34 cents at $66.93 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: The History of Disney Animation

Subscribe Apple | Spotify | Amazon |iHeart Radio | Castbox | Podcast Republic | RSS | Patreon | Discord | Facebook | IMDB Disney is one of the most popular and well-known brands in the world.They are a massive conglomerate of movie studios, television networks, a cruise line, and theme parks. The massive company we know today, however, had much more humble beginnings. It all began with a man and a cartoon mouse. Learn about the history of Disney Animation on this episode of Everything Everywhere Daily. Walter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, to Elias and Flora Disney. His family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Marceline, Missouri. Walt Disney had been an artist from a young age. He loved drawing animals, inspired by his childhood on a farm in Missouri.During World War I, Disney attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army but was rejected for being underage. He instead joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps and served in France after the armistice, where he continued drawing cartoons for fellow soldiers.After returning to the United States, he worked briefly as a commercial artist in Kansas City and became fascinated by animation, then a young and experimental medium. In 1922, he founded Laugh-O-Gram Studio, producing short animated films inspired by fairy tales. The studio failed financially, leaving Disney bankrupt but determined to continue. In 1923, Walt moved to California to be closer to his older brother Roy, who was recovering from tuberculosis, and to pursue a career in the movie business. It was there that he and his brother formed the Disney Brothers Studio. The original studio operated out of their uncle’s garage in Los Angeles. The brothers then relocated to a small office and from there, they moved to larger office spaces. The company was renamed Walt Disney Studios in 1926 because Roy believed the company should reflect his brother’s artistic vision. Roy provided financial and business direction, but wanted the company to showcase Walt’s creativity. The production of Alice Comedies marked their beginning; these were silent short films that combined animation and live-action elements. Alice Comedies was distributed by Winkler Pictures and was successful, leading to a second series, which Universal Pictures distributed in 1927. The new series, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was completely animated. Oswald was the first “true” breakout cartoon star made by the studio. The character was considered to be charming, a bit troublesome, and lovable. After the first year of producing Oswald, Disney went to Winkler Studios in New York to renew his contract with the studio. However, the new owner of the studio wanted to cut his pay by a considerable amount, and Disney refused to take the pay cut. Universal then acquired the rights to Oswald and set up a new studio to produce Oswald Cartoons, taking most of Disney’s staff. Meanwhile, in secret, Disney began working on a new project of his own, wanting to maintain the rights to produce and distribute their own character. Disney brought together some of his most loyal staff members and animators to create cartoons featuring a new original character, Mickey Mouse.If you go and search online, you’ll see more than a striking resemblance between Oswald the Rabbit and Mickey Mouse. The first two Mickey Mouse cartoons were produced in 1928 and had limited engagement. However, the third cartoon, Steamboat Willie, was the first Disney cartoon with synchronized sound and was a smash hit, and became the most popular cartoon in the United States. Piggybacking on Mickey Mouse’s success, Disney produced another round of sound cartoons known as Silly Symphonies in 1929. The most famous of which was “Skeleton Dance.” That same year, Walt Disney Studios had a financial dispute with its sound-on-film provider, leading to its reincorporation as Walt Disney Productions. After its renaming, Walt Disney Productions signed a new distribution partnership with Columbia Pictures. Disney worked with Columbia Pictures for two years before signing with United Artists in 1932. At the same time, Disney also signed a deal with Technicolor. Technicolor allowed Disney Studios to use its 3-strip color film process. This process allows the cartoons to be produced in color by passing the film through dye and light filters. As a result, Disney could now produce full-color animated shorts. Around the same time, in the early 1930s, Disney realized that to continue producing successful films, he needed to tell stories with emotionally compelling narratives. Realizing this need, Disney established a story department where Disney Studios is credited with inventing the technique of storyboarding. This technique involved drawing individual scenes on paper and then arranging them sequentially on a bulletin board. The first production to use storyboarding was the Silly Symphony cartoon, “The Three Little Pigs.” This short became another massive hit for the studio, proving the technique’s effectiveness. In 1934, Disney told key staff members of his plan to produce an animated feature film. When news of the studio’s plan to produce a film reached the rest of the industry, the studio faced mockery, with the film dubbed “Disney’s Folly.” Despite the ridicule, Disney continued to produce the film. It was to be the first full length animated feature film produced in English and in Technicolor. To achieve this dream, Disney expanded its studios and hired new animators and artists. The company trained them in animation techniques. It used previous projects like Silly Symphonies to experiment with new animation methods, effects, and cameras. Disney spent roughly $1.4 million, which was an enormous amount of money at that time, especially for an animated film. The investment proved to be the right decision. The film, which was released in 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became a box-office hit. At that point, it was the highest-grossing movie of all time, bringing in $8 million at the box office. If you include all of its theatrical re-releases and media sales over the years, it has made over a billion dollars, not adjusted for inflation. This opened the door for the studio to produce more animated feature films. While Snow White was under production, work on Disney’s other properties, Silly Symphonies and Mickey Mouse, continued. Mickey Mouse received the Technicolor treatment in 1935, and the cartoon added multiple supporting characters, including Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy. These three characters gained their own cartoons by 1940, with Donald Duck actually surpassing Mickey in popularity. With the success of these new cartoons, Silly Symphonies, which at this point had numerous awards, including Academy Awards, ceased production in 1939. With the success of Snow White, Disney was able to build a new, larger studio. This new studio was completed in 1940 on Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California, where it still stands today. That same year, Disney Studios also went public, offering shares to investors on the stock market. Another big moment for the studio in 1940 was the release of their second animated film, Pinocchio. The film was not an initial success, bringing in less than Snow White and less than the studio expected. While not a box-office success, it was a critical hit, earning praise from critics and winning Academy Awards for “Best Original Song” and “Best Original Score.” This made Pinocchio Disney’s first film to win either of these Oscars. Also released in 1940 was an experimental film called Fantasia. This film was another financial failure for the studio, due to limited engagement and the high cost of installing the necessary sound equipment for the film’s orchestral score. Yet, despite the financial failure, the film was another critical hit, winning two Honorary Academy Awards in 1942.As an aside, Fantasia is a fantastic film, as is its follow-up, Fantasia 2000. A significant setback hit the company in 1941 when a four-month strike by animators, driven by anger over pay inequity, led to the departure of several key studio animators. To resolve the dispute, Disney agreed to several terms: establishing an employee union, rehiring animators who had been fired during the strike, equalizing employee pay, and implementing a clearer salary structure. Following the strike, the film in production at the time, Dumbo, was released in 1941. This film was a financial success; however, it was followed by Bambi in 1942, which was considered another financial failure. Following Bambi’s disappointment, production on animated films was halted. This, in tandem with World War II, which cut off international markets, led banks to give the studio money only on shorts. This meant that the films in production at the time, like Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and Peter Pan, were placed on hold until the war’s end. During World War II, Disney was hired to produce propaganda films for the war effort. During the war, about 95% of the studio’s content was made for the US Military. The studio also produced live-action material that was used in other content. After World War II, the studio refocused on feature film projects. The first of these was Cinderella. Given Bambi’s lack of success and the inability to release feature films for eight years, the studio’s future was dependent on the success of Cinderella. When Cinderella hit theaters in 1950, it was an instant box-office sensation. The windfall from Cinderella empowered Disney to finally bring long-awaited productions like Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and Peter Pan to life. Each of these former “limbo” projects found success at the box office, ranging from solid performances to stunning hits. The success of Cinderella also gave the studio the freedom to produce other, riskier films, namely 1959’s Sleeping Beauty, which was in production for ten years. In the mid 1950s, Walt Disney began shifting his focus to other endeavors, such as theme parks, live-action movies, and television, while the animation studios continued to produce films. However, with Walt focusing his attention elsewhere, projects like Sleeping Beauty were left in the hands of core animators and directors. This led to production taking longer and costing more. Despite its box-office success, Sleeping Beauty‘s high development cost led to Disney Animation’s first financial loss in ten years, resulting in layoffs. The 1950s also saw other shifts at the studio, including the cessation of regular production for many short subjects, such as Mickey Mouse. Between 1960 and 1970, Disney released more successful animated films and continued to invest in projects outside animation. The most important of these with respect to animation was the California Institute of the Arts. Disney had a history of training and educating animators at its studio, but with the founding of CalArts, Disney was able to offer its own developed animation program, which allowed animators to earn a degree and served as a way to funnel new talent into the studio. Walt Disney died of lung cancer in December 1966, and five years later, Roy died.As a side note, Walt Disney’s body was not frozen after he died. This rumor started because his death coincided with the first body being frozen, and people put two and two together to create an urban legend.The studio maintained profitability following the deaths of its founders, achieving it through several strategies: reducing the evilness of its villains, prioritizing advertising to children and families, and implementing cost-saving measures such as repurposing animation from earlier films. The animation studio struggled to produce popular films in the 1980s. This difficulty arose from the declining market for animated family films, which prevented the studio from capturing a significant share of the teenage and adult audience. The challenge was compounded by changes in studio leadership. However, there was one notable animation technique that was used by Disney during this period that needs to be mentioned. In The Great Mouse Detective, released in 1986, Disney dabbled in computer animation to help animate some of the film.This technique would revolutionize animation in the decades that followed. At the end of the 80’s, began a transformative period for Disney Animation, known as the Disney Renaissance. The beginning of the Renaissance was 1989s The Little Mermaid, the studio’s biggest success in decades. The Disney Renaissance of the 1990s was responsible for the release of several of the studio’s most popular and cherished films, such as Aladdin, The Lion King, and Mulan. Following the Renaissance and into the 2000s, Disney entered another difficult period. The success of animation at Disney and other studios led to a drastic rise in animator costs. Massive lay-offs in the studio occurred, and the studio was forced to shift to cheaper computer animation. By 2004, the studio had fully transitioned to using Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) for all production. This shift enabled the studio to downsize its staff and subsequently sell off a significant portion of its hand-drawing equipment. In January 2006, Disney finalized a crucial deal with Pixar, its main animation rival. This agreement was mutually beneficial for both studios. While largely maintaining separate animation operations, the deal significantly shifted Disney’s approach, transitioning its product focus from executive control to filmmaker-led development. Disney revolutionized the art of animation. It was not only at the forefront of technologies such as sound and color, but also innovations in storytelling. The result has been films that have been enjoyed by billions of people for almost 100 years.

The New Zealand sharemarket took on a cautious tone and fell nearly 1% as inflation creeps up on both sides of the Tasman and creates fears of interest rate hikes. The S&P/NZX 50 Index was on a downward slide all day and closed at 13,412.87, declining 98.01 points or 0.73%. There were 49 gainers and 83 decliners on the main board, with 33.09 million shares worth $114.98 million changing hands. Things got nervy after the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that Australia’s annual inflation increased to 3.8% at the end of December, from 3.4% recorded in November. This followed the New Zealand inflation increase from 3% to 3.1% in the December quarter – the highest annual rate since the June 2024 quarter, when it was 3.3%. Mark Lister, investment director with Craigs Investment Partners, said “inflation is not dead and buried – it’s lower than it was but still higher than we want it to be”. He said the market has firmed up an expectation of an interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week, and “we could see a hike here sooner than we thought, even before the end of the year”. Lister said the market was weaker because of the inflation surprises over the past week and some key events that will be happening over the next 24 hours. The US Federal Reserve is meeting and is expected to keep interest rates on hold. “There is a lot of focus on the Fed with the Justice Department investigation and chair Jerome Powell’s term expiring in May,” Lister said. “We’ve got the latest earnings results from Apple, Meta [the Facebook parent] and Tesla, and investors are eagerly awaiting how they will look. Gold continues to power ahead and the US dollar is out of favour – there’s plenty of reasons to be a little cautious.” The gold price was up a further 3% to US$5240 an ounce, and the New Zealand dollar was back over US60c against the American greenback, trading at US60.16c after reaching an intraday high of US60.5c. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 reached a new high after increasing 0.41% to 6978.6 points and nearly breaching the historic 7000 mark. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.91% to 23,817.1 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, weighed down by the health insurance stocks, declined 0.83% to 49,003.41. Across the Tasman, the S&P/ASX 200 Index was down 0.18% to 8925.1 points at 6pm NZT. Back home, Ebos Group continued to be sold off, falling 65c or 2.44% to $26 – the stock was last at that level in October 2020. Infratil was down 18c to $10.97; Summerset declined 24c or 2.05% to $11.49; Skellerup shed 8c to $5.20; Sky TV decreased 6c or 1.77% to $3.33; and Eroad fell 6c or 4.55% to $1.26. In the retail sector, Hallenstein Glasson was up 10c to $9.70, and Briscoe Group was down 13c or 2.55% to $4.97. The property sector on the market slumped 1.84% as bond yields continued to rise. The New Zealand 10-Year Government Bond yield was up slightly to 4.637% and the 2 Year to 3.38%. Goodman Property Trust declined 4.5c or 2.28% to $1.925; Investore was down 2c or 1.75% to $1.12; Kiwi Property decreased 2.5c or 2.43% to $1.005; and Precinct Properties shed 2.5c or 2.14% to $1.14. Argosy Property was down 2.5c or 2.06% to $1.19; Vital Healthcare Trust also eased 2.5c to $1.96, and Stride and Property for Industry decreased 2c to $1.30 and $2.31, respectively. Green Cross Health increased 7c or 5.69% to $1.30, and Blackpearl Group was up 3.5c or 3.55% to $1.02. Dual-listed Minerals Exploration was down 2c or 6.67% to 28c after telling the market it has started test drilling at the flagship Waitekauri Jubilee gold mine near Waihī after collecting rock chip samples at the Scotia prospect. The company said the Waitekauri project is 8km west of OceanaGold’s Waihī Gold Mine and in the centre of a heavily gold-mineralised structural corridor. Minerals Exploration had $4.5m in cash at the end of December. Fellow miner Santana Minerals rebounded 11c or 8.94% to $1.34. Cooks Coffee, with outlets in Britain and Ireland, was up 1.5c or 6.98% to 23c after announcing it is expanding its Esquires chain to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), including Dubai. Cooks has organised an initial 10-year master franchise agreement with the UAE, providing a minimum total of 50 Esquires Coffee outlets during that period.

Amazon on Tuesday appeared to have prematurely alerted Amazon Web Services cloud-computing employees to layoffs planned for Wednesday morning by sending a commiseration email and team-wide meeting invitation hours early. Reuters reported on Friday that Amazon intended to lay off thousands of ‍corporate employees ⁠starting this week. But the company has not yet informed impacted employees, nor has it confirmed the layoff plan. The email sent on Tuesday signed by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrongly said that impacted employees in the U.S., Canada ​and Costa Rica had already been informed they lost ‌their jobs. In Slack messages viewed by Reuters, AWS employees who received the email said the Wednesday meeting was almost immediately canceled. Amazon ​referred in the email to the layoffs as “Project Dawn.” “Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, reviewed by Reuters. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jobs in the company’s units covering AWS, retail, Prime Video and human resources were slated to ‌be affected, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, though the full scope of this week’s cuts was unclear. Amazon laid off about 14,000 people ‌in October as part of a broader plan to reduce corporate staff by around 30,000, people familiar with the matter said at the ‌time. On Tuesday, Amazon cut jobs in its Fresh grocery and Go market divisions as it plans to close existing brick-and-mortar stores and convert some ‌of them to Whole ‍Foods stores. ⁠It did not ​disclose the number of affected employees. The size of the cuts to be announced on Wednesday remained unclear. The full 30,000 ⁠jobs flagged in October would represent a small portion of ⁠Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the firm’s corporate workforce. Amazon, in an October blog post, tied those job cuts to the increased use of artificial intelligence. That post ‌from the head of human resources, Beth Galetti, indicated more job cuts were likely in the future. The errant email Tuesday referred to ‌a blog post by Galetti, which has not yet appeared on Amazon’s website. Gukesh Dommaraju, the world champion, defeated 14-year-old prodigy Yagiz Kaan Ergodmus in Round 10 of the Tata Steel Chess tournament, reducing him to tears. Before this, Ergodmus had a successful tournament, beating top players and holding strong opponents to draws. However, Gukesh, who had a tough tournament so far, managed to secure a win and praised Ergodmus for his impressive performance.

This restructuring aims to separate U.S. TikTok from its Chinese parent, addressing concerns about data privacy and foreign control. The move came after years of pressure from lawmakers, who feared the Chinese government’s potential access to Americans’ data. In 2024, Congress enacted a law, mandating that TikTok’s U.S. operations be separated from ByteDance. ​Under the new structure, about 80% of the U.S. TikTok entity is owned by non-Chinese investors, with ByteDance keeping only a 19.9% share. The newly formed entity, “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC,” licenses TikTok’s recommendation algorithm from ByteDance and independently manages content moderation, and oversees data protection, algorithm security, and software controls. The managing investor group consists of Oracle, the private equity firm Silver Lake, and the investment firm MGX. Each holds a 15% stake, totaling 45% of the U.S. business. Here’s what you should know about them. Oracle is a leading cloud computing and database firm that collaborates with top companies, such as OpenAI. Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok and already provides cloud infrastructure for the app, managing its U.S. user data. Under the new deal, Oracle serves as the security partner, auditing TikTok’s compliance with U.S. security requirements, managing data storage, and overseeing updates to the content recommendation algorithm. It’s important to note that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, now the company’s executive chairman and chief technology officer, is a prominent billionaire with known connections to President Trump. MGX is an AI-focused investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates, which invests in semiconductors and data centers. The firm was created by Mubadala (Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund) and G42, an Emirati AI company. MGX’s stake in U.S. TikTok could give the firm influence over key decisions shaping TikTok’s AI direction. The firm already backs Elon Musk’s xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI and contributed to a $100 billion AI data center initiative announced by President Trump, in which Oracle is participating as well. It’s also worth pointing out that MGX has partnerships with Microsoft and BlackRock. Silver Lake, a leading U.S. private equity firm, has long invested heavily in technology companies, including Airbnb, Twitter, Dell Technologies, Tesla, and Waymo. Its role in U.S. TikTok is primarily financial and strategic, offering capital and expertise to help shape the platform’s direction.

Title: Amazon confirms 16,000 job cuts after accidental email

US technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error. The email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to "strengthen the company." The message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. Early on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to "remove bureaucracy" at the firm. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make "broad reductions every few months", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 corporate job cuts in October. "While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now," she said. Amazon employs around 1.5 million people globally, with around 350,000 in corporate roles. Amazon has not said where the latest job losses will fall or which countries will be affected. On Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers. The title of the invitation was "Send project Dawn email," an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job redundancies. While the email made clear that the cuts were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed. "This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the email said. "Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success," it added. The lay-offs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former worker who asked not be identified. The broad understanding among staff had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, the former employee added, who left Amazon as part of a redundancy round in October. The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major set of lay-offs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May. While affected workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company. Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts. Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm. In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time. Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the chief executive said he was thankful for the "challenges at opportunities at work" as "the world is changing at a very rapid rate." Jassy called this era at Amazon "a time to rethink everything we've ever done." Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.

Title: Whole Foods Customer Shops For Eggs. Then They See Where Store Is Putting Vital Farms Now Amid Controversy: ‘Sprouts Trying To Give Them Away. No One Biting’
URL: https://brobible.com/culture/article/whole-foods-vital-farms-eggs-controversy/
Time Published: 2026-01-28T03:00:19Z
Full Content:
Via iStockphoto / @gturek TikTok U.S. consumers are familiar with grocery item phrasing that can be misleading. Many products on the shelf are marketed in ways that don’t always reflect what they actually are. For example, wording such as “natural” or “superfood” isn’t defined or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), giving food manufacturers the liberty to use them as they wish. Still, when a product that has been a staple in customers’ homes for years comes under fire for potentially misrepresenting itself, people are going to be upset. That’s what’s been happening recently with Vital Farms eggs. In a recent TikTok video that has garnered over 434,600 views, creator Gabriel (@gturek) pointed out how Whole Foods is stocking Vital Farms eggs. As he walks towards the egg section, he shows an open-air refrigerator full of Vital Farms eggs in the middle of the floor. Meanwhile, the store placed other brands in other fridges along the perimeter. “Whole Foods got Vital Farms in their own enclosure now smh,” Gabriel wrote in the video’s caption. He added in the caption, “Vital Farms is on timeout.” It all started when Nourish Food Club, a company that sells products like eggs, baked goods, meats, dairy, and cheeses marketed as “cleaner” alternatives, published results from an egg test. According to a YouTube video posted recently, they sent three eggs to be tested for their linoleic acid content. They included one from Nourish Food Club, another from organic Vital Farms, and a third from a cage-free line sold by Meijer. The results, the company claims, showed that Vital Farms contained 3.67 grams of linoleic acid per 100 grams. Nourish Food Club eggs, on the other hand, contained 0.87 grams, and Meijer eggs contained 3.57 grams per 100 grams. Users online quickly started reposting the results, criticizing Vital Farms. The initial controversy seems to have started with a video by creator Zephyr Zoidis, founder of the Localize Food app. As his video and others like it went viral, they brought a significant number of negative comments to the company’s social media accounts, primarily concerning what they feed their chickens. After the backlash, the company shared a TikTok video in which they explained that their hens, while raised in pastures as the packaging claims, are supplemented with corn and soybean meal. UPDATE: In an email correspondence with BroBible, a Vital Farms spokesperson provided material addressing customers’ questions. “We take transparency seriously, and we believe our stakeholders should always know where their food comes from,” they wrote. “When claims suggest we’re misleading the public, we show up with the facts. This week, we’ve seen some misleading headlines and comments about Linoleic Acid in our eggs and what we feed our hens, so we posted content on our social channels and blog to set the record straight.” Vital Farms shared responses to the main questions customers are asking at this link. Under Gabriel’s TikTok video, users expressed frustration at the corporations behind the business. “Dude Amazon OWNS Whole Foods and vital farms,” wrote one user. “Idk why people are surprised. It’s a dirty company who’s only goal is to make money. They know people who want healthy food will spend more, then they gut the company and turn it into a profit farm.” “I loose taste buds when I find out something is owned by blackrock,” wrote another. A correction is needed for these comments, as Amazon does not own Vital Farms, nor does BlackRock. It’s a public company where Amazon holds 3.42% of its shares, and BlackRock 6.60%. “Sprouts trying to give them away,” said a third, sharing a photo of the eggs discounted for $1.99 from $8.99. “No one biting.” “Let’s boycott more bad companies,” another wrote. Linoleic acid is an essential omega-6 fatty acid, and when consumed in moderate amounts, supports human health. When consumed in large amounts, however, some studies have found it may be associated with an increased risk of chronic conditions. These include cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s onset, cancer, dementia, obesity, and diabetes. According to a Harvard Health Publishing report, experts recommend that 5% to 10% of your daily diet should consist of omega-6. If your daily diet consists of 2000 calories, for example, that would be 11 to 22 grams. Currently, though, Americans tend to consume 10 times more omega-6 than omega-3 fats. This is largely due to food manufacturers using oils rich in omega-6, such as sunflower oil and soybean oil. Ultimately, research suggests that the issue has less to do with eggs. Rather, it’s the prevalence of ultra-processed food products or frequent meals outside of the home. To steer away from unhealthy levels of omega-6, nutrition experts recommend keeping the pantry full of fresh, whole foods. #VitalFarms is on timeout ♬ suono originale – Luunaaa BroBible has reached out to Nourish Food Club and Whole Foods via email for comment. We’ve also contacted Gabriel via TikTok messages.

The Trump administrationâs actions â threats to annex Greenland, military intervention in Venezuela and renewed attacks on the Federal Reserveâs independence â have unsettled markets in recent weeks. The US leader has also threatened to hike tariffs on South Korean goods and to impose 100 per cent levies on Canada if Ottawa reaches a trade deal with China. Meanwhile, bond traders are ramping up bets on a dovish policy shift at the Fed on expectations that BlackRock chief investment officer Rick Rieder will succeed Mr Jerome Powell as chair. The Wall Street veteran has advocated for an aggressive approach to lower borrowing costs. A lower rate environment benefits precious metals, which do not pay interest. Expectations of a more dovish and less independent Fed, as well as geopolitical risks, âare likely driving more rapid allocations to gold, led by retail investorsâ, Ms Suki Cooper, global head of commodities research at Standard Chartered, said in a note. âBarring short-term corrections, we continue to see further upside risk.â BLOOMBERG Commodity market Donald Trump US dollar E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Amazon Layoffs: Tech giant Amazon on Tuesday mistakenly sent a notice to some employees, confirming a wave of upcoming layoffs at the company. Employees in the company's cloud division received an internal email acknowledging “organizational changes” at Amazon, according to a report by CNBC. The notice appeared to have been sent prematurely to Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees, a day before the next round of Amazon layoffs, part of the e-commerce giant's plan to cut 30,000 jobs, was scheduled to begin on Wednesday morning, as per Reuters. “Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrote in the email, seen by CNBC. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success," it added. The email also mentions a post from Amazon’s HR boss Beth Galetti, saying that the company had already notified “impacted colleagues in our organization,” in the US, Canada and Costa Rica that they had lost their jobs. According to Reuters, AWS employees who received the email said in their Slack messages that the meeting called for Wednesday was almost immediately cancelled. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” the email further read, as per Reuters. Reuters earlier reported that Amazon intended to lay off thousands of corporate employees starting this week. However, the Andy Jassy-led company has not yet informed impacted workers, nor has it confirmed the news. Jobs in the company's units covering AWS, retail, Prime Video and human resources were slated to be affected, Reuters reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. The full scope of Amazon's layoffs this week remained unclear. Amazon laid off about 14,000 people in October as part of a broader plan to reduce corporate staff by around 30,000, people familiar with the matter said at the time. On Tuesday, Amazon cut jobs in its Fresh grocery and Go market divisions as it plans to close existing brick-and-mortar stores and convert some of them to Whole Foods stores. It did not disclose the number of affected employees. The size of the cuts to be announced on Wednesday remained unclear. The full 30,000 jobs flagged in October would represent a small portion of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the company's corporate workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were meant to reduce management layers and bureaucracy inside the company.

Gold steadied after seven days of gains, with traders digesting a record-breaking rally fueled by US dollar weakness and a flight from sovereign bonds and currencies. Bullion was near $5,160 an ounce, having risen 3.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since April. President Donald Trump said he was not concerned about a drop in the value of the dollar that has dragged the world's premier reserve currency to its weakest level in nearly four years.

Gold has gained nearly 20% since the beginning of the year, smashing through $5,000 an ounce for the first time this week before advancing to a record of $5,190.41. In the same period, silver has surged more than 50%. A massive selloff in the Japanese bond market is the latest example of concerns over heavy fiscal spending, while speculation that the US may intervene to support the yen has weighed on the dollar, making precious metals cheaper for most buyers. A gauge of the US currency fell 1.1% on Tuesday, its biggest one-day drop since April. Trump told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday that the dollar was "doing great" and he expected currency values to fluctuate. "No, I think it's great," he told reporters when asked if he was worried about losses in the currency. Photo Credit: Bloomberg The Trump administration's actions - threats to annex Greenland and military intervention in Venezuela, as well as renewed attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence - have also unsettled markets in recent weeks. The US leader has threatened to hike tariffs on South Korean goods and to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa reaches a trade deal with China. Meanwhile, bond traders are ramping up bets on a dovish policy shift at the Fed on the expectation that BlackRock Inc. Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder will succeed Jerome Powell as chair. The Wall Street veteran has advocated for an aggressive approach to lower borrowing costs. A lower rate environment benefits precious metals, which don't pay interest. Expectations of a more dovish and less independent Fed, as well as geopolitical risks, "are likely driving more rapid allocations to gold, led by retail investors," Suki Cooper, global head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Plc, said in a note. "Barring short-term corrections, we continue to see further upside risk." Gold edged down 0.4% to $5,161.36 an ounce as of 8:21 a.m. in Singapore. Silver rose 0.3% to $112.34. Platinum and palladium fell, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was up 0.2% on Wednesday but down 1.4% for the week.

Title: Some Amazon employees get 'Project Dawn' calendar invitation discussing upcoming job cuts
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-staff-calendar-invitation-upcoming-job-cuts-project-dawn-2026-1
Time Published: 2026-01-28T01:10:26Z
Full Content:
Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days. The invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned "Project Dawn," an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider. The invitation had the subject line "Send Project Dawn email" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant. The invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider. "This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the accompanying message read. "The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed." "Changes like this are hard on everyone," Aubrey's message continued. "These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success." Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. After the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated. "Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?" one employee wrote. Others saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent. "Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it," one person wrote. "Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today." It remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut. "People are speculating you're safe if invited," one employee said. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at ekim@businessinsider.com or Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at 650-942-3061.

A former Wall Street executive pleaded guilty on Tuesday to luring women to New York so he could drug and sexually assault them, including at his Central Park South apartment. He also pleaded guilty to included receipt of child pornography.Edward Gene Smith, 50, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to four counts, including distributing a controlled substance with the intent to commit rape. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 80 years. Smith, a Harvard graduate, was working as a managing director at Citi until around the time of his initial arrest in July 2024 on child pornography charges, court documents show. Prior to joining Citi in 2021, Smith was a managing director at BlackRock, according to LinkedIn and court records. Smith's attorney did not immediately comment when contacted by Business Insider. "We moved to terminate Mr. Smith immediately upon learning about law enforcement's initial investigation, well before the allegations of this depraved behavior came to light," a Citi spokesperson said. "We will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as they seek justice for the victims of these heinous crimes." A superseding indictment filed in December 2025 said he met a woman they called Victim-1 in 2020 over the internet. He paid her to spend time with him, including traveling to Florida to engage in sexual activity. In 2023, according to the indictment, Smith drugged her without her consent and raped her in his Central Park South apartment. Prosecutors say he recorded the assault while the victim was unconscious and later shared the video on an encrypted app. "I don't get a chance to do this every day, lol," the feds said Smith wrote of the encounter. The indictment says Smith met a second women over the internet in 2019, when she was a college student, and paid her to relocate to New York City from the Midwest so they could spend more time together. After she moved, he controlled her finances and social life and repeatedly drugged and raped her, the indictment said. Nicholas Biase, spokesman for the Manhattan US Attorney's Office, said the feds' investigation into Smith is "ongoing." Biase asked that people who may have been victimized by Smith or have knowledge of his alleged crimes contact the FBI. His sentencing is scheduled for May 8. If you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-4673) or visit its website to receive confidential support. Jump to

Pinterest plans to lay off under 15% of its workforce, as part of broader restructuring that arrives as the image-sharing platform pivots more of its money to artificial intelligence. In a Tuesday securities filing, San Francisco-based Pinterest said it was making these cuts to support “transformation initiatives” — which include reallocating the company's resources to AI-focused roles and prioritizing AI-powered products. It said it was also working to reshape its “sales and go-to-market approach.” Beyond the coming layoffs, Pinterest said it will reduce office space. The company expects to complete its restructuring plan by the end of September, incurring pretax charges of $35 million to $45 million. Pinterest's job cuts are expected to impact hundreds of workers. As of the end of last year, Pinterest had a total headcount of about 5,200 employees, the company confirmed to The Associated Press. Like other tech and social media companies, Pinterest has accelerated its integration of AI recently, particularly in consumer-facing offerings. In October, the company introduced AI-powered updates to users' in-platform “boards” and unveiled Pinterest Assistant, which is also powered by AI and gives users shopping recommendations. Pinterest isn't the first company to turn to job cuts while pivoting spending to AI. Last fall, Amazon, for example, said it would cut about 14,000 corporate jobs (close to 4% of its workforce) as it ramped up AI investments while trimming costs elsewhere. Shares of Pinterest fell more than 9% as of midday trading Tuesday. Learn how to buy a home in Japan, including market trends, property buying procedures, and financing.

Title: 12 Signposts That Indicate That A Monumental Economic Meltdown Is Now Upon Us

Time Published: 2026-01-27T20:57:14Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? We live at a time when the pace of change is so rapid that it can be overwhelming at times. More change occurs in a single month than happened during most entire years when I was growing up. When I pull up the news each day, there is always a fresh serving of chaos awaiting me. Unfortunately, chaos is not good for the economy. The U.S. dollar is in the process of dying, debt levels are exploding all around us, more mass layoffs have been announced within the past 24 hours, and the cost of living crisis is absolutely crushing most Americans. Those that can look at the information that I am about to share with you and say “everything is fine” are simply not being rational. The following are 12 signposts that indicate that a monumental economic meltdown is now upon us… #1 Consumer confidence just fell to the lowest level that we have seen in 12 years… America’s economic mood deteriorated in January to its lowest level in more than a decade as consumers fretted about geopolitical tensions, affordability and President Donald Trump’s unrelenting trade war. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index for January, released Tuesday, declined 9.7 points to a reading of 84.5, the lowest since 2014, surpassing the lows of last year when Trump unveiled stiff tariffs and the depths of the pandemic recession in 2020. January’s reading came in much lower than the 91.1 reading economists projected in a poll by data firm FactSet. #2 One recent survey discovered that 56 percent of U.S. workers are experiencing serious financial strain… Social media is rife with tearful videos of how hard it has become to make ends meet. Some 14% of workers can’t or struggle to pay their bills each month, PwC found. Another 42% pay their bills with little or nothing left over for savings. PwC says that’s more than half of the workforce experiencing financial strain in 2025. “I have to work 40 hours a week just so I can have a place to live,” one woman said in one Instagram post. “Forty hours a week makes me $2000 a month and my rent is $1,660. So I work 40 hours a week so I can have a two-bedroom apartment and an extra $300 a month. Like, that doesn’t even cover my phone, internet, food.” #3 According to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity, the percentage of the U.S. workforce that is “functionally unemployed” has risen to a whopping 25.2 percent… Employment researchers are warning that the share of Americans who are only loosely attached to the labor force is on the rise, and that the true rate of unemployment may be far higher than official figures suggest. According to a new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), 25.2 percent of the U.S. workforce could now be classified as “functionally unemployed”—meaning jobless, seeking but unable to secure full-time employment or earning “poverty-level wages.” #4 It is being reported that 1,500 HR employees that work for Amazon are facing the axe… Amazon is expected to cut more jobs within its human resources team by a significant margin. According to Fortune, the e-commerce giant is preparing to lay off approximately 15% of its HR department — equivalent to around 1,500 of the 10,000 HR employees. It is currently unknown when the layoffs will take place, and how many jobs in the Puget Sound region are at risk. #5 At one time, Pinterest was flying high. But now harder times are here and it intends to fire close to 15 percent of its entire workforce… Pinterest said Tuesday it plans to lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as the company embraces artificial intelligence. In a securities filing, Pinterest said it expects the cuts will be complete by the end of its third quarter in late September. Shares of Pinterest slid more than 9%. #6 Nike just announced that it will be eliminating 775 jobs… Nike is planning to cut nearly 800 jobs amid an automation push at the footwear and apparel giant’s distribution centers. The company is cutting 775 jobs that will primarily impact jobs at the retailer’s distribution centers in Tennessee and Mississippi as the company looks to automate more of its supply chain. The news was first reported by CNBC, citing people familiar with the matter. #7 Not to be outdone by any of the companies mentioned above, UPS plans to throw up to 30,000 employees into the streets this year… United Parcel Service plans to cut up to 30,000 workers this year as it moves to cut costs, the delivery giant’s chief financial officer said Tuesday. “In terms of semi-variable costs, we expect to reduce operational positions by up to 30,000,” UPS CFO Brian Dykes said during a company earnings call. “This will be accomplished through attrition, and we expect to offer a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers.” #8 The Washington Post is preparing for “big layoffs”, and that could include the entire sports department… The Washington Post has been around for nearly 150 years and had a sports section for almost as long. But after years and years of declining revenue, it appears that big layoffs are coming – and the sports section could be gutted hardest of all. According to Dylan Byers of Puck, “massive layoffs” are set to hit The Washington Post in the days to come with the foreign desk being hit hard. However, Byers noted that the sports desk is rumored to be getting “shuttered entirely.” #9 The largest mall in San Francisco has been permanently closed even sooner than expected… San Francisco’s beleaguered Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping mall closed its doors earlier than expected. The city’s largest mall, which saw a string of retailers leave in recent months, closed on Saturday, two days ahead of schedule, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. A sign reading “closed until further notice” was posted at the front entrance of the once-bustling shopping center, the outlet reported. #10 Pending home sales in the United States just fell “to the lowest level for any December on record”… Pending home sales, which track the number of contracts signed in December, plunged by 9.3% seasonally adjusted from November, to the lowest level for any December on record in the data by the National Association of Realtors, which goes back to 2010. Compared to December 2010, during the Housing Bust, pending sales were down by 21.5%. The market is now well into its fourth year of the collapse in transactions, and there has simply been no improvement. #11 The U.S. dollar just declined for a fourth consecutive day, and it is now at the lowest level that we have seen in four months… The U.S. ⁠dollar fell for a fourth straight day on Tuesday, slipping to a four-month low, as traders kept watch for possible coordinated currency intervention by U.S. and Japanese authorities and a ‍Federal Reserve interest rate decision. #12 If someone tries to convince you that the U.S. dollar is not dying, just show them this chart… When the value of the U.S. dollar declines, the purchasing power of our money goes down. Meanwhile, the price of silver is currently sitting at 110 dollars an ounce. Many of us have been warning that all of this was coming, and now it is happening right in front of our eyes. Our leaders have been making very bad decisions for decades, and now we are paying the price. But if you think that things are bad now, just hold on tight, because things are going to get even more chaotic in the months ahead.

Title: Modern Gamers Won’t Experience One of Gaming’s Worst Trends, But They Face Something Worse

By Tom Wilson As gaming has evolved, many of the frustrating woes that plagued players have largely disappeared. From frustrating tank controls to restrictive gameplay mechanics, there are a lot of minor and major issues that those gaming today may never even experience. With so many of them in our proverbial rearview mirrors, one would be forgiven for thinking that there’s little wrong with the state of video games today. Of course, that’s a ridiculous notion, owing to the many, many, many problems with the industry, layoffs, monetization methods, and more. Fortunately, despite all of that, we’ve managed to quash one of gaming’s worst trends, the scarcity of media. The era of being unable to find your favorite game in your local store, or, indeed, having missed out on it the first time around and needing to fork over hundreds of dollars as the price of old media continues to rise, is over. Yet, despite that, there’s still one problem gamers face today that is arguably worse. Players may no longer need to worry about getting their hands on a physical or digital copy of a game, but they do need to worry about said games going completely extinct and becoming unplayable. When I was a child, I remember walking into my local secondhand game store looking for Final Fantasy X. Alas, all I could see was Final Fantasy X-2. I assumed it must have been a deluxe edition of the game (the 2 in the name should perhaps have been a clue it was a sequel), so I picked it up and muddled my way through a somewhat confusing experience. The likes of Steam or even mainstream online buying weren’t quite as popular as they are now, and the preservation of media through digital content or mass production wasn’t in full swing. If you wanted to buy a game, you had to go out and find it, and if it wasn’t there, you just couldn’t get it. Nowadays, gaming is such a widespread hobby that video games are produced on a far greater scale physically and are available on more digital platforms than ever before. Much has been said about Xbox’s move to ditch console exclusivity, but even that notion shows just how far we’ve come in making the hobby more accessible to a wider pool of people. You don’t need to settle for whatever your local store has on offer (although I still recommend supporting them whenever possible), as Steam holds over 100,000 games, and thousands of others are available on other digital storefronts. If you want to buy a game nowadays, you just go online and find it, whether it’s on Amazon or otherwise. This is all fairly common knowledge at this point, but something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. The preservation of art and media is so incredibly important, and that’s easier than ever thanks to this shift in production and distribution. The death of scarcity, while perhaps leading to choice paralysis, does mean that games like Final Fantasy X are a mere click away now. However, a new problem has taken its place, one that is actually far worse, despite the significant strides taken to stop things like it from happening in the first place. The live service genre has its fair share of issues that have been well documented online. However, by far the biggest issue with live service games is their longevity, or rather, their lack of it. Live service games are designed to be inherently disposable, the lifespan of the servers hosting them tied to the amount of money coming in and consequently the player base supporting them. Essentially, once that player count drops or the publisher decides it isn’t worth supporting the game anymore, the live service game is removed from existence. It isn’t just taken offline and left for players to enjoy as a single-player experience. This is the case occasionally, such as with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (which is quickly reaching its impending doom), but more often, live service games are just rendered unplayable once their servers are taken offline. Entire games that had millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars poured into them, teams of dedicated artists crafting them, and loyal fans who enjoy playing them are removed from existence. No other artform, beyond publicity stunts or socio-political statements, has had entire works deleted simply because they’re no longer supported. Of course, there have been films lost to time due to the corrosion of the literal material they’re shot upon, or because they didn’t get enough widespread distribution at the time (much like video games 20 years ago). However, beyond that, if a film comes out in cinemas, or a work of art is displayed in a museum, or a book is published, you can find it, physically or otherwise, one way or another. Even some of the greatest forgotten video games are still accessible thanks to physical copies doing the rounds on secondhand sites like eBay. Live service games are an anomaly in the world of art, and a huge problem for modern gamers who invest time and money into them. In 2025, after six years on the market, EA killed Anthem, the divisive game from the critically acclaimed and beloved studio, BioWare. Honestly, it was devastating, not just because an entire experience was rendered extinct at the press of a button, but because, among all the flaws, there was still a lot of fun to be had with Anthem. It also means that those new to gaming, or those just discovering BioWare’s works, will never get to experience it, warts and all. That’s a huge blow to game preservation, as are the deaths of many other games like it. The loss of live service titles has sparked numerous petitions, including one that came about as a result of Ubisoft shutting down The Crew without implementing some form of offline mode. However, while, in some cases, developers have chosen to add a single-player experience to ensure their games are still playable long after the servers have blinked out of existence, many continue to just pull their games without a thought to preserving their legacy. One can hope that, like video game scarcity, it will be a problem that is eventually solved. The integration of offline modes or a move away from this type of experience altogether would be hugely beneficial, but perhaps unreasonable. Whereas video game scarcity was solved merely by the increase in popularity of the medium and technological innovation, the death of live service games must be fixed at a publisher and developer level. Servers cannot be left online indefinitely, so offline modes must be prioritized, and they don’t come free. I sincerely hope that future gamers won’t have this issue and will write articles about how we all suffered through it. What do you think?

Title: A Meta deal just turned this 175-year-old company into a linchpin of the AI data center boom

You might know Corning for its iconic kitchen brands, like Pyrex and CorningWare. You might remember that Thomas Edison relied on the company to develop glass for the light bulb, or that in 1970, Corning invented the first glass fiber that was useful for long-distance communication, while in 2007 Steve Jobs turned to Corning, which is based in Corning, N.Y., to create the hard-to-shatter glass that now wraps every iPhone. You probably don’t think of it as an AI company, but a new deal with Meta shows how radically the AI boom is reshaping America’s industrial landscape. The 175-year-old Corning, a longtime fixture of the Fortune 500, has reinvented itself once again—this time as a critical supplier to the world’s largest AI data centers. Meta announced today that it has committed to paying Corning up to $6 billion through 2030 for fiber-optic cable to wire its expanding fleet of AI data centers. In a CNBC interview, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks disclosed that Corning is expanding a North Carolina manufacturing facility to accommodate growing demand from Meta and other companies including Nvidia, OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. When the project is complete—with funding from Meta—Corning says it will be the largest fiber-optic cable plant in the world. The news today sent Corning’s stock soaring 16%. Instead of sending information as electrical signals through copper wire, fiber uses strands of ultra-pure glass—each one thinner than a human hair—to carry data as pulses of light. In AI data centers, fiber-optic cable links tens of thousands of GPUs, allowing them to function as a single supercomputer cluster. Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, told Fortune the Meta deal is “big” for Corning, likely doubling its annual revenue from that one deal alone from under a half-billion to closer to a billion per year once the plant is fully ramped up. The deal also likely won’t be the last one for Corning, as hyperscalers look to lock in supply. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see Microsoft do a similar Corning deal, because a lot of these data center investors are moving past plant construction, and they really fear that shortages are going to show up once they get to that next stage,” Boloor said. As my colleague Kristin Stoller reported in Fortune last year, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for Corning. In the 1990s, Weeks was a Corning vice president tapped to run a new optical fiber business to power the burgeoning internet—an innovation that drove Corning’s valuation to nearly $100 billion at the height of the internet bubble in 2000. That bubble burst the following year, sending the company’s stock price plummeting from some $100 to $1. But even when Corning lost 99% of its value and had to lay off half its employees, Weeks continued to develop the company’s fiber tech, which is continuing to pay off during the AI data center boom. Over the past six months, Corning’s stock has risen over 100%. The Meta deal comes at a moment when power has become the biggest bottleneck for hyperscalers, said Boloor, pushing companies to do everything they can to work around a constraint that is only getting worse. Today’s AI data centers pack racks of GPUs that must be physically connected at what he calls “insane speeds.” “Electricity does not move through air, and data does not teleport between racks—the power flows through copper, and the data flows through fiber,” he explained. As AI inference—the day-to-day output of models—booms, the “amount of fiber per data center is going to explode.”

A State apology is to be given by the Taoiseach to people who suffered abuse in industrial and reformatory schools. The Government has agreed a package of additional supports for survivors of abuse at institutional schools, including health, education, housing and funeral cost supports. In November, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and then-education minister Helen McEntee met with survivors who were on hunger strike outside Leinster House over a lack of support from the Government. A commitment was given to the group and a mediator has been working through their concerns. The Taoiseach indicated that he would give a formal apology to survivors in the Dáil on behalf of the Government and in consultation with Attorney General Rossa Fanning. Source: PA © RTÉ 2026.

Title: This Is When Elon Musk’s Humanoid Robots Are Expected to Release

By Evolve Editors Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a high-profile appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to share a bold update on the future of labor. During a discussion with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Thursday, January 22, Musk revealed that the company is aiming to make its Optimus humanoid robots available for public sale by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, this timeline marks a significant milestone for the project, which the businessman believes will eventually become the most valuable product in Tesla’s portfolio. Elon Musk revealed that Tesla has already deployed approximately 1,200 Optimus units across its Giga Texas facility to perform basic logistics and assembly tasks. By the end of this year, he expects them to master significantly more complex industrial maneuvers. However, the most striking reveal was the 2027 public release window. Musk explained that once the technology reaches a threshold of “very high reliability and safety,” it will be ready for the general population. He framed the project as a solution to global labor shortages, particularly in elder care and household management. “By the end of next year, I think we’ll be selling humanoid robots to the public. That’s when we’re confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you’d like,” he stated during the panel (via Fox Business). Despite this optimism, the 54-year-old offered a reality check regarding the “agonizingly slow” initial production ramp, which he described as an “S-curve.” Because almost every component in Optimus is entirely new, reaching mass scale remains a massive engineering hurdle. Nevertheless, Elon Musk maintained his vision of a future in which robots outnumber humans, predicting an “explosion in the global economy” that will eventually satisfy all human needs through unprecedented abundance.

Title: Meta's soaring capex is front and center for analysts ahead of the social media giant's Q4 earnings

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the case for his company's continued AI expansion — and its need to continue scaling infrastructure — after Meta's fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday included a revenue beat but higher-than-expected capital spending. The company delivered $59.89 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of last year, beating Wall Street's estimate of $58.41 billion. Earnings per share came in at $8.88 versus expectations of $8.19. The stock was up over 8% in after-hours trading. On capex, Meta said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in 2026, compared to estimates for $110.62 billion. On the call with analysts, Zuckerberg said Meta was a "deep technology company" that should pursue its own frontier model rather than rely on others' APIs. As for the superintelligence lab, Zuckerberg gave the "unfulfilling" answer that he was optimistic about the future. Ultimately, ads are still the center of Meta's business — and Zuckerberg acknowledged it. One analyst asked whether Meta can "do things beyond ads." Zuckerberg said yes, but that ads will continue to be Meta's "driver of growth" for the next couple of years. Catch up on the play-by-play from Meta's Q4 earnings call with analysts below: In her final response, Li says that Meta AI is popular where Meta's apps are popular. In India and Indonesia, Meta AI engagement is driven by WhatsApp, whereas in the US, it is driven by Facebook. "We see a lot of opportunity to make it easier for people to accomplish the tasks that they already come to our services for every day," Li says. Does Meta need a general-purpose model? The space is crowded, from OpenAI to Anthropic to xAI. Zuckerberg says Meta is a "deep technology" company — more than just the apps for which it's known. He said he thinks that frontier models will not always be available via an API in the future. That means it's important for Meta to have its own frontier model, Zuckerberg says.

"We're clearly extremely focused on this," he says. Ross Sandler of Barclays asks about Meta's plan for Horizon Worlds. Zuckerberg responds that in the future, there will be lots of "interactive and immersive content." He imagines a future where people can easily create a game with a prompt and then jump into it. Users would also be able to share these AI-generated games on their feed, Zuckerberg says, so their friends can enter them, too. Ross Sandler of Barclays asks about Meta's plan for Horizon Worlds.

Users would also be able to share these AI-generated games on their feed, Zuckerberg says, so their friends can enter them, too. Last quarter, the word "metaverse" was not uttered on Meta's earnings call. Meta's ads business is still doing most of the heavy lifting, and Zuckerberg isn't pretending otherwise. On the earnings call, Bank of America analyst Justin Post pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can "do things beyond ads." Zuckerberg said yes, Meta is focused on building new businesses, but stressed that "for the next couple of years, ads are going to be our driver of growth." Meta's ads business is still doing most of the heavy lifting, and Zuckerberg isn't pretending otherwise. On the earnings call, Bank of America analyst Justin Post pressed Zuckerberg on whether Meta can "do things beyond ads." Zuckerberg said yes, Meta is focused on building new businesses, but stressed that "for the next couple of years, ads are going to be our driver of growth." He framed it as a balancing act. Meta wants to pursue new revenue streams, while also "investing very heavily" to ensure its AI work improves both the quality of its apps and the performance of its core ad business. Zuckerberg added that even if new initiatives scale quickly, they'll still take time to matter at the size of Meta's ads engine. Meta's claims of capacity constraints don't seem to square with its plans to start leasing out data center space. Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs pointed out the contradiction, and Susan Li answered: "We expect over the course of 2026 to have significantly more capacity this year as we add cloud, but we'll likely still be constrained through much of 2026 until additional capacity from our own facilities comes online later in the year." It's an "unfulfilling time" to talk about Meta's Superintelligence Labs, Zuckerberg says. It's a "long-term effort," which Meta is about six months into, Zuckerberg says. "I'm quite optimistic," he says. There is a "big delta" between those who use agents and those who don't, Zuckerberg says. Agents can make employees "significantly more productive," he says. Zuckerberg hopes that the company can use AI to "get a lot more done." Meta is still capacity-constrained, Li says. Demands for compute and resources have increased "even faster" than supply. Li expects that Meta will remain constrained until additional capacity from its own facilities becomes available later in the year. Li says that "legal and regulatory headwinds" in the EU and US could affect the business. She points to scrutiny over "youth-related issues." There are trials scheduled for this year in the US, which may result in a "material loss," Li says. Meta finished 2025 with the high-profile acquisition of Manus, an agentic AI startup based in Singapore but with roots in China. Regulators in China said this month that they would review the deal. That could cause a headache for Meta, which says it plans to integrate Manus' technology into its existing platforms, at a time when it's looking for a boost in the AI race. Zuckerberg says that connecting recommendations and LLMs will improve the advertising experience. There will be opportunities around Meta AI, Zuckerberg says. He is excited about movements in "shopping in commerce," as well as advances to Meta's models. Zuckerberg says that connecting recommendations and LLMs will improve the advertising experience. There will be opportunities around Meta AI, Zuckerberg says. He is excited about movements in "shopping in commerce," as well as advances to Meta's models. Zuckerberg points to the Manus acquisition. Businesses already pay Manus to use their tools, he says. Now, Meta can incorporate those tools. Meta wants "long-term flexibility" as it spends significantly on infrastructure. The company is changing how it develops data center sites and establishing new ownership structures for some large data centers, Li says. Meta will have sufficient cash to fund its 2026 infrastructure bets, Li says. Meta continues to roll out its AI business assistant. More advertisers will be able to chat with the assistant in the coming months, Li says. AI can also help advertisers on the creative side. The combined revenue run rate of its video generation tool hit $10 billion in Q4, Li says. Zuckerberg is pitching 2026 as a turning point for how work gets done inside Meta, and he's explicitly tying it to a leaner org. On the company's earnings call, he said Meta is "investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done." Zuckerberg is pitching 2026 as a turning point for how work gets done inside Meta, and he's explicitly tying it to a leaner org. On the company's earnings call, he said Meta is "investing in AI native tooling so individuals at Meta can get more done." He said Meta is already seeing "projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person." Worth noting: While Meta ended 2025 with 78,865 employees (up 6% from the same time last year), the company has said this growth is concentrated in technical hires for priority areas like its AI push. In other words, Meta is betting that fewer elite engineers, armed with new AI tools, can do more with less. Meta is in "early testing" for its AI personalization effort, Li says. It is investing heavily in new architecture for its recommendation system, building "on top of LLMs." Its AI translation tool is also going strong, dubbing mobile videos into nine different languages. AI-translated videos have hundreds of millions of views, Li says. Zuckerberg said Meta will dive into "agentic shopping" across its apps. "Today, our systems help people stay in touch with friends," Zuckerberg said. "But soon we'll be able to understand people's unique personal goals and tailor feeds to show each person content that helps them improve their lives in the ways that they want."

"But soon we'll be able to understand people's unique personal goals and tailor feeds to show each person content that helps them improve their lives in the ways that they want." Meta's agentic commerce tools "will allow people to find just the right, very specific, set of products from the businesses in our catalog," Zuckerberg said. AI-powered agentic commerce has been a hot topic in Silicon Valley. Google is an unsurprising player in the space, while platforms like Pinterest are also building out more AI shopping tools. In-app shopping was previously a big focus for Meta-owned Instagram, but the platform sidelined some of its initiatives, including sunsetting its dedicated shopping tab. Meta blew past analyst expectations for full-year capex, coming in at $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the full year. Wall Street shouldn't be surprised capex was higher than expected. Meta's spending has crept up and up and up in the last year as it shells out on data centers.

Wall Street shouldn't be surprised capex was higher than expected. Meta's spending has crept up and up and up in the last year as it shells out on data centers. The company expects 2026 capex to range from $115 billion to $135 billion. Meta ended the fourth quarter with 78,800 employees, up 6% year-over-year, CFO Susan Li says. The head count increase was driven by hiring in "priority areas" including monetization, infrastructure, and Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2026 will be "the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work," Zuckerberg says. Zuckerberg plans to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams at Meta. A "single, very talented person" can now do what a big team used to handle, he says. 2026 will be "the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work," Zuckerberg says.

He compared AI glasses to the rise of smartphones, emerging out of flip phones. Zuckerberg expects an "explosion of new media formats" thanks to AI. Our feeds will be more "interactive."

He expects that the first models will be "good," but that Meta will push the frontier as it rolls out more models throughout 2026. Meta's Reality Labs division, the unit responsible for its virtual and augmented reality efforts, remains a massive financial drain. It lost over $6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025 and a staggering $19.19 billion over the year. Earlier this month, Meta cut roughly 1,500 Reality Labs employees — about 10% of the division's workforce — and shuttered several VR gaming studios that it had acquired. Meta plans to deprioritize VR in favor of AI-powered wearables such as smart glasses. In a recent interview, Meta's chief technology officer and Reality Labs head, Andrew Bosworth, acknowledged that VR is "growing less quickly than we hoped."

Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in the earnings report that the company expects 2026 Reality Labs operating losses to remain "similar to 2025 levels." It's all happening. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are on the call and will begin with reading prepared remarks. Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, highlighted the gap between Meta's business performance and market expectations about AI spending. "While Meta's strong ad growth demonstrates the core business remains healthy, investors are clearly signaling concerns that its aggressive AI spending may pressure profitability," Cohen said.

"While Meta's strong ad growth demonstrates the core business remains healthy, investors are clearly signaling concerns that its aggressive AI spending may pressure profitability," Cohen said. Meta's ad impressions and average price-per-ad were both up year-over-year for 2025, at 12% and 9%, respectively. Meta's 2026 free cash flow could be squeezed as the company pours more money into AI infrastructure, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. He estimated capital spending could run at 45% to 55% of revenue, which he called the highest "capital-outlay intensity" among the major hyperscalers. Singh added that the pressure is exacerbated because Reality Labs' recent cuts have been relatively modest: about 10% (roughly $2 billion), rather than the 30% some investors had expected.

There are also questions about how quickly Meta can turn its AI investment into revenue. Singh said that Meta AI's stand-alone app, as well as its Vibes AI-video feed, still trails ChatGPT and Gemini on the consumer side. In Meta's CFO outlook, the company said it expected talent compensation would be the second-largest contributor to expense growth in 2026. It only ranked below infrastructure costs. The compensation growth is driven by "investments in technical talent," including 2026 hires to priority areas like AI, as well as expenses from 2025 hires.

It helped drive a talent war among other leading AI companies — including OpenAI and Anthropic — by offering large paychecks and signing bonuses. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Meta's executives will be keen to emphasize that its ads business still has plenty of room to grow. Some of that will come from Meta harnessing AI to continue to fine-tune its precision ad-targeting models. Advertisers reward performance with bigger budgets. Analysts at Evercore wrote in a January 25 research note that one ad buyer had seen a 4% lift in return on investment from Meta ads last year.

Analysts at Evercore wrote in a January 25 research note that one ad buyer had seen a 4% lift in return on investment from Meta ads last year. Another positive sign for Meta's ad business will be if it continues to increase the surfaces on which it sells ads. Case in point: Last week, Meta said it's rolling out ads on Threads globally to all users. And, as a side note, let's not forget that Meta is a major advertiser in its own right. Meta's back in the Super Bowl next month with two ads showcasing its Meta Oakley AI glasses, which might get a shout-out later on. Meta is in "somewhat of an awkward phase," Raymond James' Josh Beck and other analysts wrote in a note on Monday. They dubbed the company an "AI Tweener" as investors await progress updates on Meta's Llama and its other proprietary AI models. Beck also highlighted AI-powered agentic commerce as an opportunity for Meta. Meta is in "somewhat of an awkward phase," Raymond James' Josh Beck and other analysts wrote in a note on Monday. They dubbed the company an "AI Tweener" as investors await progress updates on Meta's Llama and its other proprietary AI models. Beck also highlighted AI-powered agentic commerce as an opportunity for Meta. With an AI shopping assistant, Meta could leverage Reels and influencers to spark "'inspired shopping' journeys" on its platforms, Beck wrote. At the same time, if other companies move ahead on agentic shopping, that could pose a threat if "consumers flock" elsewhere. Meta's recent cuts in Reality Labs are a late admission that the metaverse was a bad bet, Mike Proulx, Forrester vice president and research director, told Business Insider. By trimming Reality Labs, "Meta can better focus on its AI ambitions, especially as Gemini tries to usurp the personal intelligence space," Proulx said.

By trimming Reality Labs, "Meta can better focus on its AI ambitions, especially as Gemini tries to usurp the personal intelligence space," Proulx said. Proulx also flagged several potential headwinds for 2026, including constraints in businesses where Meta has momentum. Demand for Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses has outpaced supply, making international expansion difficult, he says. He also said that the TikTok deal in the US could keep the pressure on Reels, its closest competitor. "And let's not forget how Meta closed its Q3 earnings call with an ominous warning about regulatory hurdles in 2026 that 'may ultimately result in a material loss,'" Proulx added. One bright spot, according to Proulx? The recent reports that Threads has overtaken Elon Musk's X in daily active mobile users. Google pulled off a mighty turnaround in 2025, culminating in it reaching a $4 trillion market cap this month. The stock is up 72% in the last year. Like Google, Meta has a big distribution advantage thanks to its billions of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook users. So, how is it going to use them in the AI race?

Bernstein's Mark Shmulik wrote in a Tuesday note that one of his key themes for this year is a change in "winner" criteria from model quality to product usage. Good news for Meta, then. Investors will be listening closely for clues about how Zuck and co are going to bring irresistible AI-driven features to Meta's vast empire of users, creators, advertisers, and businesses. "Meta remains one of our top picks for 2026 and could well see a story similar to Google 2025," Shmulik wrote. Investors are in a "holding pattern" to see if Meta's next big AI model is a blockbuster event, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a note on Tuesday. With Meta's next model, codenamed "Avocado," rumored to launch this spring, we'll be listening out for any hints at what it might bring. Meta's family of AI models, known as Llama, has so far received a lukewarm reception, but even if the new offerings aren't enough to put Meta in the leading pack, Shmulik posits it may not be a disaster so long as Meta can pair with another lab for its models.

Rothschild has a $900 price target for Meta stock, one of the highest on Wall Street. Its target represents a 35% increase from levels on Wednesday. Analyst James Cordwell sees Meta as one of the tech sector's best-positioned companies to capitalize on rising AI demand. "The recent focus regarding Meta has been dominated by how the company might guide for FY26 operating expenses and capital expenditure," he stated. "The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost."

Goldman analysts remain focused on Meta's capex plans, which they believe will continue to drive growth into 2026 and beyond. The bank recently raised its spending projections for the company, already above analyst estimates, noting that it sees upward pressure on consensus capex estimates. "On the next earnings call, we expect investors will be focused on any updates on the work of the Meta Superintelligence Lab, the timing of any foundational model work and/or any strategies with respect to consumer or enterprise utility around AI," Goldman analysts stated. Deutsche analysts maintain a buy rating and a bullish price target of $880 for Meta stock, a 31% jump from current levels. But as analyst Benjamin Black notes, heading into the Q4 earnings call, concerns linger about this year's expenses. That said, his team also predicts that Meta's revenue will come in at $59 billion, just above Wall Street estimates.

Title: How One Just Stock Shaved More Than 400 Points Off the Dow on Tuesday

The Dow Jones Industrial Average missed out on a rally today thanks in large part to one very influential stock. The Dow fell 0.8% Tuesday. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively, boosted by rising chip stocks and other AI infrastructure providers. But it wasn’t just roaring AI stocks lifting those indexes: The 30-component Dow was being dragged down Tuesday. A familiar culprit was to blame. Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) tumbled nearly 20%—they lost $69 each—after getting hit with a double whammy. Late Monday, Medicare administrators said payments to private Medicare Advantage plans will barely increase next year; this morning UnitedHealth forecast total revenue will decline this year as it scales back operations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the most widely-followed measures of stock market performance. Its price-weighted methodology makes it an idiosyncratic gauge that can diverge sharply from the other major indexes due to big single-stock moves. UnitedHealth’s slump was bad news for the price-weighted Dow, in which stocks with the highest nominal stock prices have the most impact on the index’s performance. By contrast, the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 and Nasdaq are more influenced by the companies with the largest market values. With a stock price of $351.64 heading into today's trading, UnitedHealth Group was the sixth-most expensive stock in the Dow, and thus the price-weighted index’s sixth-most influential component. In the end, today's drop shaved about 422 points off the index. The Dow wasn’t helped by its most influential component, Goldman Sachs (GS), shares of which slipped 0.2% to about $930. Shares of Home Depot (HD) and American Express (AXP), two other companies with larger Dow weightings than UnitedHealth, both fell more than 1%. Still, UnitedHealth alone pulled the Dow into the red on Tuesday, as its fall led to more lost points—the 422 mentioned above—than the 409 recorded by the index itself. (The Dow's level is calculated by summing the daily price change of the index's 30 stocks and dividing the total by the Dow Divisor.) A similar dynamic played out several times last year, with UnitedHealth’s financial woes occasionally single-handedly tanking one of the most widely-cited gauges of stock market performance. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect closing prices for Tuesday.

Title: UPS will cut 30K more jobs after massive 2025 layoffs as it ends Amazon partnership

United Parcel Service announced Tuesday about 30,000 job cuts this year as the company winds down its partnership with Amazon as part of an intense cost-cutting agenda — and after cutting tens of thousands of jobs just last year. The Atlanta-based delivery giant plans to slash total operational hours by approximately 25 million by reducing its dependence on Amazon, CFO Brian Dykes said during a call with analysts Tuesday. “In terms of variable costs, we expect to reduce operational positions by up to 30,000,” Dykes said. “This will be accomplished through attrition, and we expect to offer a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers.” UPS also said it has identified 24 buildings for closure in the first half of 2026, adding that further closures could come later this year. The company closed 93 buildings last year. The company also plans to “further deploy automation” across its network, Dykes said. UPS slashed a whopping 48,000 jobs last year, including 34,000 operational roles and 14,000 in management. Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise after the company initially estimated a combined 20,000 layoffs over the course of 2025. It’s part of a multiyear turnaround plan under CEO Carol Tomé, who took the helm in 2020, making her the first woman and company outsider to lead UPS. She has faced mounting pressure from investors and employees frustrated by the company’s underperformance and lagging stock price compared to rivals like FedEx and Amazon’s logistics arm. “2025 was a year of considerable progress for UPS as we took action to strengthen our revenue quality and build a more agile network,” Tomé said in a Tuesday statement. “Looking ahead, upon completion of the Amazon glide-down, 2026 will be an inflection point in the execution of our strategy to deliver growth and sustained margin expansion.” Amazon was previously the delivery firm’s largest customer, but the two companies are working to end their joint operations. UPS said it expects $3 billion in total savings from unwinding its business with Amazon. Shares in UPS jumped 3% Tuesday after the company announced the job cuts and released fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations – including adjusted profit of $2.6 billion and $24.5 billion in consolidated revenues.

Title: Washington Post staffers feeling 'betrayed' as turmoil, looming layoffs rock billionaire Jeff Bezos’ newsroom

Former Washington Post face checker Glenn Kessler spoke with Fox News Digital about the paper's "absentee owner" Jeff Bezos and the challenges the news outlet faces. The Washington Post has had a tumultuous few days with only more rockiness on the road ahead as the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper faces an ongoing crisis. Panic at the paper bled onto social media Monday, with staffers sounding the alarm by using the hashtag "#SaveThePost," as reports of major pending layoffs spread in the newsroom. Post leaders have been working for roughly two years to be in a position to break even financially after reported $100 million losses in 2024, and an upcoming headcount reduction is expected to help accomplish that goal. "It’s a tense period," Glenn Kessler, the Post's former fact-checker, told Fox News Digital. "Many have dedicated their professional careers to the Post and are worried an important American institution is being dismantled." WASHINGTON POST STAFFERS PLEAD WITH BILLIONAIRE OWNER JEFF BEZOS TO SAVE THE PAPER AMID MAJOR LOOMING LAYOFFS Billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. (Karwai Tang/WireImage; Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images) The Post's foreign correspondents penned a letter to the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, urging him to preserve their beat as it has emerged as a high target in looming budget cuts. "We are The Washington Post’s international correspondents, writing with a collective plea for you to preserve our newspaper’s global coverage, which we fear will be greatly weakened in coming cuts," they wrote to Bezos. Bezos, who irked Post staffers by ignoring a petition for him to visit the newsroom when he was in town for President Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration, has not offered any recent public comment regarding the paper’s issues. On Monday, as current and former Post journalists begged Bezos to save the paper, he attended the Dior fashion show at the Musée Rodin in Paris, France. His silence has been so frustrating that employees have considered reaching out to celebrities like Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep with the hopes a Hollywood heavyweight could get his attention, according to Status. The two actors starred in "The Post," a 2017 movie about the publication of the Pentagon Papers. The sports section faced a roller coaster of its own after it was initially reported that the Post was forgoing sending any of its journalists to cover the Winter Olympics next month in Italy, a decision that was reversed on Monday following intense blowback. Like the foreign affairs beat, the sports section may also be gutted. "The Washington Post, the paper I grew up reading, is potentially considering shuttering its sports desk entirely amidst layoffs, isn’t sending baseball reporters to spring training, and in general is just going down the tubes," ESPN’s Clinton Yates, who spent nine years at the Post, said Monday on his radio show. EDITORIAL OVERHAUL: WASHINGTON POST'S NEW OPINION CHIEF FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez at the Dior fashion show as part of Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2026 held at the Musée Rodin on Jan. 26, 2025 in Paris, France. (Swan Gallet/WWD via Getty Images) "Shutting down the sports section at the Washington Post is akin to removing a monument as far as I’m concerned," he continued. "And I think a lot of people would agree with me." New York Times reporter Peter Baker believes international and sports coverage are "two of the strongest parts" of the Post. "They have amazing must-read writers. If they are gutted by Bezos's publisher, it would be one of the most self-destructive acts in American journalism in years. Praying it's not true," Baker wrote on X. But prayers might not be enough, as the Post's former media reporter, Paul Farhi, told Fox News Digital that he heard rumors from his former colleagues that "up to 300 people" could be laid off by the next round of cuts. "I was just texting with a friend. She said it was genuinely heartbreaking," Kessler said. "Then I got [a] text from another former colleague, a star reporter. She said it was incredible that she could be laid off." NY POST, WSJ, NY TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST ALIGN AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN OVER ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS Glenn Kessler worked at The Washington Post from 1998 until 2025. (Washington Post) Kessler left the Post last summer after 27 years at the paper, taking a voluntary buyout. His former boss, Washington Post CEO and publisher Will Lewis, called for staffers who don't "feel aligned" with the new direction of the paper to consider taking the buyout. "There were many who wanted to stick with the Post and chose to stay. So they feel especially betrayed — though of course no one knows what’s really happening. Except it sounds bad," Kessler told Fox News Digital. The Post has been plagued by low morale and financial struggles for years, and there has already been a significant exodus of staffers, many of whom have taken positions at rival publications like The New York Times and The Atlantic. Bezos took heat from employees in 2024 when he abruptly axed the paper's planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for the White House, after the editorial board had previously declared Trump the worst president in modern history. The surprising decision shortly before the election sparked massive subscriber losses and a slew of staff resignations. Bezos later fueled more outrage when he announced he was overhauling its editorial pages to promote "free markets and personal liberties."

(Ernesto Ruscio/GC Images) The Amazon founder is fueling outrage once again, with headlines such as "Jeff Bezos Is Putting The Washington Post Into Hospice" popping up across the internet. Bezos is the fourth-richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $250 billion, according to Forbes. Many in the media industry have long wondered why he wouldn’t reach into his pockets in order to save rank-and-file Post employees. "Jeff Bezos’ destruction of a great newspaper will be part of his legacy. #SaveThePost," famed baseball reporter Ken Rosenthal posted Monday on X. "You know what, let’s spend a little less on the boat foam wedding party and keep some f---ing reporters in Tehran," Jon Stewart quipped Monday night on "The Daily Show," referring to Bezos’ extravagant 2025 wedding that cost a reported $50 million. Others have thought it presumptuous that Bezos should continue to shell out money for a company that's losing money. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: This Specialty Glassmaker’s Stock Is Soaring on an AI Data Center Deal With Meta

A deal with Meta Platforms (META) is the latest piece of good news boosting Corning (GLW) stock. Corning and Meta announced $6 billion deal for Corning to supply the Facebook and Instagram parent with fiber optic technology and cables for its AI data centers. Corning said the deal will allow it to expand its manufacturing footprint in North Carolina with a new facility and increases in hiring. Corning shares were up 17% around $111 in Tuesday afternoon trading following the announcement, near their record set during the dot-com bubble of 2000, while Meta shares were down less than 1%. The agreement with Meta marks the latest AI-driven deal for Corning, which makes fiber optic cables used in data centers, and has been a big beneficiary of the AI trade. Corning's stock soared more than 80% last year, following a 50% rise in 2024, thanks in part to a boost from AI-driven business. The company, which is a supplier to tech giants such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), routinely topped estimates and lifted its forecasts in 2025. Wall Street analysts have said they expect Corning's AI exposure and partnership with Apple could also provide more opportunities for future growth, including potentially making the complex glass required for a foldable iPhone. Of the six analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha, five have issued "buy" ratings, compared to one "hold," though the stock has already surpassed their mean target around $100 with its recent gains. Investors could get further insights into Corning's business when the company reports fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens on Wednesday. Meta is also set to release its latest results tomorrow, among a trio of the Magnificent Seven due to report.

Investing Nvidia invested $2B in CoreWeave to accelerate AI data center expansion toward 5GW+ by 2030. Tesla’s European sales fell 27% in 2025 while BYD surged 286.6%. Sending You to Google News in 3 © IPhone 16 series in Apple Store Nagoya Sakae (CC BY-SA 4.0) by Kyu3a Shares of buy now, pay later stock Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM) are gaining attention. All after analysts at Needham upgraded the stock to a buy with a $100 price target. The firm added that, “AFRM has submitted an application to establish Affirm Bank, a proposed Nevada-chartered industrial loan company,” as quoted by CNBC. We have to consider that BNPL is only expected to explode as Americans take on more debt. In doing so, they’re also using loans more than ever before. As noted by MarketWatch, shoppers used BNPL to spend about $20 billion between November 1 and December 31. That’s a 9.8% year over year increase. The global Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) market is experiencing massive growth. It’s projected to reach between $560 billion and over $900 billion in transaction volume by 2030. All are driven by surging e-commerce demand and flexible payment adoption. In the U.S. alone, the market is expected to reach $198 billion in 2026. All of which should help drive BNPL stock, like Affirm, to higher highs. Shares of CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) are up 12%, or by $12.51 on the day. For one, Nvidia just invested $2 billion to expand AI data center capacity. “This deal allows us to accelerate our build, which will lead to continued diversification and reducing dependency on any particular client as we scale into this additional data center capacity,” CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC. Analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded CRWV to a buy rating with a $140 price target on the Nvidia news. The firm added, “It provides CoreWeave three key things: (1) an accelerated path to its newly stated goal of adding 5GW+ of Al Infrastructure by 2030 (beyond current 2.9GW backlog), leveraging NVIDIA’s financial strength to secure access to additional land and powered shells; (2) deepened technical integration that should enable CoreWeave to remain among the very first to market with new NVIDIA compute architectures; (3) potential for the company’s SUNK and Mission Control,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. Shares of Humana (NYSE: HUM) are down just over 19%, or by $68 a share. All after the Trump Administration proposed nearly flat rates for Medicare Advantage insurers. “The proposal entails a net average payment increase of 0.09% for Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to a press release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as noted by CNBC. That number is significantly less than Wall Street analysts’ expectations that the agency would propose a rate increase of between 4% to 6% for next year.” Not helping, President Trump has said he wants to get rid of insurance brokers and corporate middlemen. All in an effort to help cut healthcare premiums, as noted in the Administration’s Great Healthcare Plan. That plan can be read here. Other health insurance stocks, like UnitedHealth, are down about $70 a share on that news. Not helping, the company just issued softer-than-expected revenue with a poor 2026 outlook. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is gaining momentum ahead of earnings on Thursday. Helping, JPMorgan reiterated its overweight rating on Apple. It also raised its price target to $315 from $305 ahead of Apple’s first-quarter earnings. Evercore ISI added Apple to its Tactical Outperform list, arguing that strong iPhone demand positions the company for strong earnings. The firm added, “We remain positive on shares of AAPL heading into the Dec-qtr earnings this Thursday, as our checks suggest that there’s near-term upside to street estimates, driven by strong iPhone demand and a minimal memory cost headwind (through the Mar-qtr),” as quoted by CNBC. Analysts at Citigroup say that the surge in demand for iPhone 17 models carried through the end of the year. In addition, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, “First-quarter revenue is expected to demonstrate year-over-year growth ranging from 10% to 12%, which translates to $136.7B to $139.2B. This would easily eclipse Apple’s previous record high quarterly revenue of $124.3B set during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. What’s more, it would stand as Apple’s most significant year-over-year revenue jump since the first quarter of fiscal 2022, when it posted an 11.2% increase,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. Cantor Fitzgerald just reiterated their overweight rating on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) ahead of earnings. The firm noted that ahead of tomorrow’s call, Tesla is likely to disclose its 2026 vehicle delivery outlook. It’s looking to see if the company is guiding for growth or for another year of soft sales, which will be a key catalyst for TSLA. At the moment, we know that TSLA finished 2025 with weak European sales as BYD continues to outperform Elon Musk’s company. On an annual basis, Tesla’s European sales were down 27% year over year, as compared to BYD’s 286.6% jump year over year. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Δ The layoffs will affect about 700 workers, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Pinterest said in the filing that the move is part of a restructuring plan that supports its transformation initiatives. The plan involves moving resources to AI-focused roles and teams and “prioritizing AI-powered products and capabilities.” “Although the company is reducing its overall staffing levels with these actions in the near term, the company plans to reinvest in key development areas and strategic opportunities,” the filing said. Pinterest expects to complete the plan, which also involves scaling back its office space, by the end of the third quarter, per the filing. The company has been increasing its focus on AI for some time. On an earnings call in November, management said the platform has shifted from a digital mood board into what CEO Bill Ready called an “AI-powered visual-first shopping assistant.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The company said at the time that AI now underpins almost every part of its platform, from search and discovery to shopping recommendations, along with the then-new conversational Pinterest Assistant. Pinterest Assistant is designed to help users find products and ideas that match their tastes, expanding the platform’s long-standing focus on inspiration into one centered on action. The assistant is aimed at making Pinterest “a more actionable destination,” combining search, personalization and shopping within one experience. At the same time, Pinterest also introduced AI-powered upgrades to its boards that produce tailored recommendations based on each user’s activity and saved Pins. Pinterest’s job cuts are the third in a series of layoffs at high-profile tech companies so far this year. Last week saw reports that Amazon was preparing to cut 14,000 corporate workers, part of its effort to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs. The latest round of cuts was reportedly concentrated on four areas, including Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology, the company’s human resources division. Earlier this month, it was reported that Meta plans to eliminate 10% of the jobs in its Reality Labs unit as it focuses less on virtual reality products and more on AI wearables.

NEW YORK (AP) — Pinterest plans to lay off under 15% of its workforce, as part of broader restructuring that arrives as the image-sharing platform pivots more of its money to artificial intelligence. In a Tuesday securities filing, San Francisco-based Pinterest said it was making these cuts to support “transformation initiatives” — which include reallocating the company’s resources to AI-focused roles and prioritizing AI-powered products. It said it was also working to reshape its “sales and go-to-market approach.” Beyond the coming layoffs, Pinterest said it will reduce office space. The company expects to complete its restructuring plan by the end of September, incurring pretax charges of $35 million to $45 million. Pinterest’s job cuts are expected to impact hundreds of workers. As of the end of last year, Pinterest had a total headcount of about 5,200 employees, the company confirmed to The Associated Press. Like other tech and social media companies, Pinterest has accelerated its integration of AI recently, particularly in consumer-facing offerings. In October, the company introduced AI-powered updates to users’ in-platform “boards” and unveiled Pinterest Assistant, which is also powered by AI and gives users shopping recommendations. Pinterest isn’t the first company to turn to job cuts while pivoting spending to AI. Last fall, Amazon, for example, said it would cut about 14,000 corporate jobs (close to 4% of its workforce) as it ramped up AI investments while trimming costs elsewhere. Shares of Pinterest fell more than 9% as of midday trading Tuesday.

Shares of UnitedHealth Group led a sell-off in health insurance stocks on Tuesday after the company reported its quarterly results and the Trump administration announced Medicare rates would be effectively unchanged next year. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Monday night estimated payments to private Medicare Advantage plans will rise just 0.09% next year, a much smaller increase than expected. Next year’s rate increase also pales in comparison to recent years; CMS estimated payments would rise by 5% this year and about 4% in 2025. UnitedHealth (UNH) stock fell nearly 20%, closing at its lowest level since August and pulling the Dow Jones Industrial Average down on an otherwise positive day for U.S. equities. (Follow Investopedia's live markets coverage here.) Shares of Humana (HUM) dropped 21%, while Aetna owner CVS Health (CVS) and Elevance Health (ELV) each slid 14%. Healthcare stocks, with a few exceptions, have posted lackluster returns in recent years, weighed on by Wall Street's AI obsession and mounting frustration among consumers and politicians over high healthcare costs. The Trump administration's efforts to address affordability ahead of this year's midterm elections could generate more headwinds for the industry. The healthcare sector entered the year with momentum, having risen double digits in the last months of 2025 as investor concerns about an AI stock bubble drove a risk-off pivot. Still, the sector has trailed the market for years and could continue to lag as political risks loom. Healthcare investors are wary of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal critic of the industry, and President Trump's push to lower costs in a healthcare system that a record number of Americans say is unaffordable. While investors digested the news on Medicare rates, UnitedHealth's quarterly results also weighed on sentiment Tuesday. The company's fourth-quarter revenue of $113.2 billion fell short of expectations while adjusted earnings per share were in line with forecasts at $2.11. In 2026, total revenue should exceed $439 billion, a 2% year-over-year decrease “reflecting planned right-sizing across the enterprise,” according to the company. UnitedHealthcare, the conglomerate's insurance subsidiary, expects to insure up to 2.8 million fewer people this year, and Medicare Advantage is forecast to account for nearly half of that reduction. UnitedHealth is in the midst of a turnaround effort prompted by a stock meltdown last year, when shares traded at their lowest price since the depths of 2020’s Covid crash. The stock had its worst day in 25 years last April when it slashed its full-year profit forecast, citing both high health care costs and “heightened care activity.” Shares continued to slide in the following months as the company withdrew its guidance completely, its CEO stepped down, and the Justice Department opened an investigation of its Medicare Advantage billing practices. Update—Jan. 27, 2026: This article was updated with closing prices on Tuesday.

Title: Inside the world of Rick Rieder, the $2.3 trillion insomniac who might soon run the Fed

Sometime in the early 1970s, a young Rick Rieder sat in his elementary school cafeteria, not eating. Instead, he stared at his lunch money—a quarter—and weighed the probability of an Oakland Raiders victory. He would obsess over microdata, like how the football team played on turf versus grass, searching for a marginal edge that would turn his 25 cents into fifty. Then, he’d bet. When he lost, he went hungry, he told podcaster and author William Green. That hunger never really went away. He told Green he “gets grumpy during bull markets,” and prefers when the market loses its nerve. Now chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, Rieder has what he admits is a “maniacal” obsession with data that helps him to pick through the wreckage, find the arbitrage, or get out early. “The whole gig,” he said, is managing risk well enough to know when it is time to leave. In the past week, Rieder has surged on prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, overtaking institutional favorites like the “Two Kevins” (Hassett and Warsh) to become a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve. His career has been a master class in institutional survival. In July 1987, a 25-year-old Rieder joined former brokerage E.F. Hutton just months before “Black Monday” sent the markets plunging 22% in a single day, forcing the 80-year-old firm into a fire-sale merger with Lehman Brothers. He survived the transition—by his own telling, owing to a “lucky” sudden opening—and spent nearly two decades at Lehman. He departed in May 2008, narrowly before Lehman collapsed into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, to found his own firm, R3 Capital. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink acquired R3 a year later, he installed Rieder at the helm of what would become the largest investment platform in the world, making him a “super investor” managing $2.3 trillion dollars in global bond markets, a sum larger than the annual GDP of most countries in the world. Through the implosions of these two august institutions, Rieder never lost his cool, former colleagues say. Josh Tarnow, a former BlackRock managing director who followed Rieder from Lehman to BlackRock and has watched him “daily in conflict” for three decades, attested to Rieder’s ability to home in when it mattered. “He is very good at accessing his resources, and he is incredibly calm,” Tarnow told Fortune. That temperament is why Tarnow and other longtime colleagues describe Rieder as “made for” what may be the riskiest job in the world: managing the U.S. economy. His momentum on Polymarket has surprised the economic establishment. Rieder hasn’t worked at the Fed before, unlike the other main contenders. Stephen Moore, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, told Fortune the candidacy was a “curveball.” He added that he didn’t know much about the Wall Street candidate. “I should probably be studying up on him,” he said. But those who have watched Rieder since his early days at Lehman are less surprised. Several of his old colleagues told Fortune that the Fed is a natural next challenge for a man who “lives for the markets.”“Especially over the last five years—and maybe over the last 10, 20 years—there’s been an argument in the market that the Fed tends to be late, and that they don’t like looking forward,” a former colleague who worked with Rieder at BlackRock, said. “And so I think Rick will do a great job bridging the gap between a forward-looking approach—everything about his job today is to look forward and project and invest for the future—as opposed to looking backwards.” Green, having interviewed Rieder years ago, said he was surprised that markets underestimated the bond trader for so long. He fits Trump’s model of “central casting”—hiring people who look the part—extraordinarily well, he said.“There’s something about a powerful man, with a lot of money under his control who’s so clearly a winner; I think is very seductive to [the president],” Green said. Rieder’s arc, in retrospect, could look inevitable. It wasn’t. Before he was managing crises for others, he had to work his way out of his own. In high school, Rieder was not just a “mediocre” student, but what he describes as completely “motivationally challenged” and “directionless,” he told podcaster Jon Schultz. While he struggled with liberal arts subjects like history, English literature, and philosophy, which “didn’t sink in,” he did display a specific aptitude: He excelled in typing and accounting, finding the latter logical and “intuitive,” he told Green. Despite this spark, he admits he was a “gym rat” who spent most of his time hanging out and watching movies rather than studying. The “catalyzing event,” as Rieder calls it, occurred while sitting on a rock, on a golf course behind his parents’ house, in Scarsdale, N.Y. After receiving a set of dismal grades during his freshman year at Hobart College, which placed him on “social and academic probation,” Rieder sat on that rock for four hours, terrified by the thought of his father’s reaction. His father was an entrepreneur who ran an office products company called American Unifax. Rieder had watched his father work relentlessly to keep his typewriter ribbon and correction fluid business alive, even as computer technology rendered the products “quickly antiquated” and put the family through tough times, he said. Paralyzed by that contrast with his own trajectory, Rieder realized he had gained weight, was drinking too much beer, and “going nowhere,” he told Green. He credits his roommate for reinforcing the idea that they had to “move on” from their lifestyle of watching movies and hanging out in the gym. He overhauled his life, and the pair transferred from Hobart to Emory University. He found a curriculum that mirrored his internal wiring: business. Once he began taking finance, marketing, and management classes, Rieder said he felt “the ball start rolling downhill”; he transformed from being a near-dropout on probation to an award-winning finance student, ultimately finishing third in his class (though he notes in interviews that his wife, whom he met at Emory, finished first). The ball rolled down the hill, and into the abyss of obsession. Rieder, it seems, does everything at either 100% or at zero. At Wharton, where he earned his MBA, Rieder recalls a visiting executive from the Golden Nugget casino explaining how casinos really make money. Rieder raised his hand and said it was because the odds favored the house. The executive corrected him. Casinos win, he said, because gamblers arrive with $200—and when they lose it, they’re forced to leave. The house, by contrast, has infinite liquidity and time. “And I thought, ‘Gosh, when you oscillate, you hit the down 200, you leave,’” Rieder told Green. “So almost, statistically, you’re always going to hit the down 200 if you stay there long enough. It just emblazoned in my mind the philosophy around the random walk alongside of a trend, and just making sure you’re being thoughtful about optimizing it versus being on the wrong side of it.”That realization, that survival is a matter of staying in the game long enough to let the trend play itself out, transformed Rieder’s life. It wasn’t as simple as adopting a work ethic. He engineered a lifestyle designed to prevent ever hitting his own “down 200” moment, a state of being that his colleagues find both impressive and bewildering. Rieder “doesn’t sleep,” Tarnow said. Or rather, he sleeps a maximum of four hours a night. Colleagues said you can expect emails from him as early as 3 a.m. or as late as 11 p.m. However early they came to the office, Rieder was always earlier, and no matter how late they stayed, Rieder stayed later, they said. “He’s the hardest worker in the room,” two former colleagues said. His house in Florida is covered with massive flat-screen TVs set to markets. He checks Apple’s earnings reports on vacation. And during the Green interview, he even requested permission to execute a trade because he “can’t sit still” while the bond yield curve moves. The effort comes from a distinct passion, his colleagues said, but Rieder has also said it comes from acute anxiety. Rieder told Green that he tracked his biometric data with the Whoop ring, and found that his stress levels peaked at 11:30 p.m., the moment he was forced to disconnect and sleep despite Asian markets being open. They plummet at 3:45 a.m., the moment he finally gets to wake up and grab his phone. “I hate the feeling of not being in control while sleeping,” he told Green. He only relaxes once he can see the markets moving. Trading fixed income is a distinctly different game than trading stocks. In the stock market, traders typically hunt for the upside, trying to find the next big thing that they can ride to the moon. Bond traders like Rieder, by contrast, are constantly staring down the cliff of what could go wrong. For Rieder, managing $2.7 trillion in fixed income means overseeing a massive sea of debt that is constantly under threat from inflation, rising interest rates, and other geopolitical “exogenous” events. There are pressures and risks you cannot prepare for, but you just have to learn how to “make a little bit of money a lot of times,” one of his former colleagues said. The way to win out over decades—often beating benchmark indexes—is just to ensure that you are always hedged enough, and have enough liquidity, to never hit the statistical “down 200” that forces you to leave. How do you measure success in that kind of game? Rieder has said he doesn’t feel successful. “I still feel like I’m going to get fired every day,” he told Green. To the average person, Rieder’s work style sounds crazy. But to fellow finance people, it’s magnetic. Since Lehman, Rieder has accumulated a distinct group of 42 people who followed him from Lehman to R3 to BlackRock, endlessly loyal to their boss, because they knew when push came to shove, they’d never lose because they didn’t try hard enough, his former colleagues said.“Rick was able to find a good balance between being supercompetitive and very demanding, while also trying to take great care of the people that were working alongside of him,” a colleague who worked with him at Lehman and BlackRock said. He understands if people don’t share his same lifestyle aspirations, and during particularly tough weekends, he was known to buy new tech gadgets to share with the team like the Meta sunglasses where you could listen to music while playing sports, a former colleague said. Another colleague noted that after a rough year early on in his career, Rieder bought him a “brightly colored tie” as a fun gift. He also, Tarnow said, took time to help his people when the company was transitioning; finding the right opportunities here and there for others.“This is a guy that’s always worried about people more than himself,” Tarnow said. Ultimately, the constant assessment of what could go wrong has made Rieder a distinctly humble figure in an industry often defined by ego. Every colleague and partner interviewed by Fortune used the word “humility” to describe him. In high-stakes environments, like meetings with powerful CEOs or angry clients, Rieder is known as a listener rather than a talker. “He holds the room because he is a very good listener; he entertains different opinions,” Tarnow said. “He’s a seeker of truth. This is a guy that is doing the best he can to get to the truth.”But even in lower-stakes environments, he has the same attitude. He takes on multiple charitable endeavors. Paul Bambrick-Santoyo, who leads Uncommon Schools, the Newark charter school system that Rieder has invested in and where he’s served on the board for 20 years, noted that most people at the school would never recognize how influential he is in the global economy because of how quietly he carries himself. “There’s a kindness and a gentleness to him that we get to see every day in the work he does with us,” he told Fortune. “He has an incredible sense of service and never takes credit for anything.” Shawn Shivalkar, who cofounded a popular alternative investment club at Emory University under Rieder’s guidance, recalls a similarly disarming presence during their first meeting at BlackRock. Sitting in an office filled with messy papers and massive screens displaying markets moving, Shivalkar found a man who was “super engaged” but completely unpretentious. “He just had all his screens up, and he was just asking us questions,” Shivalkar told Fortune. “And he was bouncing a basketball up over his head, just kind of tossing it up in the air and catching it. It wasn’t like a, ‘All right, I’m here to trick you with a bunch of twisty questions’ kind of meeting. It was a very productive and respectful dialogue.” What does this all mean in terms of his fitness to serve as Fed chair? Well, for his colleagues, it seems obvious that he is the best fit for the role: “No one’s going to care more or have more passion for doing the job,” one former colleague said. No one will outwork him, or have more of a will to the truth. But that assumes, of course, that Rieder can stay motivated without the constant, short-term pressure of the markets. One of his former colleagues was surprised that Rieder would want the role, given how staid the position is and how he would have to survive the browbeating of politics for credibility instead of operating on his own logic. Can a man biologically hardwired to be anxious when markets close, whose mantra, according to his old colleagues, was, “It’s not about being right, it’s about making money,” ultimately ignore markets when needing to make a tough interest rate call and pretend not to care how much money is on the line with his decision? The question matters especially now, as the White House has grown increasingly sensitive to market reactions and Trump has repeatedly criticized and threatened Fed Chair Powell for keeping interest rates high even as investors pushed for relief. Rieder’s own politics are slightly elusive. He donated to and supported Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), but he has also donated half a million to Republican PACs to support Trump’s presidency. His former colleagues say they’d be shocked if Rieder threw away his role to become a simple loyalist. Tarnow said the job would ultimately “free” Rieder. “I think it’d be freeing for him, that his responsibility isn’t to make money,” Tarnow said. The data-obsessed Rieder could consider variables he hadn’t been able to before, when he was just focused on his fiduciary responsibility: “His responsibility set is to guide the country fiscally to a point where we’re at our best.” His mantra, according to former colleagues, is also, “Work hard, play hard, give back.” Rieder told Green he has signs that say that all over his house. Now, Tarnow says, he might get the ultimate opportunity to give back. “This is a guy that wants this,” Tarnow said.

Title: Coinbase Forms Quantum Computing Advisory Board as Bitcoin Security Concerns Grow

Time Published: 2026-01-27T17:00:00Z

Coinbase has launched an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain to proactively safeguard Bitcoin and other digital assets against potential future quantum threats. Earlier this week, Coinbase announced the creation of an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain, aiming to safeguard the crypto ecosystem against emerging quantum threats. The board will bring together leading experts in quantum computing, cryptography, and blockchain to assess risks and provide guidance to the broader industry. Quantum computers, if scaled successfully, could compromise the cryptography that underpins major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase, in their announcement, stressed that preparing for these future challenges is crucial to maintaining the security of digital assets. The advisory board includes notable figures such as quantum computing pioneer Scott Aaronson, Stanford cryptography expert Dan Boneh, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, and Coinbase’s own Head of Cryptography, Yehuda Lindell. The group says they will publish position papers, recommend best practices for long-term security, and respond to significant advances in quantum computing. This initiative is part of Coinbase’s larger post-quantum security strategy, which also includes updating Bitcoin address handling, enhancing internal key management, and advancing research on post-quantum signature schemes. The board’s first position paper is expected early next year, laying out a roadmap for quantum resilience in blockchain systems. Coinbase said the move underscores the importance of proactive planning, ensuring the crypto industry remains prepared, not reactive, as quantum technology evolves. Over the last several months, concerns over quantum computing’s potential impact on Bitcoin have begun to ripple through traditional finance, prompting some investors to radically rethink their exposure to the cryptocurrency. Jefferies strategist Christopher Wood recently removed Bitcoin from his Greed & Fear model portfolio, citing the existential risk that large-scale quantum computers could undermine the cryptographic foundations securing digital assets. While the threat is not imminent, Wood and other institutional voices — including BlackRock and UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti — warn that quantum advances could eventually allow attackers to derive private keys from public ones, putting millions of BTC at risk. As a result, Wood replaced Bitcoin with gold and gold-mining equities, emphasizing that long-term store-of-value claims for digital assets may be less reliable in the face of accelerating technological change. The debate over quantum computing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is intensifying. Coinbase research indicates that roughly 20% to 50% of Bitcoin’s supply, particularly coins in older wallet formats, could be vulnerable to so-called long-range quantum attacks. Crypto developers and researchers are divided over the urgency of implementing quantum-resistant solutions, with some advocating proactive upgrades and others arguing the risk remains distant. Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor believes that quantum computing will actually strengthen Bitcoin rather than threaten it. Network upgrades and coin migrations will boost security, while lost coins remain frozen, Saylor posted.

Title: Here's what to expect at the Fed's first interest rate meeting of 2026
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-meeting-january-28-interest-rate-decision-jerome-powell/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T16:57:48Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News Updated on: January 27, 2026 / 11:57 AM EST / CBS News President Trump has pressed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but central bank officials are unlikely to deliver a first cut of 2026 when they announce their next policy move on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to keep the federal funds rate — what banks charge each other for short-term loans — in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The pause would come after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate at three consecutive meetings late last year. The meeting also comes amid weeks of turmoil involving the Fed. The Department of Justice earlier this month opened an investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell related to the central bank's renovation of its historic buildings, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence. The Supreme Court is also currently weighing whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to fire her. Mr. Trump, who has assailed Powell for failing to deliver deeper rate cuts, is also soon expected to name a successor to Powell, whose term as Fed chief expires in May. Against that backdrop, the Fed will make its rate decision while weighing two potentially troubling economic trends: A weakening labor market and an inflation rate that remains well above the central bank's annual target of 2%. "It's appropriate that they take a little bit of a beat to digest the information and try to set the stage for 2026," Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News. "It probably would have been a sleepy meeting if it weren't for the Supreme Court hearing about Lisa Cook, the [Justice Department] investigation into the renovation and the search for the replacement for the Fed chair." On Wednesday, Powell will have to pivot from the political drama around his tenure at the Fed to explaining the economic rationale behind the central bank's latest monetary calculus. The Fed chief has repeatedly stated that the Fed's policy moves are determined by data, not by political pressure from the White House. The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 28, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The press conference, which typically lasts for 45 minutes, provides the Fed chair with an opportunity to discuss the thinking behind the interest-rate decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting committee. The Fed's rate decisions ripple through the economy because they influence what banks charge for loans, ranging from credit card APRs to auto loans. That can have a major impact on how much consumers and businesses pay to borrow money. If the Fed keeps rates steady, as economists expect, consumers may not feel much of an impact. A single 0.25 percentage-point rate cut, the Fed's typical reduction, doesn't do much to alter borrowing costs, Bankrate's Kates said. Even so, the Trump administration is seeking to convince voters that it is tackling affordability, an issue for many Americans who are feeling strained after several years of above-average inflation. As part of that effort, Mr. Trump has announced plans to cap credit card rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, among other steps the administration says are aimed at lowering costs. Meanwhile, borrowing costs have already eased for many types of products following last year's multiple rate cuts, noted LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz. "Rates on several types of loans are at their lowest levels in years and should keep drifting down for a little while longer," Schulz said in an email. "That's a relief at a time when affordability is still a real struggle for many families." Mr. Trump could announce his nominee to replace Powell as early as this week, according to SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy. Among the top candidates for the role are National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of financial services firm BlackRock, has also more recently emerged as a leading contender, according to the betting markets, Duy noted. "It's a little surprising to see Rick Rieder coming out as a frontrunner — he's someone who was not really talked about four weeks ago," Kates said. "He doesn't come from the traditional feeder program for the Fed chair — it would be a little bit of an out-of-left-field choice, but that's something this administration has tried to make a habit of." Appointing a new Fed chair who is amenable to Mr. Trump's wish for lower interest rates may not be enough to move the needle. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed chair is only one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady. Powell is likely to stress the importance of the Fed's independence at Wednesday's meeting, experts said. "We expect that Powell will use his platform to provide an erudite but accessible defense of central bank independence," said RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas in a report. "This news conference, following a tumultuous two weeks, will be the next step in defining Powell's legacy. Edited by Alain Sherter In: © 2026 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Sign up for your daily dose of dope. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sànchez partied in Paris while The Washington Post braced for more layoffs. Contact us by Email Jan. 27 2026, Published 11:25 a.m. ET Tech billionaire Jeff Bezos has been slammed for partying with his wife Lauren Sànchez in Paris for Haute Couture Week while staffers at his publication, The Washington Post, panic ahead of planned layoffs, RadarOnline.com can reveal. Staffers have reportedly begged Bezos, 62, to intervene and have taken to social media to share their stories in hopes their boss has a change of heart. Bezos and his wife attended couture fashion shows in Paris while staffers feared their jobs would be cut. While Bezos and Sànchez brushed shoulders with celebrities at couture fashion shows like Schiaparelli and Dior and posed for photos on the red carpet, staffers back home at the Washington Post were racked with anxiety wondering whether or not their jobs were on the chopping block. The publication is set to face another round of layoffs, which are believed to be rolled out in February after leadership delayed downsizing plans. Some reports estimated upwards of 300 employees could be impacted, with newsroom positions, including sports, metro and foreign affairs, taking the brunt of the force. "I've never experienced such a feeling of dread," one Post insider reportedly told an outlet. Bezos purchased The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013. Fear and uncertainty have gripped the paper as staff have been left in the dark about when the layoffs will happen and how many jobs will be axed. Managing editor Kimi Yoshino sent a memo to the sports division informing staff a correspondent would not be sent to cover the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan, Italy, which is set to kick off in less than two weeks. "We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you," the memo read, according to the Guardian. Adding to bewilderment over the decision was the fact that the Post was said to have already spent around $80,000 in preparation for covering the Winter Olympics. "It's all very confusing, and no one knows anything," said another staffer, who was not authorized to comment. "The anxiety is so sad." Hundreds of staffers, mostly from the newsroom, are expected to lose their jobs. Meanwhile, Foreign Post staff penned Bezos a letter urging him to rethink downsizing and to consider the powerful role his publication plays worldwide. "We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance – not the shared success that remains attainable," a portion of the letter signed by 60 staffers read. Among the 60 staffers who signed off on the letter were the Post's top international journalists. The group noted they were open to "finding ways to reduce our costs even further" and work with leadership "while retaining as many jobs as we can." "We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and they lose relevance," the letter added.

On social media, staff launched the hashtag "#SaveThePost" in hopes their personal stories could sway the Amazon founder from going through with the layoffs. "Hi @JeffBezos. We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team 'bada-- beacons of hope.' We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost," wrote Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O'Grady on X. "As international correspondents and reporters for the @washingtonpost, we risk our safety to investigate authoritarian governments, report from gang-controlled towns and document evidence of stolen elections. This on-the-ground reporting is more critical than ever," added Mexico City bureau chief Samantha Schmidt. "I've driven into hurricanes, trekked through jungles and camped on an ice sheet in sub-zero temperatures to bring you news about climate change," pleaded another journalist.

Title: Nancy Pelosi Just Doubled Down on AI Again

Investing Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi exercised options in Vistra (VST) and Tempus AI (TEM) as part of $69M in trades. Vistra supplies power to AI data centers and struck deals with Meta Platforms covering 2,600+ megawatts. Tempus AI applies AI to precision medicine in oncology and cardiology. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi is often portrayed as the most successful stock trader in Congress, having built a substantial fortune largely through well-timed investments in technology stocks. Her trading record has drawn intense scrutiny over the years, with critics alleging that she and other lawmakers may benefit from insights tied to their official oversight roles. Many of the trades occurred just prior to significant events benefiting the company and its stock. While no wrongdoing has been proven, every new trade tends to attract outsized attention from investors. That attention spiked again last week when Pelosi’s latest stock trade report was released. The report showed that she continues to increase her exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), pairing large sales of long-held stocks with fresh option exercises and purchases tied to AI-driven companies. In total, the filing reflected roughly $69 million in transaction value, with the trades executed by her husband, Paul Pelosi. In the Jan. 23 filing, Pelosi reported sizable sales in several familiar names. The most significant was Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounted for a large portion of the total dollar value disclosed. She also sold smaller but still meaningful stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). Together, these moves reduced direct exposure to some of the portfolio’s most established tech and media holdings. Apple’s sale stood out as a classic profit-taking move, especially given the stock’s elevated valuation. Nvidia’s sale was more surprising, considering its central role in powering AI workloads. Meanwhile, exiting Disney suggests a broader shift away from traditional entertainment toward faster-growing technology-driven opportunities. Those sales were balanced by option exercises and purchases in several mega-cap technology companies. Pelosi exercised 50 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) call options, originally purchased on January 14, 2025, at a $150 strike price, resulting in a transaction valued between $500,001 and $1,000,000. A nearly identical move was made in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), also exercising 50 calls at a $150 strike within the same value range. Nvidia appeared again on the buy side, with the exercise of 50 call options purchased in January 2025 at an $80 strike, valued between $250,001 and $500,000. These exercises converted previously held options into shares, preserving exposure to the companies most closely tied to cloud computing and AI infrastructure. Notably, Nvidia illustrates a recurring pattern: selling shares while simultaneously using options to regain exposure. This strategy allows investors to lock in gains or reduce risk on existing holdings, while still positioning the portfolio for gains through options. Because options offer leveraged exposure with defined risk, this approach can help manage portfolio concentration while maintaining a bullish outlook. Beyond megacap tech, the filing highlighted targeted bets on AI-adjacent industries. Pelosi exercised options in Vistra (NYSE:VST), an energy company increasingly tied to AI data center demand. Vistra supplies nuclear and natural gas power to energy-hungry AI facilities and has struck major deals, including agreements with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) covering more than 2,600 megawatts. Its recent $4 billion acquisition of gas plants further positions it to benefit from AI-driven electricity demand. She also exercised 50 call options in Tempus AI (NASDAQ: TEM) — valued between $50,001 and $100,000 — from options purchased in January 2025 at a $20 strike. That initial purchase rocketed Tempus to the forefront of investor consciousness and caused its stock to soar. Tempus applies AI to precision medicine, using large datasets to improve diagnostics and treatment decisions in fields like oncology, cardiology, and radiology. Taken together, these trades reflect continued confidence in AI’s long-term growth. By trimming mature tech positions and redeploying capital into AI leaders and enablers such as Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Vistra, and Tempus, the portfolio tilts toward areas likely to see sustained demand from AI adoption. The focus on energy infrastructure and AI-driven healthcare also suggests that the next phase of AI growth may extend well beyond software, reaching into the physical and practical systems that make AI possible.

As the race for the next Federal Reserve Chair heats up, BlackRock's Rick Rieder has suddenly emerged as the new frontrunner on prediction markets to lead the central bank. And if President Trump does tap Rieder for the role, it could be a huge moment for the crypto industry, as BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income isn't just a "crypto curious" but an outspoken advocate for the digital assets. In fact, he might be a bitcoin bull. He said as far back as 2020 — in much earlier days of digital assets — that bitcoin would take over for gold as a store of value, "because it’s so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around," he told CNBC in an interview. And more recently, he told the same outlet that bitcoin should be part of a smart investment mix, saying that the leading digital token and gold were "things that give you a little bit of ballast in the portfolio." In that September interview, when bitcoin was still above $112,000, he predicted "it's going to go up." The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $88,000, having recently fallen amid potential tariff threats and other geopolitical turmoil. Trump has a choice to make before the term of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — who the president has framed as his economic nemesis — is set to expire on May 15. It was Trump who originally placed Powell, a Republican, in that pivotal role, but the president has since routinely lamented his performance, calling him "dumb" and "stupid" and nicknames such as "Mr. Too Late." Meanwhile, Trump has often teased about frontrunners for his replacement, making for a volatile prediction market. Rieder has said it's "an unbelievable honor to even be mentioned in that list." Rieder vocally shares Trump's frustrations at the sedate pace at which the Fed has cut interest rates. In a recent interview during the president's trip to Davos in Switzerland, Trump called Rieder "very impressive," and his odds on Polymarket climbed from under 3% to almost 53% at their peak, before settling currently at around 48%. For the crypto sector, a Fed chair can pull multiple levers. Apart from a heavy influence on the group that sets the federal funds rate, the chair controls the board's regulatory agenda. However, Powell has deferred to the vice chair for supervision, Michelle Bowman, on the Fed's supervisory work. So Rieder's crypto enthusiasm may not have a significant role in the rules the regulatory side of the Fed writes for things like stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). More than as a mechanic of policy, a Fed chair has a softer role as an outsized voice on the health and direction of the U.S. economy, and a staunch bitcoin advocate in that position would be a first. Though Powell is departing soon as chairman, his term as a regular governor on the Fed board continues, leaving some question about whether he'll take the traditional route and exit after his term as chairman expires or stay on for another two years. Every member of the board has an automatic seat on the Federal Open Market Committee, which decides U.S. interest rates, meaning a Powell decision to stay would keep his generally centrist position in place in that group and would fail to open another seat for a Trump appointee. Trump's relentless criticism of Powell escalated last month when his Department of Justice said it's investigating the central bank chairman for his public descriptions of renovations at the Federal Reserve buildings in Washington. Powell released an unusual, direct response. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president," Powell said.

Today’s top news: A sobering note from inside the AI frontier model race. And what does it mean for crypto? 📌 What Happened Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei published an essay warning that AI capabilities are advancing faster than the systems meant to control, govern, and align them. This creates a growing risk gap as models become more autonomous and powerful. Dario’s core thesis is about speed and compounding. Each generation of AI models builds on the last, accelerating progress in a way that compresses timelines and reduces room for error. Meanwhile, safety research, governance frameworks, and institutional responses move linearly, not exponentially. He argues that society is entering a phase where capability gains are no longer matched by proportional improvements in control, especially as models begin to reason, plan, and act with less direct human oversight. Specifically, he expects AGI to come in the next 1-2 years, and shared concerns like 50% of the entry white collar workforce no longer needed within 1-5 years. 🗣️ What They’re Saying Dario framed the challenge starkly: “AI progress is now moving faster than our ability to ensure that it remains aligned with human values and under meaningful human control.” He warned that relying on informal norms or reactive fixes is unlikely to work at scale: “We should not assume that we’ll be able to simply patch problems after deployment once systems become sufficiently autonomous.” And he emphasized that the window for proactive action is shrinking: “The time to build strong safety, governance, and control mechanisms is before systems become overwhelmingly powerful, not after.” 🧠 Why It Matters Dario’s warning lands at an important moment for markets. The AI trade is already one of the dominant macro narratives, pulling in capital, reshaping equity indices, and driving massive investment into compute, data centers, and infrastructure. At the same time, the macro backdrop is shifting. Rates are no longer collapsing, geopolitics are back in focus, and metals are soaring. What about crypto? Well, not much rotation so far in 2026. The good news is—it’s doubtful that the “AI bubble” is going to pop. If anything, the opposite. But that comes with its own set of challenges, and a future 3-years out where half of the white-collar workforce is unemployed is both hard to imagine and hard to model out. Stacking hard assets in preparation for that potential future is likely a good strategy. And Bitcoin remains at the top of the shortlist for many, especially as the metals trade looks like it’s in a blow-off top. Is the rotation coming?

US stock market today: Dow slips as UnitedHealth rout offsets tech rally. S&P 500, Nasdaq hold near records. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 334.77 points to 49,077.63 on Tuesday, weighed down by a 15% plunge in UnitedHealth (UNH). While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose on tech optimism and a landmark India-EU trade deal, health insurers crumbled. The sell-off followed a federal proposal for nearly flat 2027 Medicare Advantage payment hikes. Investors pivoted from healthcare to AI-driven tech ahead of key Microsoft and Tesla earnings.

Title: Virtuix Goes Public During a Turbulent Moment for Consumer VR

Time Published: 2026-01-27T14:49:42Z
Full Content:
VR treadmill creator Virtuix is going public, as its Class A ordinary shares will start trading today on the Global Market tier of the Nasdaq. The company’s stock market debut comes as consumer VR investment and first-party content spending have slowed across the industry. Founded in 2013 by CEO Jan Goetgeluk, Virtuix initially started its journey on Kickstarter with the launch of the original Omni, which garnered $1.1 million from backers. While the company first started out with pretty clear ambitions to enter the consumer market, market realities pushed the company into the out-of-home VR attraction space, forcing it to navigate a significant pivot in its business strategy. Since then, the Austin, Texas-based company has attracted over $55 million in funding from major investors such as Mark Cuban, Maveron, and Scout Ventures, with its latest crowd investment campaign bringing in an additional $3.3 million. Virtuix still sells its enterprise-focused ‘Arena’ solution, however the company made it next big bet by reentering the consumer market with the release of Omni One in 2024, which can be purchased as a full system (Pico headset included) for $3,500, or a bring-your-own PC VR headset system priced at $2,600. Alongside its Nasdaq debut, which is trading under the ticker ‘VTIX’, Virtuix secured an additional $11 million investment from Chicago Venture Partners and established a $50 million equity line of credit, subject to conditions. The company says it plans to use the funding to scale sales of Omni One. “We’re only getting started,” said Goetgeluk. “In a world where we explore increasingly photorealistic virtual worlds, the missing piece is the ability to move through those worlds naturally. We pioneered the technology to make that possible. Going public provides us with access to capital to fund our growth and develop new products.” It’s an interesting time as a consumer-focused VR company to go public, what with Meta’s pullback from the VR games space following the reorganization of its Reality Labs, which saw a reported 10 percent headcount reduction. Granted, that focus is more on the high-end consumer, which likely includes a significant overlap with enterprise. Still, Virtuix’s performance in the market will serve as an important data point as the next phase of consumer VR takes root—i.e. a moment when platform holder dollars have all but stopped flowing into the games ecosystem. After all, it’s one of very few publicly traded companies specializing solely in VR hardware right now that isn’t a major platform holder. That said, it’s a pretty grim time for XR studios right now, as it seems investment dollars for big single-player content has dried up amid a flourishing of free-to-play multiplayer games on the medium’s dominant platform, Meta Quest 3. I’m also waiting to see how Valve’s Steam Frame fares, which still doesn’t have a price or specific release date yet. This comes alongside the closure of three first-party Meta studios, Sanzaru Games (Asgard’s Wrath), Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR port) and Twisted Pixel (Deadpool VR) in addition to layoffs at a number of veteran XR studios, including Mighty Coconut (Walkabout Mini Golf) and Cloudhead Games (Pistol Whip).

Well the fact you can buy it without a headset now makes it more appealing to me. I have a Kat core 2 got for $600 with 2.4 km on it. Hard to beat that price. Not sure an extra 2500$ is worth the money. Turbulent moment for consumer VR? What do you mean? The VR fanboys keep telling me that VR gaming just keeps on growing and growing, it's never been better! @nl_vr If you play flat screen games you are a dinosaur! VR gaming is now dominating! LoL tryed to ping me on these type of boards just show how unknown you are to how things work and what a bully you are. So pathetic when you can't win arguments you go over to personal insults When do you think Sony will reveal the PSVR3? Yadda yadda yadda Well, good luck!

Title: What Davos Revealed About BlackRock, Ripple And XRP: Pundits Weigh In

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A panel of XRP-focused commentators is leaning heavily into Davos optics as evidence that BlackRock and Ripple are converging on a shared vision for tokenized finance, even as none of the participants produced direct confirmation of a formal partnership between the two firms. Host Versan Aljarrah opened by pointing to “BlackRock and Brad Garlinghouse at Davos,” asking guest Jake Claver what he took from their presence and the “conclusion they had over there.” Claver’s answer centered on what he said he heard from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about settlement consolidation. “He mentioned that it would be ideal if everything was on one blockchain or at least settled back to one blockchain,” Claver said. “For Ripple to be in the room and having been in the room for years at this point, it gives me you know a lot of confidence that it is the XRPL […] I feel like BlackRock and Ripple are much more involved than people realize.” Today we’re joined by @beyond_broke to discuss BlackRock’s quiet ties with Ripple, the soft disclosures around XRP, and the future of digitization and tokenization. Excited to have everyone back together for this one.https://t.co/oMHGWqMehB pic.twitter.com/u1s7LyOAhs — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 26, 2026 Aljarrah immediately widened the claim beyond Davos stagecraft, asserting, “it’s quite obvious at this point that Blackrock, JP Morgan, Ripple and all these major banks they have some ties to Ripple [and] XRP,” before returning to the recurring theme that Davos access itself is a filter. Later, he argued that the set of crypto-native executives allowed near institutions like the WEF and BIS was narrowing and that Garlinghouse’s inclusion mattered more than “headline hype.” David (Digital Outlook) pushed the discussion toward implementation, but repeatedly brought BlackRock back into the frame as a connective thread in Ripple’s institutional strategy. “When it came out to like, okay, has Ripple really positioned themselves to be like […] the main leader in the space […] with the acquisitions that they’ve made […] custody with Palisade,” he said. “I think they got Metaco and Standard Custody in there […] clearance through Hidden Road, all that. Then […] you see all these other linkages between their partners like what they’re doing with Blackrock. You know, they’ve got some stuff going on there.” A second line of argument was that BlackRock’s eventual entry could be the trigger for an XRP liquidity event. Edo Farina framed it in “order size” terms: “It takes one huge institutional order from a Blackrock a great scale and that’s it,” he said, claiming market pricing can stay muted if institutional positioning happens through OTC arrangements. Claver added: “When Blackrock steps in, there will be likely a supply shock that allows XRP to decouple from the rest of the crypto market and Bitcoin,” and tied that idea to a viral episode the panel said briefly moved XRP out of sync with the rest of crypto. “We’ve seen it decoupled once […] when […] the [fake] trust that had been filed in Delaware for Blackrock’s iShares XRP ETF […] hit Twitter,” Claver said. Still, BlackRock’s observable crypto footprint still tilts towards Ethereum and Bitcoin rather than XRP. BlackRock’s flagship US spot exposure is via products tracking bitcoin and ether, IBIT and ETHA, while its tokenization beachhead has also been Ethereum-first: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, and only later expanded to additional networks. Also, BlackRock’s own 2026 thematic outlook is explicitly naming Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that “collects the toll” as tokenization scales, with stablecoins treated as an early proxy for tokenization “in action.” BlackRock highlights data indicating “65%+” of tokenized assets sit on Ethereum, an argument for why “one blockchain” speculation often defaults to ETH in institutional circles. At press time, XRP traded at $1.88. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Futures tied to major indexes are mixed this morning as chip stocks gain while health insurance stocks tumble; shares of UntedHealth and other health insurers are sliding after a government proposal to raise payments to Medicare insurers by much less than expected in 2027; UnitedHealth, Boeing and General Motors were among the big-name companies reporting earnings this morning; Micron Technology is leading chip stocks higher after the company said it has broken ground on a new manufacturing facility in Singapore; and Salesforce shares are gaining after the company announced that it has won a contract from the U.S. Army worth up to $5.6 billion over the next decade. Here's what you need to know today. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq are higher this morning as chip stocks rise, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are sharply lower as shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) plunge. (more on that below) The major indexes each gained on Monday to kick off a busy week of earnings reports, as investors await the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates tomorrow. The Dow and the S&P 500 come into the day just 0.4% away from their record closing highs. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were recently up 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow futures slid 0.5%. Gold futures are holding steady this morning at around $5,080 an ounce, after surging above the $5,000 mark for the first time over the weekend and setting a new record high on Monday. Bitcoin was also little changed at around $88,000, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was at 4.23%, up from 4.21% at yesterday's close. Several health insurer stocks are tumbling ahead of the opening bell following a proposal from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to increase payments to insurers by just 0.09% next year, well below what the industry had been expecting. Wall Street had been expecting a bump between 4% and 6%, according to The Wall Street Journal. The proposal also includes modifications to rules about diagnosing patients, amid a Department of Justice investigation following Journal reports last year that claimed UnitedHealth trained its doctors to diagnose Medicare Advantage patients with specific conditions that could result in higher payouts for the insurer, which the company has denied. UnitedHealth also reported fourth-quarter results this morning, with $113.22 billion in revenue and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share coming in roughly in line with estimates, while its 2026 revenue forecasts were lower than expected. UnitedHealth shares were down 16% in recent premarket trading, while Humana (HUM) plunged 17% and CVS Health (CVS), which owns Aetna, fell 12%. Investors are digesting quarterly results from a number of big-name companies this morning, as Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), United Parcel Service (UPS) and American Airlines (AAL) have all released earnings reports. Boeing shares were down about 1% recently after the aircraft manufacturer reported fourth-quarter revenue that topped estimates, while its profits were boosted by the sale of pieces of its Digital Aviation Solutions business. GM shares were up nearly 4% after the automaker raised its guidance, boosted its dividend and announced a $6 billion stock buyback plan. GM posted a $3.3 billion loss for the fourth quarter, as it took over $7 billion in charges related to a restructuring of its electric vehicle business. UPS shares also gained about 4% after the shipping giant topped estimates in its fourth-quarter report. American Airlines shares were up more than 3% recently after its first-quarter revenue projection came in higher than expected. Investors will get more earnings over the rest of the week, including highly anticipated reports from major tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA). Shares of Micron Technology (MU) are leading chipmaker stocks higher this morning after the company announced that it has broken ground on construction for a new manufacturing facility in Singapore. The new factory, which will be part of the memory component maker's existing complex in Singapore, represents a roughly $24 billion investment over the next decade, the company said late last night. The new facility is expected to start production in the second half of 2028, and Micron also said that construction for another facility in the Singapore complex designed for high-bandwidth memory chips is on track to "contribute meaningfully" to its chip supply next year. Micron shares, which have more than tripled over the past year amid booming demand for memory and data storage devices from the AI data center buildout, were up 4% recently. Shares of others in the sector, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Intel (INTC) and Sandisk (SNDK), are also gaining this morning. Salesforce (CRM) shares are rising after the software giant announced that it has been chosen for a contract with the U.S. Army for up to 10 years and $5.6 billion. The Army will be able to use Salesforce's AI software "as the foundation for its agentic enterprise," which the company said will help the Pentagon manage costs and make decisions more efficiently. The contract includes a five-year base period, with another five-year optional buying period with a total purchase ceiling of $5.6 billion, and expands on previous deals where the military would buy individual pieces of software from Salesforce. Shares of the software maker were up 3% in recent premarket trading.

Title: XRG to increase stake in NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG project

XRG has announced plans to increase its stake in NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG project, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal facility at the Port of Brownsville in Texas, US. The energy investment company, owned by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), will acquire an additional 7.6% equity interest in Trains 4 and 5 at the project from Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a subsidiary of BlackRock. This move is part of XRG’s strategy to bolster its position in the global LNG market. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more The acquisition follows XRG’s earlier investment in phase one of the project, where it purchased an indirect 11.7% stake in Trains 1–3 through the same partner. As part of this previous transaction, ADNOC Trading secured a 20-year LNG offtake agreement for 1.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from Train 4. Trains 4 and 5 are each expected to produce approximately 6mtpa of LNG, with long-term agreements already in place with high-credit-quality offtakers. The Rio Grande LNG facility is expected to play a significant role in the US economy by generating more than 5,000 construction jobs and approximately 700 long-term positions in the Rio Grande Valley. Financial specifics of the current transaction remain undisclosed, and it is contingent upon customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. XRG international gas business president Mohamed Al Aryani said: “Expanding our investment in Rio Grande LNG reinforces XRG’s commitment to delivering on our global gas strategy and advancing the vital role LNG plays in providing reliable and flexible energy supply to international markets. “The project continues to progress well, with strong construction momentum marking steady steps toward bringing new LNG capacity online. “By growing our presence in US LNG, we are strengthening a resilient, globally scaled gas platform while further deepening the UAE [United Arab Emirates]–US energy partnership – supporting energy security, jobs and investment‑driven growth.” In September 2025, NextDecade made a positive final investment decision on Train 4, fully funding it along with its related infrastructure and issuing a full notice to proceed to Bechtel Energy. Train 4 is supported by long-term sales agreements with ADNOC, TotalEnergies and Aramco. Completion and first delivery are anticipated by late 2030. Similarly, in October 2025, NextDecade approved Train 5’s development and funding. Train 5 is backed by agreements with JERA, EQT and ConocoPhillips, and is expected to be operational by early 2031. Both trains have estimated project costs of $6.7bn each, covering engineering, procurement and construction costs, owner expenses, contingencies, financing fees, construction interest and other related outlays. With a total potential liquefaction capacity of around 48mtpa currently under construction at Rio Grande LNG and space for up to ten trains on-site, NextDecade aims to become one of the largest LNG export companies globally.

Title: Strategy buys $264m Bitcoin during price dip as investors brace for 80% government shutdown chance
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/strategy-buys-usd-264-million-bitcoin-during-price-dip/

About us Copy link The threat of a US government shutdown isn’t scaring Michael Saylor. Strategy purchased another $264 million in Bitcoin, the firm announced Monday. The digital asset treasury led by Saylor now holds about $63 billion worth of the top crypto, at an average purchase price of $76,037 per Bitcoin. Strategy’s latest haul comes as investors brace for a likely US federal government shutdown. Democrats threaten their Republican peers with a national gridlock in response to multiple deadly shootings in Minneapolis by federal agents. Following nationwide protests and international condemnation, Senate Democrats have vowed to block a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Prediction market Polymarket now shows an 80% chance for a federal shutdown, which is bad news for asset markets like crypto and stocks. The record 43-day government shutdown in October and November severely damaged investor sentiment as key US agencies responsible for data and oversight were left “flying blind,” the White House said. Bitcoin and other cryptos are still down over $1 trillion since peaking in October. The looming shutdown also lands as President Donald Trump’s abrasive strategies that target key American allies and trade partners have driven investors to dump exposure to the US. The greenback is down about 15% against the euro over the past year. Meanwhile, safe-haven asset gold has enjoyed a meteoric rise, breaching $5,100 per ounce on Monday. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold” by Saylor, isn’t enjoying the same shine. To be sure, the uncertainty is not stopping Wall Street from pushing deeper into the digital assets industry. On Monday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed to launch a second Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund that would give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency — along with a little yield. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has seen massive success since its launch in 2024. It is the largest crypto-focused ETF, holding Bitcoin worth nearly $70 billion, according to DefiLlama data. Strategy shareholders are encouraged to tune into the firm’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call on 5 February. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent. Got a tip?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. More than three decades ago, the legendary Warren Buffett returned a call to a fact-checker, explaining what he meant when he used the term “elephant-bumping affairs." Buffett was gently deriding talkathons such as the World Economic Forum (WEF) and CEO summits hosted by business magazines. I was then working for Fortune magazine in New York and was the fact-checker Buffett called. I couldn’t help smiling as he remarked that these summits were where large egos went to bump into others of their tribe. That early lesson from a man who was a role model of self-deprecating humility for me made me sceptical of Davos, where the WEF holds its annual huddle. This was only heightened when I attended the WEF’s satellite summits in India and China. These reinforced what Buffett said, but with a corollary: Such events make it possible for busy people to take a brief holiday while seeming busy. But, this year’s WEF was different. There was plenty of news, ranging from US President Donald Trump’s disavowal of the use of force to take over Greenland to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s overpraised speech calling out US hegemony. There has been a change, of course, in leadership at the WEF itself with the resignation last April of founder Klaus Schwab after whistleblowers reportedly accused him of research manipulation and financial impropriety. Schwab and his wife were cleared of the charges, but Larry Fink, BlackRock founder and WEF co-chair, now seems in control. Fink mused about moving it from Davos to Dublin or Detroit. Surely Delhi, at least in the interest of alliteration, deserves to be on that list, but he only mentioned Jakarta in Asia. At the centre of this circus, inevitably, was Trump. He walked back his threat to invade Greenland and impose higher tariffs on Nato allies opposed to that idea. Davos and its aftermath are all about predictions, so let me make one. January 2026 will be remembered as the point when Trump’s authority started to unravel. The term TACO (‘Trump Always Chickens Out’) has never seemed more apt. He tends to change tack when the US stock market tumbles, which appeared to be the proximate cause for his rollback of outlandish tariffs announced on Liberation Day in April as well as his decision to sound more conciliatory on Greenland. Machiavelli’s much quoted line that a ruler is better feared than loved might have to be reworked for the Age of Trump. Like the MGM lion that roars at the start of a film from this studio, Trump often comes across like a parody US president, adapted for the small screens of smartphones. While the hypocrisy of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was at least once dressed up with highfalutin talk about installing democracy, US attacks on Nigeria and Venezuela in January came without much attempt at justification. Subsequent meetings in the White House with oil majors to coax them to invest in Venezuela only underlined that this was a resource grab. The chief of Exxon, however, termed the country “uninvestable." January does not just mark the first anniversary of the most tumultuous US presidency ever, but also a rise in TACO readings, with many arguing that the words of a leader who made his name as a TV show host are mostly bluster. Overshadowed at Davos by Trump and Carney was Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. He referred to US-China trade talks as a prime example of cooperation and called for fair treatment of Chinese companies overseas. This is rhetoric more muted than the bluster from the US, but even more potent. Ahead of lecturing Davos about middle powers needing to stand up to the US hegemon, Canada’s Carney had reached an agreement with Beijing that involves slashing tariffs for the first 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) sold in Canada from 100% to 6%. This week, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is slated to visit Beijing to put UK-China relations on a different path. Perhaps major middle powers such as Canada, the UK and even India should read closely the details of China’s current five-year plan; Beijing seeks to dominate the commanding heights of green technology such as batteries and EVs, while ceding little space to developing countries to build market share in low-end electronics, toys and garments. China’s share of global container shipments reached 37% for the first three quarters of last year, while its trade surplus for the full year hit $1.2 trillion. Its response to US tariffs has been to decimate manufacturing in developing countries. The head of an industry body in Jakarta estimated that the textile sector alone in Indonesia had lost 300,000 jobs to cheap Chinese imports. The trouble is that Trump’s mostly successful attempt to control the news cycle pushes China’s hegemonic behaviour to the sidelines. Robin Harding, Asia editor of the Financial Times, spent time in Beijing in November asking economists and business leaders what the world could sell China. The answers were mostly patronising. Soyabeans and iron ore, said one. Higher education said another, but only because Peking University and Tsinghua are hard to get admission to. Unable to think of much else, they suggested that Europe allow Chinese companies to set up more factories there. This attitude of ‘What’s mine is mine and what’s yours will be mine’ should be condemned, but don’t expect to hear that at Davos. The author is a former Financial Times foreign correspondent.

Title: Bitcoin is now cheaper on Coinbase compared to Binance, and the culprit may not be “weak US demand”
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/?p=516588
Time Published: 2026-01-27T10:49:11Z
Full Content:
The index compares BTC/USD vs BTC/USDT, so USDT parity, funding, and offshore leverage can mechanically deepen discounts. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Coinbase's Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below competing exchanges this week, and the gap continues to widen. CoinGlass reported on Jan. 26 that its Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which tracks the price difference between Coinbase's BTC/USD and Binance's BTC/USDT, turned sharply negative, indicating Bitcoin trades at a discount on the largest US venue compared to offshore competitors. The move arrives as US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.1 billion in outflows last week and broader risk appetite weakened, raising questions about whether American institutional demand is cracking or whether something messier is happening in crypto market plumbing. The answer is likely both, and the distinction matters because a persistent discount reveals more than sentiment, exposing constraints in how liquidity moves between venues, how ETF flows translate to spot execution, and whether arbitrage infrastructure can keep markets connected during stress. CoinGlass documents its premium index as the price difference between Coinbase Pro and Binance, with a negative reading meaning Bitcoin is cheaper on Coinbase than on Binance. The index is not purely a demand gauge, as it measures the spread between a USD-denominated venue and a USDT-denominated venue, which introduces mechanical effects from stablecoin deviations, funding conditions, and offshore leverage dynamics. The baseline interpretation treats widening negative premiums as evidence of relatively stronger sell pressure or weaker bid depth on US-linked venues compared to offshore markets. However, cross-exchange price deviations can persist for days or weeks even in liquid markets, reflecting genuine segmentation rather than pure supply-demand shifts. Research on crypto price formation documents large recurring gaps driven by transfer frictions, compliance barriers, credit limits, and inventory constraints that prevent arbitrage from closing dislocations instantly. The question is not whether selling exists, as it always does, but why cross-venue arbitrage failed to compress the gap and what that reveals about stress in financing, settlement infrastructure, or risk appetite. When US spot Bitcoin ETFs record net outflows, authorized participants and market makers adjust hedges and liquidity provision, which can translate into net spot selling or reduced bid depth. Coinbase serves as a primary liquidity venue for US institutional crypto infrastructure, handling custody for over 80% of Bitcoin ETF issuers, and BlackRock materials reference Coinbase Prime as an affiliate of the iShares Bitcoin Trust custodian. That embedded role means ETF redemption activity can route through Coinbase-linked execution pathways more directly than through offshore venues. Farside Investors data shows multiple days of sizable outflows from US-traded Bitcoin ETFs over the past week, totaling over $1.3 billion. The timing correlation is suggestive but not definitive, as most US spot Bitcoin ETFs use cash creations and redemptions rather than pure in-kind transfers, which introduces latency between ETF share flow and spot execution. The pattern resembles a symptom of balance sheet tightening. When ETF flows wobble and macro risk appetite weakens, US-linked liquidity providers pull bids faster than offshore leverage unwinds, creating transient but persistent discounts. The premium becomes a real-time gauge of whether institutional appetite is keeping pace with supply. And, right now, it suggests US bids are stepping back. The index structure introduces a second mechanical driver: because Coinbase trades against USD and Binance against USDT, any deviation in the USDT/USD rate affects the calculated premium even if spot demand is identical across venues. Kaiko has documented episodes in which USDT rapidly flips between discount and premium during market stress, driven by stablecoin supply constraints, offshore funding conditions, or perp market basis dynamics. If USDT trades above parity, then BTC/USDT prices appear optically higher, mechanically worsening Coinbase's discount even if no additional selling occurs on Coinbase itself. Perpetual swap markets compound this effect. Funding rates are mechanically linked to spot-perp basis calculations. When funding turns negative or compresses, the relationship between USD and USDT venues can dislocate as traders adjust hedges venue-by-venue based on margin requirements and collateral preferences. This channel doesn't invalidate the demand interpretation, complicating it instead. A widening discount can simultaneously reflect US spot selling pressure and offshore stablecoin microstructure stress. When the CME Bitcoin futures basis compresses, and perpetual swap funding turns negative or flat, spot becomes the fastest hedge leg for traders unwinding positions. CF Benchmarks notes that the CME basis is strongly tied to sentiment shifts and momentum regimes, and that basis compression often coincides with risk-off moves. If basis and premium both deteriorate simultaneously, that alignment points to a broader de-risk environment rather than an isolated US weakness. In frictionless markets, a Coinbase discount should attract buy-on-Coinbase, sell-offshore arbitrage until the gap closes. Persistent widening implies something is constraining that flow: balance sheet limits, compliance frictions, transfer costs, volatility risk, or simply that arbitrage capital is deployed elsewhere. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. Academic work on crypto arbitrage documents large recurring deviations and meaningful market segmentation, with price gaps persisting longer during sell-offs when liquidity deteriorates, and risk limits tighten. Kaiko research discusses fragmentation-driven dislocations that flare during stress periods, noting order book depth can thin asymmetrically across venues. If Coinbase's bid depth shrinks relative to Binance's, discounts persist even if arbitrageurs recognize the opportunity, because executing large size becomes prohibitively expensive or risky. The most actionable signal is not that selling exists but that market connectivity is degrading. When institutional flow turns negative, financing signals deteriorate, and arbitrage can't close gaps, the combination indicates genuine stress rather than routine volatility. The first foreseeable scenario is a reversion, in which ETF flows stabilize or turn positive, risk appetite recovers, and the premium mean-reverts to zero. This path depends on macro stabilization and renewed institutional appetite, which aggregators' data can confirm day to day. If outflows stop and inflows resume, arbitrage capital returns, and discounts naturally compress. The second scenario involves persistence, with the premium remaining negative as ETFs continue bleeding and macro conditions remain risk-off. Rallies become fragile because the US bid depth never fully recovers, creating resistance at higher price levels. This regime favors patient sellers over momentum buyers and keeps volatility elevated. Microstructure shock scenario: USDT/USD dislocates sharply, funding regimes shift abruptly, or a venue-specific event introduces new frictions. The premium becomes noisy and less interpretable as a pure demand signal, with larger intraday swings driven by offshore stablecoin dynamics rather than spot flows. Coinbase's widening discount functions as a symptom dashboard rather than a single diagnosis. It reflects US-linked net selling and weak bids when ETF flows are negative, but it also reflects USD-versus-USDT plumbing stress and constrained arbitrage capacity. All three dynamics intensify during risk-off regimes, making the premium a composite signal of institutional appetite, stablecoin microstructure health, and market connectivity. The forward-looking question is whether arbitrage infrastructure can keep pace with institutional flow shifts. If ETFs continue bleeding while arbitrage remains constrained and financing conditions tighten, the discount becomes a leading indicator of liquidity fragmentation rather than a lagging indicator of sentiment. The difference matters because fragmentation persists longer and resolves less predictably than simple supply-demand imbalances. For now, the widening gap suggests US balance sheets are tightening faster than offshore leverage is unwinding, and that market plumbing is struggling to keep prices in sync. That combination doesn't guarantee further downside, but it does indicate the infrastructure needed to absorb selling pressure or sustain rallies is operating under stress. And stress, once embedded in market microstructure, tends to linger even after headlines improve. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Forget the Bitcoin price, several specific stress signals are the only thing standing between stability and chaos. While Bitcoin still wears the long-term crown, the "grandpa metal" has quietly generated 84% more wealth over the last five years. As shutdown risk elevates, Bitcoin traders brace for ETF outflows and potential data blackouts. ZachXBT's theft allegations cast doubt on US government's ability to securely manage vast Bitcoin holdings. For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, price appreciation is no longer reliably associated with rising on-chain adoption. His first official WEF slot since Binance’s 2023 settlement and his 2025 pardon wasn’t forgiveness. It was institutional necessity.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. No matter how you slice it, it's been TrumpWorld in the stock market so far in 2026. Seemingly every day, the president is doing something new to stir up volatility in various asset classes and stock-market sectors. We here at First Trade have been breathlessly covering every twist and turn, dissecting the winners and losers of Trump's ever-changing focus. That's why the arrival of this week is good news for anyone looking for a fresh set of catalysts. While there's always a chance that Trump stirs up more price swings, investors will — at a minimum — have some additional macro and company-specific material to sink their teeth into. Here are the two main events to watch, and the market significance of each. This gathering of central bank leaders will take on a slightly different tone than the last few. There's no "will-they / won't-they" drama around interest rates. Investors see a 97% probability of rates staying unchanged. Nothing to see here. What traders will be keyed in on, however, is anything Fed Chair Powell might say about his long-running conflict with the president. Powell has grown more aggressive in his pushback as his term nears an end, especially after the Fed was recently served with subpoenas, Market significance: For their part, investors have fought back against incursions on Fed independence the only way they know how: by dumping US stocks and bonds (aka "selling America.") They know, after all, that even Trump is sensitive to movements in both. (TACO trade, anyone?) If Powell remains defiant, that could keep the Sell America trade going. Specifically from a stock perspective, his resistance to cutting rates sooner than later could be a drag on equities. If he takes a more conciliatory approach, that could be seen as stabilizing for the market. This week is a veritable who's who of tech earnings, with four of the Magnificent 7 reporting over the course of two days: Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla on Wednesday, and Apple on Thursday. Market significance: For Meta and Microsoft, people will be closely watching for signs that massive AI investment is starting to pay off on the earnings front. Last quarter, investors rebelled against big spending plans for both companies, pushing both stocks sharply lower. The message was sent: they want results, and quickly. It'll be the same deal this quarter. Apple, meanwhile, will live and die by iPhone sales, although it's also crossed into the AI realm by partnering with Google's Gemini to power its new Siri tool. Investors will be listening for an update on that partnership. Tesla's part in the AI race is mainly focused on self-driving cars, and traders will be hungry for guidance. Those self-driving ambitions have kept the stock's valuation afloat, even amid a global EV-sales slowdown. Jump to

Title: What to expect from January's Fed meeting as Powell faces looming DOJ probe

It's the first Fed day of 2026, and Chair Jerome Powell is in the hot seat. The central bank announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, as was widely expected. The meeting follows weeks of political pressure from the Trump administration and a recently announced Department of Justice probe. Business Insider will be covering projections from economists, the Fed decision, and market moves all day. Check back here for updates. With the first Fed meeting of the new year in the books, here's what caught our attention: Read full story The FOMC will meet again on March 17 and 18 to determine the next interest rate move and share economic projections, including where members expect interest rates to fall by the end of the year. Powell has two more meetings left in his term as chair. Powell had one big piece of advice for his successor: "Stay out of elected politics. Don't get pulled into elected politics. Don't do it." He added that "It's a regular, affirmative obligation for us to go to Congress and talk to people. If you want democratic legitimacy, you earn it in interactions with our elected overseers. You need to work hard at it. And I have worked hard at it." Powell reflected AI's impact on the job market — and it could be good news for workers. "Every technological wave will eliminate some jobs and create other jobs. It's always been the case. If you look back, wave after wave after wave, there will be some disruption. But ultimately, technology increases productivity, which is the basis for rising wages. It may not all happen immediately, but over time, it's what enables incomes to rise," Powell said. Powell did not answer a question on the Fed chair race and whether he plans to collaborate with his successor. In the December meeting, he gave a different answer to a similar question: "I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape," he said. "I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place." After dodging an initial question about the retiring North Carolina senator's pledge not to vote for Trump's Fed nominees while the DOJ investigation continues, he answered a follow-up on political interference in monetary policy. "The point of independence isn't to protect policymakers," Powell said, arguing that it's intended to keep the central bank focused on the economy. After dodging an initial question about the retiring North Carolina senator's pledge not to vote for Trump's Fed nominees while the DOJ investigation continues, he answered a follow-up on political interference in monetary policy. "The point of independence isn't to protect policymakers," Powell said, arguing that it's intended to keep the central bank focused on the economy. "Every advanced economy, democracy around the world has come around to this common practice. It's just an institutional arrangement that has served the people well. That is, to have a separation, to not have direct elected official control over the setting of monetary policy," Powell said. He noted that monetary policy could be used to affect electoral outcomes, and said that it would be "hard to restore the credibility of the institution" if the Fed's neutrality from political independence is lost. Powell said there was "broad support" on the FOMC for holding today, including among non-voters. Though "there are different views on the committee" over which side of the dual mandate — stable prices and maximum employment — takes priority when data is ambiguous. He said that the majority of tariff impacts have moved through the economy, and trade policy is a reason why inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal. If consumer prices begin to ease, or if job market challenges improve, it might call for looser policy. Powell said the Fed is well-positioned to balance its dual mandate and "the economy is growing at a solid pace." He said "inflation performed as expected" and there are some optimistic signs in the labor market, even if hiring remains low. But he made no promises on future rate cuts. "Policy is not on a preset course," he said. "We're making decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis." He said policy is currently neutral or somewhat restricted. "It's in the eye of the beholder," he said. Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet's senior economist, said the latest decision means the Fed views the job market "as cool, but stable," so they can now focus on the stubborn inflation rate that remains above the Fed's target. "If the labor market data indicated convincing or inevitable weakness, they'd cut, but that simply isn't the case," Renter said.

"If the labor market data indicated convincing or inevitable weakness, they'd cut, but that simply isn't the case," Renter said. Kay Haigh, global cohead of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said "moderation in inflation allows for two further 'normalization' cuts" to bring rates back to where the Fed thinks they won't overheat or excessively cool the economy. However, if the Fed continues to hold rates steady in the months ahead, it could mean consumers don't see relief for a while. "Given the likely pause in further interest rate cuts, consumers waiting for further interest rate reductions before purchasing vehicles or homes, or refinancing existing higher-rate mortgages, will likely need to wait a bit longer," said Charlie Wise, senior vice president of research and consulting at TransUnion. The US dollar has weakened over recent days, but Powell said it's "not appropriate" for Fed leaders to comment on markets or currency. "We do monetary policy and some other things but we don't comment on the dollar," he said. The first question in the press conference was on Powell's recent visit to the Supreme Court in the Lisa Cook case. While he said it's not okay for him to respond to comments from political officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, he said it was the "most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history," so he felt it was appropriate to attend the oral arguments. He said he was "not going to expand" on his video statement on the DOJ investigation and did not confirm if the Fed has responded to grand jury subpoenas. Powell said he "didn't want to get into" his future at the central bank when asked about remaining on the FOMC through 2028. To open the press conference, Powell said the economy is "coming into 2026 on firm footing." The Fed is focused on its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, he said, and the US employment rate has seen "some signs of stabilization." He said that consumer sentiment is "resilient," though job gains have remained low, the housing sector is "weak" and the recent government shutdown weighed on economic activity. The economic situation is becoming more balanced, but there is still a decline in labor force growth due to low demand and declining immigration. This calls for steady rates, he said. The Fed may be holding rates steady, but the central bank did make a notable change to its economic picture this month. In Wednesday's news release, FOMC leaders removed the phrase "downside risks to employment rose in recent months," which has been included in almost every release from the past few months. The committee said that job gains remain low and inflation is still somewhat elevated, but removing the "downside risks to employment" phrase from the Fed's economic assessment is good news for job seekers. It means Powell and company see a labor market in recovery. Powell will begin the Fed's January press conference at 2:30 p.m. He will give an overview of the current economic situation, including the inflation and employment data the Fed is closely watching. The central bank chair will then take questions from journalists. We expect Powell will be asked about the DOJ probe, ongoing political pressure from the Trump administration, tariffs, the impact of AI on the job market, and more. Powell's answers could foreshadow future monetary policy and plans for his final months at the Fed. Major indexes were flat after the Fed opted to keep interest rates unchanged. "Focus, naturally, now turns to Chair Powell's press conference," wrote Michael Brown, senior strategist at Pepperstone. "Powell will likely, again, note that the FFR is now within a reasonable range of estimates as to where the neutral rate may lie, though will probably steer well clear of any questions on his plans post-May, or on ongoing attempts to erode the Fed's policy independence."

The S&P 500 was in the red after the decision, reversing an earlier rally that had brought the benchmark index above 7,000 for the first time ever. The committee has had a split on interest rates at every meeting since July — and this month is no different. Ten FOMC members, including Powell, voted in favor of the hold, but there were two dissents. Stephan Miran and Christopher Waller preferred a quarter-point cut. The Fed will hold its benchmark interest rate steady between 3.5 and 3.75%, in alignment with expectations. The move breaks a pattern of rate cuts over the past several months. Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET to discuss. Central bank decisions trickle down to consumers through mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, and savings accounts. The borrowing rates for these typically follow the same pattern as the Fed. Higher interest rates can help curb rising prices, but still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes over time. It's unlikely Americans will feel the impact of a single rate call, but sustained cuts or hikes can have an effect over time. The typically uniform Fed has been increasingly divided in its decisions. At the December meeting, the FOMC had its most split call since September 2019 with three dissents. Recent Trump appointee Stephen Miran repeatedly voted for steeper rate cuts last year. Others, like Jeffrey R. Schmid, urged a more cautious stance. It's possible that January's rate call will be another split decision for the committee. Top contenders to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder, Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Rieder is leading prediction markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is in charge of the process, though any nominees are likely to hit roadblocks in Congress over the DOJ probe. "The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed," Elizabeth Renter, the senior economist at NerdWallet, said. "A Fed that is vulnerable to political pressure is one that will struggle to be effective at guiding economic stability." Read full story Trump has been vocal about his desire for lower interest rates, threatening to fire Powell and dubbing him with the moniker "Too Late." The president told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that he hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on monetary policy. "I'm a smart voice and should be listened to," he said. Trump added in his Davos speech that he's interviewing potential Powell successors: "Everyone that I interviewed is great. Everyone could do, I think, a fantastic job," he said, continuing, "It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad, sort of disloyalty." Stocks were steady ahead of the rate decision and Jerome Powell's press conference. The S&P 500 pulled back from its record above 7,000 as the tech-led rally stuttered. Markets will be listening closely for updates from Powell on where he sees interest rates going through the rest of his term, but also any clues that could hint at what his successor might do. "Markets expect Chair Powell to end his leadership term without cutting rates again. They also believe that his successor will be similarly cautious, with heavy odds (+70 percent) that Fed Funds will be within 25 basis points of 3.0 percent in December 2027," wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, on Wednesday. Both the DOJ probe and Cook case have sparked widespread concern over the Fed's future, as the bank has long operated as independent and nonpartisan. Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors.

Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors. "We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell," the letter from global bank leaders read. "The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve." The Trump administration accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud in August and attempted to fire her, though she has remained in her seat. Her case was heard by the Supreme Court last week, and several judges expressed disagreement with the White House. "Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve," said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee.

Powell attended oral arguments for the case in support of Cook, but did not give testimony. The DOJ probe around Powell's testimony about the Fed renovations is ongoing. Markets and political leaders will be watching Powell's comments in this afternoon's press conference closely. Beyond posting the uncharacteristic video message online to announce the subpoena, he hasn't spoken publicly about the investigation. The effective import tariff rate has spiked to the highest in decades. Experts have been keeping an eye on just how much tariffs have affected inflation. Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said it's challenging to know the extent to which tariffs have had an effect because there are other headwinds, such as supply chain and inventory issues. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said tariffs had some effect on goods inflation, but hadn't resulted in a massive surge.

US stocks cruised to records at the open on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 hitting 7,000 for the first time ever. Traders were bracing for the Fed decision, as well as critical earnings updates from mega-cap tech. Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft are due to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Markets are broadly expecting to rates to remain unchanged today. The CME FedWatch Tool shows 97% odds of the target rate remaining in the range of 3.5-3.75%. Views on Wall Street are also mixed on whether the market can expect one or two cuts in 2026. US stocks cruised to records at the open on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 hitting 7,000 for the first time ever. Traders were bracing for the Fed decision, as well as critical earnings updates from mega-cap tech. Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft are due to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Markets are broadly expecting to rates to remain unchanged today. The CME FedWatch Tool shows 97% odds of the target rate remaining in the range of 3.5-3.75%. Views on Wall Street are also mixed on whether the market can expect one or two cuts in 2026. Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management, said, "we expect just one rate cut for 2026, and while the timing of this next rate cut is debatable, it will likely come towards the second half of the year" with a new Fed chair. Fed members can look back at last year's inflation to inform their coming interest rate decision. The inflation rate, based on the consumer price index, ended 2025 lower than it started but remained above the Fed's 2% target. The year-over-year percent change in the shelter index continued to cool from its 2023 peak. The unemployment rate has been at least 4% since June 2024, and ended 2025 at 4.4%. This is historically low, but it comes alongside limited vacancies, low hiring rates, and a decline in the number of Americans quitting their jobs or changing roles compared to a few years ago. Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said last year's job market ended "with a fizzle rather than a bang." The US added 584,000 jobs in 2025, the lowest since 2003, outside recessions. Economists and job-market experts told Business Insider that the job market was in a low-fire, low-hire environment, partly due to economic uncertainty and reduced demand after the pandemic recovery and the Great Resignation. It's likely Fed leaders will stick to the status quo in January, in hopes that steady rates will push inflation closer to their 2% goal. Affordability is a major concern for American households, as prices rise on housing, groceries, healthcare, and more. Powell has consistently prioritized price stability during his time as chair. The Fed is expected to cut rates at least once later this year, a move that could ease costs for borrowers and juice the job market. Powell's term as chair ends in May, but he's eligible to remain on the Fed committee until early 2028. It's rare for former chairs to stay on as governors, and Powell has not indicated his plans. But there's been some speculation from Wall Streeters that Trump's threats to the Fed could entice Powell to remain at the bank longer than expected. The DOJ probe news sparked alarm among politicians, economists, and business leaders, many of whom are concerned about the future of the central bank. Powell's term as chair expires in May, and Trump is set to announce his next pick for the role in the coming weeks. Both Democratic and Republican leaders have signaled the probe jeopardizes the search for Powell's successor.

Both Democratic and Republican leaders have signaled the probe jeopardizes the search for Powell's successor. "If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none," North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said, adding that he will oppose any Trump nominees to the central bank until "this legal matter is fully resolved." With around 7.5 hours until the Fed's latest rate decision is announced, things are a bit of a mixed bag in financial markets on Wednesday. As of 6:30 a.m. ET futures for the three major US indexes are trending higher, with the Nasdaq leading the way, signaling a nearly 1% rise at the open. That's due in large part to its tech focus, with many of the biggest tech firms reporting earnings this week.

Elsewhere, futures for the S&P 500 are 0.4% higher, while the Dow Jones is up less than 0.1%.

Gold's record rally is continuing on Wednesday, with the precious metal extending its gain by another 3% to trade just under $5,300 per ounce. Silver is also higher, gaining 5.4% to trade at $111 per ounce. Powell posted a video message on January 11 announcing that the Fed received a grand jury subpoena. The Trump administration alleges that Powell committed perjury during a June appearance before Congress, where he discussed renovations to the central bank's Washington, DC, buildings. Business Insider obtained a letter Powell privately sent to senators detailing the Fed's construction plans and budget — the details of which match his testimony. Powell said that the probe, which could result in a criminal indictment, is an escalation of ongoing pressure from the White House.

"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president," he said. The Federal Open Market Committee has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. Fed leaders opted for three quarter-point cuts last fall after months of steady monetary policy. The White House and investors are hopeful for a looser approach to interest rates in 2026. But Powell is in a tough spot: Lower rates could speed up a slow job market, but risk a rise in inflation.

Title: Nvidia’s Rally Shows DeepSeek Fears Were Unfounded a Year Later

A year ago, the Chinese startup DeepSeek freaked out the stock market with the idea that developing artificial intelligence was much easier and cheaper than everyone imagined. But 12 months later, that’s turned out to be largely a mirage so far. DeepSeek erased a record $589 billion from Nvidia Corp.’s market value in one day after the company revealed an AI model thought to be comparable to those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. and developed at a fraction of the cost. Nvidia’s double-digit plunge led the S&P 500 Index 1.5% lower, while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 Index shed 3%. Even energy and utilities stocks like Vistra Corp. and Constellation Energy Corp., which benefit from the technology’s buildout, sold off. Just 24 hours later, though, Nvidia shares rebounded, erasing some its losses as investors rushed to buy the dip. Over the following days and weeks, investor concern waned as reports showed that DeepSeek’s model wasn’t as much of a competitive threat as first feared. “The initial reaction was ‘oh my God, this could be done way cheaper and these companies are in trouble, and Nvidia’s not going to be able to sell these expensive chips,'” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance. “Here we are a year later and that’s just obviously not true. Nvidia’s growth rate continues to just defy all logic.” Shares of Nvidia, which contributed to the lion’s share of the S&P 500’s advance in 2025, are now up 58% since the DeepSeek selloff. There was a “massive overreaction” to DeepSeek, said Google DeepMind Chief Executive Officer Demis Hassabis, at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, where the debate over whether China is a threat to tech in the US percolated. Even Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek “AI’s Sputnik moment” last year. The knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek was a stark reminder of an investing tenant: Innovation is ever-present and can quickly change the course of the market, especially when it comes to nascent tech. “Technology moves incredibly fast,” said Eric Gerster, chief investment officer at AlphaCore Wealth Advisory. “One has to be a little bit nimble.” One of the key fears raised by DeepSeek was that the billions of dollars in capital expenditures pledged by hyperscalers would be cut, hampering growth at Nvidia and other companies associated with building AI. Instead, spending has soared, with Meta, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. expected to deploy roughly $475 billion for capital expenditures in 2026, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Though investors have largely cheered rising capex budgets, there are worries about bottlenecks hindering development and the possibility of an overbuild. Investors have become sensitive to deals between AI companies that appear circular in nature, and especially skeptical that OpenAI, a private company, will be able to spend the more than $1 trillion they’ve committed to building AI infrastructure. But, so far, the sheer amount of money being spent building data centers to get more computing power has helped the AI trade broaden beyond just chipmakers. Last year, memory stocks including Sandisk Corp., Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, Western Digital Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. were the S&P 500’s biggest winners. Energy, utilities, materials and industrial sectors also got a lift as investors looked for ways to invest in AI outside of large-cap tech companies. Memory stocks have continued to outperform so far in 2026. AI Evolution While it’s become clear that Nvidia’s graphics processing units still dominate the market, there’s a place for custom-made chips and more general purpose processors. That has helped other companies claim a stake. For example, Alphabet’s tensor processing unit, or TPU, chips have been an upside catalyst for its shares because of their use within the company and the potential that they could be sold to third parties. Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and even Intel Corp. have also seen shares rise over optimism for their chips. “DeepSeek was able to show there’s different, equally effective ways of using these artificial intelligence models that don’t necessarily mean you have to have the fastest and newest chips,” said Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. “What we’ve seen is just more of an evolution, and we would expect that to continue at this point.” While the AI boom remains strong, some of the biggest winners from the tech — the Magnificent Seven group of stocks — is down about 0.3% this year, with Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta and Amazon shares in positive territory. That’s not a death knell for the AI trade, according to Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at Spear Invest. The companies with the brightest outlooks for profit growth are now tied to infrastructure, she said. The AI “trade is still on, I’d compare it more to an industrial revolution,” Delevska said. “It’s impacting the entire market.” Top Tech Stories Photograph: The Deepseek logo; Photo credit: Raul Ariano/Bloomberg Related:

Asian shares have mostly gained after U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday after U.S. stock indexes ticked upward, buoyed by strong profit reports for some companies. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to 53,333.54. The Kospi in South Korea surged 2.7% to 5,084.85, even after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on South Korean goods because the country’s national assembly has yet to approve a trade framework announced last year. South Korea’s presidential office responded after a meeting of top officials that it will convey its commitment to implementing last year’s deal to the U.S. The presidential office said that South Korea’s Industry Minister Kim Jung-Kwan will travel to the U.S. for talks with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, while Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo will travel separately to meet with Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Kim was on a visit to Canada. Trump said on social media Monday that import taxes would be raised on autos, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs from South Korea with the rate on other goods going from 15% to 25%. Gains for Korean tech-related shares like Samsung Electronics, which rose 4.9% and chip maker SK Hynix, which soared 8.7%, helped offset losses for automakers. Kia Corp. fell 1.1% and Hyundai Motor Co. lost 0.8%. Chinese markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3% to 27,106.83 and the Shanghai Composite index added 0.2% to 4,139.90. But the benchmark for the smaller market in Shenzhen dropped 0.1%. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.8%, while India's Sensex edged 0.1% higher. The future for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1% lower. On Monday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, winning back its losses from last week’s dip to close at 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6% to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.4% to 23,601.36. Financial markets could face more swings in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its stance on interest rates on Wednesday, when it is expected to hold steady. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver earnings reports. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In Monday trading, Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, helped by strong demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. But Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. In other dealings early Tuesday, the price of gold resumed its climb, adding 0.2% to $5,089.70 per ounce. On Monday, it rallied 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time. Silver lost 2.6%. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The dollar rose to 154.56 Japanese yen from 154.20 yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1873 from $1.1881. U.S. benchmark crude oil gave up 25 cents to $60.38 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 30 cents to $64.47 per barrel. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Bitcoin: Can Asia catch up as U.S. BTC ETFs control global liquidity?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-can-asia-catch-up-as-u-s-bitcoin-etfs-control-global-liquidity/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T06:45:31Z
Full Content:
U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now drive crypto liquidity and sentiment, while Asia’s policy-constrained market lags. Asia’s crypto ETF market remains developing rather than mature, despite early progress. Hong Kong leads the region, launching Asia’s first spot for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs in 2024. By the end of Q3 2025, AUM had reached roughly $920 million before moderating to about $340 million in spot BTC ETFs in January 2026. This showed that growth is stronger in percentage terms, yet scale remains limited. Meanwhile, the monetary authorities of Singapore, Japan, and South Korea remain cautious. As a result, Asia competes conceptually but not yet structurally, positioning itself as an emerging, policy-driven follower rather than a global ETF leader. Japan lags materially. The Financial Services Agency is targeting spot Bitcoin ETFs no earlier than 2028, with legislation planned for 2026 to reclassify crypto as “specified assets,” emphasizing custody and investor protection. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs decisively outperform their Asian counterparts in scale, liquidity, and market influence. As of late January 2026, the United States market holds roughly $118-120 billion AUM and over 611,000 BTC, while Hong Kong remains constrained near $250-340 million. Source: CoinGlass This disparity reflects faster U.S. regulatory execution, deeper capital pools, and highly efficient creation-redemption systems. As a result, issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity dominate flows, supported by authorized participants that convert ETF demand directly into spot BTC buying or selling. Source: CoinGlass As a result, U.S. ETF inflows often reinforce bullish momentum, while sharp outflows amplify downside moves, shaping sentiment and price discovery across crypto markets. Asia’s ETFs largely track price passively, whereas U.S. products actively transmit macro signals, institutional positioning, and risk sentiment into Bitcoin’s short-term movements. This dynamic cements U.S. ETFs as the primary drivers of global crypto liquidity and market psychology. Over the weekend, Bitcoin dipped toward the $86,500–$87,000 zone, while gold and silver rallied to new highs above $5,000/oz and $100–110/oz. This divergence underscored risk-on versus safe-haven dynamics amid rising macro uncertainty. The Bitcoin pullback reflected ETF-related fragility layered on broader risk-off forces, not an isolated ETF shock. Source: X However, yen strength, U.S. shutdown risks, and defensive positioning remained the primary drivers. ETFs amplified volatility but did not initiate it. Globally, U.S. ETFs dominate activity, while Hong Kong products stay largely inactive. All in all, U.S. ETFs dictate global crypto liquidity and sentiment, while Asia remains policy-constrained and macro forces continue to dominate short-term market direction. Moreover, macro forces ultimately determine the direction of short-term cryptocurrency.

Who Needs Sports? The Washington Post is bracing for massive layoffs that have employees questioning owner Jeff Bezos’s commitment to the newspaper’s long-term health, Status reports. WaPo reportedly plans to slash 100 of its 800 newsroom positions next month, with the cuts likely to primarily impact the sports, metro and foreign news teams. In total, 300 positions may be eliminated across the company. Why the layoffs? WaPo’s advertising and subscription businesses have been struggling for years. WaPo infamously lost a quarter million digital subscribers, or 10% of its subscriber base, after Bezos spiked the paper’s planned endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election. As of June, its paid print circulation was just 97,000. On top of that, Johanna Mayer-Jones, WaPo’s ad chief, was reportedly eyeing an exit back in October – although she’s still currently with the company. The decision to focus newsroom layoffs on the sports desk bodes ill for WaPo’s turnaround prospects. Its major news rivals, including The New York Times, have doubled down on sports as a way to attract advertisers that are hesitant about appearing beside hard news coverage. Oh, and the layoffs are expected to hit just as the Winter Olympics are set to begin in February. Stock In Trade The Trade Desk is dealing with all sorts of in-the-weeds programmatic drama. There’s its fierce rivalry with Amazon putting pressure on margins, not to mention in-fighting with Prebid over transaction IDs. But there’s another issue: TTD’s leadership churn. Programmatic vets surely took note of Jud Spencer’s departure in December and CRO Jed Dederick’s exit not long before that. Meanwhile, the COO role was unfilled for years before Vivek Kundra came aboard last year. And there hasn’t been a CTO since Dave Pickles left in 2023. Now, Alex Kayyal, who joined as CFO only six months ago, is stepping down, Adweek reports. TTD also had another CFO transition 18 months prior. The Trade Desk’s CFO turnover may not ring all that loudly in the programmatic space, but Wall Street investors consider it an important signal. And, indeed, TTD’s shares dropped by more than 6% after the announcement. In a research note, Wells Fargo wrote that the news about Kayyal only adds to TTD’s “continued fundamental and narrative volatility.” Losing the narrative, as they say, barely registers in third-party programmatic. Favorable headlines about Amazon DSP can stack to the sky without much affecting TTD’s actual performance. But when the Wall Street narrative breaks, it goes straight to the market cap. The Ads Add Up Few places are pricier to run ads than the Las Vegas Sphere or during an NFL game – unless, apparently, you’re buying a placement in ChatGPT. That’s right. Scarcely a week after OpenAI announced its plan to launch ads in the coming weeks, ChatGPT has reportedly set a baseline CPM of approximately $60, according to The Information. That price rivals some of the most coveted inventory out there. Sixty bucks would be at the high end for a YouTube campaign, while CPMs on Meta, by comparison, are often in the $10 to $20 range. And OpenAI doesn’t even have an attribution or a pixel network to track and credit conversions. On the other hand, recall that Netflix launched with a $60 CPM baseline, which has long since rationalized to $30 or less. Being among the earliest advertisers in ChatGPT will no doubt carry some bragging rights, sure. Just imagine all the screenshots and organic sharing those ads will generate. Still, The Information writes, with OpenAI’s ads business in its infancy, “many advertisers will likely hold off on devoting significant parts of their budgets to ChatGPT ads until they see whether those ads are driving sales.” Not everyone is willing to shell out for a shiny object. But Wait! There’s More! Inside the debate over agentic advertising and standards. [Digiday] How MrBeast Burger, the YouTuber’s eponymous food and delivery brand, went so very wrong.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: The Trade Desk’s CFO search indicates a tough road ahead for independents

Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → After a rocky 2025, ad tech entities, particularly “independents,” are taking measures to steady the ship in the coming 12 months, with the exit of The Trade Desk’s CFO (its second in six months) the most high-profile example. Earlier this week, The Trade Desk announced the exit of Alex Kayyal, the demand-side platform’s finance chief who has been in role since August 2025 and served on its board from the February prior to that, topping off what’s been a tumultuous 12 months. The Trade Desk’s chief accounting officer Tahnil Davis will serve as interim CFO, while the search for a more permament replacement is conducted. The termination of such a senior executive after a short time in office raises questions – NewStreet Research’s Dan Salmon has a concise analysis – with The Trade Desk’s share price plunging 5% in the early hours after the January 2026 announcement. The departure also echoes similar moves from other DSPs, including layoffs at challengers in the sector such as Yahoo in earlier months, with sources telling Digiday the moves were signs of a financially challenging 2025 for the sector. A November survey from Digiday Research noted the marked rise of Amazon’s DSP, with the results showing that decline of The Trade Desk – dropping from 55% in Q1 2024, to 29% Q3, 2025 – contrasting with the rise of the e-commerce giant’s fortunes – shooting up from 29% to 50% during the same period. Of course, the rise of Amazon contrasting with the rocky fortunes of independent DSPs helps resurface “the Open Internet vs. Wall Gardens” debate, although, a report released this month point to a wind in the sail of the latter. According to a report from Winterberry Group, which characterizes the following 12 months as one of “continuous evolution” as opposed to runaway growth or sudden contraction, with advertising spend projected to grow to $664 billion in 2026, up 9.4% year over year when political advertising is included. However, in a market that is stabilizing after several years of volatility, while also undergoing structural change driven by AI, marketers are being asked to “do more with the same,” per Winterberry’s researchers. All of this means performance advertising will likely be marketers’ cause célèbre in the months ahead as their peers in the finance department ask for immediate results for their marketing investment, making the jobs of sales staff at platform-providers – read Amazon, Google and Meta, etc. – equipped black boxes primed to take further advantage. “According to a reputable leaker on TeamBlind; the layoffs are pushed right one day- i.e. 28 JAN 2026 [sic] is purportedly the new day. Everything else should be consistent/correct.” — As Amazon is expected to follow up on its series of 2025 layoffs, reputedly preparing to cut 30,000 jobs, ahead of its Feb. 5 earnings call, one anonymous source forecasts the precise date the axe will fall. Bold Call: OpenAI’s ads pivot may come too little, too late OpenAI is set to wade into the advertising business this year, but its move to finally monetize ChatGPT with ad dollars may have come a touch too late. The top AI platforms for publishers, ranked Two years after OpenAI signed its first content licensing deal with Axel Springer, the field of AI platforms doing business with publishers has expanded exponentially. Especially just in the past year. OpenAI CFO defends ads in ChatGPT as ‘strong business model’ OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar defended the company’s addition of ads to its popular chatbot ChatGPT as a way to democratize access to artificial intelligence, while speaking at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. YouTube is reaching a ‘tipping point’ in convincing advertisers it really is TV A research study released this month by Pixability found that in a survey of 288 media agency professionals, finding 62% of US agencies and 85% of UK agencies plan to include YouTube in their CTV ad buys this year. Performance Max beta enables advertisers to split-test assets Google is testing the ability for advertisers to split-test shopping ads, specifically for creative assets in Performance Max campaigns. Amazon opens ‘Prebid Adapter’ beta, seeks to bridge ad demand Amazon has moved its Publisher Services (APS) “Prebid Adapter” into beta on Wednesday, making it available in GitHub. Publishers want the Competition Markets Authority to impose harder structural remedies on Google regarding its AI crawler vs. behavioral ones.

Title: BlackRock Files Bitcoin Premium Income ETF: What It Could Mean For BTC

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock has filed an S-1 for an “iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF,” a product that aims to track bitcoin’s price while generating option premium by systematically selling calls tied primarily to its own spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT. For BTC-linked derivatives markets, the filing is being read less as a directional catalyst and more as another potential source of mechanical volatility supply. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas flagged the document on X, noting that key commercial details are still missing. “BlackRock just dropped the official S-1 for it’s upcoming iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF.. no fee or ticker yet,” Balchunas wrote. “The strategy is to ‘track performance of the price of bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options primarily on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on ETP Indices.’” BlackRock just dropped the official S-1 for it’s upcoming iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF.. no fee or ticker yet. The strategy is to “track performance of the price of bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options… pic.twitter.com/CZDahm4mNj — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 26, 2026 The basic premise is familiar to anyone who has watched covered-call equity ETFs: sell upside to monetize implied volatility. In bitcoin’s case, the underlying options are written on an ETF wrapper rather than directly on BTC, but the economic effect is similar, steady call overwriting can increase supply of short-dated upside exposure and compress the premiums available to sellers over time, particularly if multiple products pursue comparable programs. That dynamic was the focus of commentary from Wintermute’s head of OTC trading, Jake Ostrovskis, who framed the filing as additive to an already crowded volatility-selling landscape. “BTC vols already suffer from significant oversupply following the rollout of ETFs, SP’s & options on IBIT,” Ostrovskis posted. “Now add more mechanical vol selling and the only logical outcome is further steady decline in yield from market-implied premiums.” The implication is not that bitcoin’s price must fall because a premium-income ETF exists, but that the “income” component could become harder to sustain at attractive levels if implied volatility continues to be leaned on by systematic call sellers. In that world, headline yields may drift lower, and the payoff profile becomes increasingly path-dependent, premium capture in quiet regimes can look reliable, but it can also leave investors structurally underexposed to sharp upside moves if BTC trends higher through the strikes being sold. For market participants trying to extract option premia from BTC exposure, Ostrovskis argued the edge shifts away from simply being short vol and toward execution and distribution. “Structuring/timing + leaning on axes via OTC desks will become increasingly important to optimise returns on otherwise dormant assets,” he wrote, pointing to the growing role of bespoke structuring, strike selection, tenor management, and liquidity access as the trade becomes more crowded. If BlackRock proceeds and demand materializes, the next question for traders will be how much incremental call supply the strategy represents relative to existing IBIT options activity and whether that supply concentrates in specific expiries or strikes. Either way, the filing underscores a broader maturation trend: as BTC exposure becomes more ETF-native, the center of gravity for volatility pricing may continue to migrate toward the wrapper’s options market, with implied premiums increasingly shaped by systematic flows rather than discretionary views.

Title: From marginal experiment to global market infrastructure: Tokenization is rewriting finance
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/from-marginal-experiment-to-global-market-infrastructure-tokenization-is-rewriting-finance/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T04:00:41Z

Tokenization is reshaping finance by modernizing market infrastructure without altering legal classifications. Laura Estefanía, Founder & CEO of Conquista PR, advises Web3 companies on media strategy and crisis communications. She leads communications at Asecrypto, Spain’s top crypto association, and speaks globally on tech, AI, and Web3. The following is a guest post and opinion from Laura Estefania, Founder and CEO of Conquista PR. The past decade of digital assets has been shaped as much by debacle as by innovation. High-profile collapses, sensational headlines, and regulatory whiplash distorted public perception, leaving technologies capable of modernizing global finance viewed through a lens of suspicion. Beneath that noise, however, tokenization has quietly crossed an irreversible threshold. As recent analysis by Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein makes clear, tokenization is no longer an experiment. It is becoming part of the underlying infrastructure of financial markets. The constraint today is not technological maturity, it is perception. Tokenization is edging closer to becoming a mainstream capital raising tool. The efficiency gains and benefits of broader access are simply too big to ignoreIssuers in growing economies have an unrivaled opportunity to boost market inclusion through blockchain-native capital raises.” Perception in finance shapes real outcomes. It influences capital formation, informs regulatory posture, and determines whether institutions feel confident enough to integrate new systems. The problem is not that tokenization lacks technical readiness. The problem is that it is still being judged through the legacy optics of past crypto excesses. In finance, perception becomes a gating mechanism. It defines what decision-makers feel allowed to deploy. Tokenization does not expand the regulatory perimeter or rewrite who may invest in which instruments. Securities laws, investor classifications, and jurisdictional restrictions remain firmly in place. What changes is the infrastructure through which compliant participation is executed, monitored, and scaled. Tokenization tends to improve: Tokenization does not automatically change: Fractional ownership is not a legal breakthrough. Corporate equity has always been divisible, and debt has long been issued in varied denominations. The limiting factor has been operational, not conceptual. Traditional market plumbing makes granular participation inefficient due to: By recording ownership as a verifiable digital entry that can move at the speed of information, tokenization removes friction. What was legally permissible but economically impractical becomes viable at scale. Major asset managers are already building regulated tokenized products and settlement rails, including initiatives tied to BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. None of this is speculative or ideological. It is infrastructure improvement. Yet tokenization is still evaluated through the afterimage of prior market failures, where retail speculation and platform collapses dominated the public story. That misalignment risks slowing adoption precisely where tokenization offers measurable benefits: lower costs, faster settlement, and greater transparency. The consequence is simple: institutions hesitate, even when the technology is ready and the use case is already regulated. Outside the West, tokenization is often less a theory and more a practical response to structural friction. In many emerging markets, the challenge is not replacing a highly efficient banking system, it is compensating for one that can be fragmented, slow, and expensive to access. Common pain points include: Tokenization does not remove regulatory constraints, but it can reduce operational frictions that inflate the effective cost of capital. Faster settlement, transparent ownership records, and programmable compliance reduce reliance on intermediaries, allowing global liquidity to reach local projects with fewer layers of cost and delay. This dynamic is discussed in broader regional adoption research, including the Milken Institute’s coverage of Sub-Saharan Africa’s digital asset landscape here. In the U.S. and Europe, regulatory attention remains heavily oriented toward classification and containment, even as stablecoins and tokenized government securities already move significant value across borders. Institutions run pilots, then pause. Not because the tech fails, but because reputational risk and public perception still blur “market infrastructure” with “speculative activity.” Citi, for example, projects that tokenization of financial and real-world assets in private markets alone could reach the trillions by 2030. Yet many institutions still treat tokenization as optional experimentation rather than inevitable modernization. This is not merely a communication problem. It is a competitive one. Jurisdictions that assess tokenization through efficiency, risk management, and capital flow optimization are pulling ahead, while others preserve complexity the rest of the world is actively designing around. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. For a discussion of how major institutions approach on-chain experimentation, see CryptoSlate’s coverage here. Tokenization does not need evangelism. It needs comprehension, and regulators willing to judge financial infrastructure by outcomes rather than optics. Under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Europe has prioritized standardization. MiCA does not regulate tokenized securities, those remain governed by existing capital-markets law. Instead, it sets rules for crypto-assets that fall outside traditional financial regulation, including governance, disclosure, and reserve management for certain on-chain settlement instruments. That clarity improves institutional readability, which is a prerequisite for banks, asset managers, and custodians to engage at scale (MiCA text and implementing materials can be accessed via EUR-Lex). Rather than a single pan-regional framework, Gulf jurisdictions have emphasized structured rollout: sandboxes, phased licensing, and regulator-led pilots that move tokenized deposits, funds, and payment instruments from proof-of-concept to production. You can see examples of this regulatory posture through bodies such as ADGM and the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority. Different strategies, same logic: Emmanuel Givanakis, CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) in October 2025 said: The FSRA continues to enhance its digital asset regulatory framework to remain forward-looking and responsive to the next wave of financial innovation, including tokenization, DeFi and AI-driven market participation. Our approach balances innovation with strong governance, risk-based supervision, and alignment with global standards. We are committed to enabling digital asset firms to scale within a well-regulated international financial centre that prioritises transparency, resilience, and long-term stability. Tokenization becomes operationally powerful because it replaces fragmented legacy workflows with a single programmable ledger. In practice, this can mean: What was always legally possible but operationally inefficient becomes feasible at scale. Finance is being rewired in parallel across regions that rarely move in sync. The technology is mature, demand is visible, and regulatory pathways are no longer hypothetical. What has changed most decisively is not the code, but the context in which it is now understood. Tokenization is moving out of yesterday’s headlines and into the domain of policy, prudential supervision, and institutional balance sheets. Once tokenization is understood as infrastructure, the burden of proof reverses. The question becomes not whether it belongs in the financial system, but how efficiently it can be deployed, supervised, and scaled. If you only read one section, read this: Tokenization’s formative debate is ending. What follows is an execution phase, defined less by ideology and more by governance, interoperability, and speed. The markets that recognize this earliest will not merely adopt tokenization, they will help define how global finance operates in its next iteration. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. DTCC and Nasdaq still need nightly pauses, while crypto perps never close. And they’re already absorbing real price discovery. T+0 is the kind of plumbing change that decides whether tokenization stays a pilot or becomes the market.

The Federal Reserve is expected to pause its interest-rate-cutting cycle this week, as a more stable jobs market eases divisions within the central bank. Officials believe current rates are appropriately positioned to support employment while keeping inflation in check. This decision aims to refocus on the Fed's core mandate, though it may intensify criticism from President Trump.

Title: S&P 500 wins back all losses from Greenland dip, gold and silver surge even higher
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/26/how-much-did-market-go-up-today-gold-silver-why/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T23:43:35Z
Full Content:
U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Monday, while other markets made louder moves, including another record-breaking rush for the price of gold. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and won back its losses from last week’s dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 313 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The energy technology company said it’s benefiting from strong momentum in demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.62 points to 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 313.69 to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 100.11 to 23,601.36. The action was stronger in the gold market, where the metal’s price rallied another 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time to set another record. Silver surged even more and settled 14% higher. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The latest worry to pile atop the swelling list was President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods from Canada if it signs a free trade deal with China. The U.S. dollar’s value also continued its recent slide against peers. Last week, it was U.S. tariff threats related to Greenland that drove some global investors away from the dollar. This time, it was the Japanese yen leaping sharply because of expectations that officials in both Japan and the United States may intervene in the market to prop up the Japanese currency’s value. More swings could be ahead for financial markets in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates on Wednesday. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Most economists expect it to hold steady on Wednesday, in part because inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Whatever the Fed decides, comments from its chair, Jerome Powell, following the decision could sway stock and bond markets. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver their latest earnings reports this week. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.21% from 4.24% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements in Europe following some sharper swings in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% for one of the world’s bigger moves. A stronger yen could hurt Japanese exporters, and Toyota Motor fell 4.1%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: Inside an Anxious Washington Post, With Eyes on Jeff Bezos | Analysis
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/washington-post-layoffs-jeff-bezos/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T21:48:32Z
Full Content:
Rumors of cuts to the international, metro and sports desks are leaving journalists “twisting in the wind” and prompting unusually public appeals to ownership As the Washington Post newsroom braces for layoffs, journalists took their case public on Monday, turning to social media to urge mega-billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to support the paper’s robust and storied foreign coverage. “Hi @JeffBezos,” Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O’Grady wrote on X. “We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team ‘badass beacons of hope.’ We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost.” Correspondent Yeganeh Torbati, who covers Iran for the paper, also tweeted directly to Bezos, saying she wants “nothing more than to keep doing this important work,” while White House bureau chief Matt Viser wrote that “it’s impossible to overstate how much we rely upon” the international desk and “how diminished we’d be without them.” The public appeals on Monday speak to fears inside the paper that significant cuts are on the horizon — particularly in international coverage — and reflect growing doubts about whether Bezos, the Amazon founder reportedly worth around $250 billion, remains fully invested in supporting the paper. The Post, which reportedly lost around $100 million in 2024, went through a painful round of buyouts last year, and staffers worry that further cuts at the start of 2026 could deepen the turmoil at a time when rigorous coverage of global conflict and crisis feels more essential than ever. [Layoffs will] reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” In conversations with TheWrap, staffers expressed frustration with Bezos’ seeming distance from the paper, as well as with CEO and publisher Will Lewis, whose widely touted “third newsroom” initiative never gained traction amid broader upheaval during his two-year tenure. They also fault management for the loss of hundreds of thousands of subscribers after the paper spiked a 2024 endorsement of Kamala Harris. “If their answer to those losses is to take it out on staff now, what are we doing?” asked a staffer. “The lack of communication has left folks twisting in the wind,” another staffer told TheWrap, adding that “many people aren’t sure if they’ll have jobs next week.” The Post’s precarious state contrasts sharply from a decade ago, when it was among the standout publications during Donald Trump’s first term, with the paper, under then-executive editor Marty Baron, landing major scoops and adopting the motto “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Even as the Post continues to deliver dogged coverage of Trump’s second administration, Bezos’ cozier relationship with the president and his remaking of the opinion section around “personal liberties and free markets” have raised concerns about whether he remains as committed to holding the administration accountable. It wasn’t lost on staffers that Bezos didn’t publicly comment on the FBI’s search of a Post reporter’s home earlier this month, even as he found time to tweet about Polymarket. At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios reportedly paid $40 million for the licensing rights to a new Melania Trump documentary — which was screened Saturday night at the White House — while Amazon is among the corporate donors to Trump’s ballroom project. Foreign correspondents pleaded with Bezos over the weekend, urging him in a letter to “preserve our newspaper’s global coverage.” They reminded Bezos how he told staff, upon buying the paper in 2013, that being “profitable and shrinking” is “a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.” A third staffer told TheWrap, “If Bezos cares a little bit about this newspaper, and wants this paper to get back to the golden days under the leadership of Marty Baron, then he needs to make changes at the top.” Foreign reporting has long been one of the Post’s hallmarks, stretching back to Pulitzer Prize-winning work by the likes of David Remnick and the late Anthony Shadid, and extending to more recent coverage of ISIS, the Israel-Hamas war, Ukraine, Iran and Venezuela. That legacy is now colliding with deep uncertainty inside the newsroom, where rumors swirl that not only foreign coverage, but sports and metro desk teams are on the chopping block. Potential layoffs on the international desk are particularly unnerving, not only because of the Post’s legacy, but because some foreign journalists rely on the paper for U.S. visas — or to continue reporting from the countries they cover. Proud to be colleagues with fearless @washingtonpost international reporters. @JeffBezos, their work is absolutely core to the newspaper and vitally important to my own job covering the White House and foreign policy. #SaveThePost https://t.co/Q7im59ol9o Foreign correspondents have been told not to travel to crisis zones after Feb. 1, which fueled speculation that management wants U.S.-based staff at home ahead of potential layoffs next month. On Friday, the Post also abruptly canceled plans to send a contingent to cover the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games, which kick off on Feb. 6. Though the specter of layoffs has loomed for some time, “cutting Olympics coverage at the last minute did shock a lot of staff,” the second staffer told TheWrap. “It all feels more serious and urgent now.” TheWrap learned Monday that the Post now plans to send four journalists to the games, as opposed to the more than a dozen originally expected. A Post spokesperson confirmed the Olympics plan. “Perhaps the cuts aren’t as bad as rumored,” added the second staffer. “But if they are, it’ll reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” Turning out the lights on ambitious, hard-hitting international coverage would give a stark new meaning to the Post’s long-standing warning that “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Corbin Bolies contributed reporting for this story.

By Ted Johnson Political Editor Staffers at the Washington Post have started to post messages on social media to “Save The Post,” amid fears that the Jeff Bezos-owned publication is on the cusp of implementing massive layoffs. A number of foreign correspondents posted messages Monday as speculation swirled that the international coverage will bear a substantial amount of cuts. A sample: Correspondent Yeganeh Torbati wrote on X, “@jeffbezos I cover Iran for @washingtonpost. Since June, I’ve reported on US/Israeli strikes, a dire water crisis, state coercion of the private sector, and now, horrific govt violence against protesters. I want nothing more than to keep doing this important work.” Correspondent Loveday Morris, who covers the Middle East, wrote, “Today a source warned me that my reporting lines could have me killed. Just an average day as a foreign correspondent. I can’t count the number of times I’ve come under fire or had windows rattle from blasts. Our international staff risk so much to bring home news.” Related Stories News Fox News Marks Milestone As It Tops January Ratings, While MS NOW And CNN See Viewership Gains Politics Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Leguizamo, Constance Wu & More Set For 'People's Filibuster' Anti-ICE Protest The New York Times reported that foreign correspondents sent a letter to Bezos, urging him to retain the coverage. Watch on Deadline The Post has not commented on pending layoffs. “We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and lose relevance,” the correspondents wrote. “… The newsroom depends on our authority, cultivated through face-to-face source meetings around the world — work that simply cannot be replicated from Washington.” There also has been concern about the sports staff at the Post after a memo, obtained by Semafor, went out from Managing Editor Kimi Yoshino informing them that a contingent would not be sent to cover the Winter Olympics next month. A Post spokesperson confirmed a Times report that, in a reversal, a smaller contingent would be sent. The Post has already gone through multiple rounds of job cuts and buyouts in recent years, a contrast from years of growth after Bezos bought the publication in 2013. The Post suffered from a loss of subscribers following Bezos’ decision to nix an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race. He later shifted the strategy of the opinion pages, leading to an exodus of editors and columnists. The Amazon founder said that the opinion content would focus on the “defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.” “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos wrote.

Title: Valour wins FCA approval to offer Bitcoin, Ether ETPs to UK retail investors

The rollout comes as UK regulators reopen the retail market to crypto-related products and global issuers expand regulated offerings. Cointelegraph in your social feed Valour, the UK subsidiary of digital asset company DeFi Technologies, has begun offering crypto exchange-traded products to UK retail investors on the London Stock Exchange following recent regulatory changes. In a Monday notice, DeFi Technologies said the products are being offered in line with new FCA guidance allowing retail access to crypto exchange-traded products tied to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The offerings, called 1Valour Bitcoin Physical Staking and 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking, began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday. “The UK is one of the world's most important financial markets, and these approvals broaden our ability to serve UK retail investors with transparent, exchange-listed products that provide straightforward exposure to the evolving digital asset economy,” said Johan Wattenström, DeFi Technologies chairman and CEO. The company announced in September that it would list a Bitcoin staking ETP on the London Stock Exchange, but this was limited to professional investors, in contrast to Monday’s offering, which was targeted to UK retail investors. The FCA lifted a ban on crypto ETPs for retail investors in October, prompting offerings from asset managers such as Bitwise. The move by Valour builds upon the company’s efforts in Brazil, where it launched an exchange-traded product tied to Solana (SOL) in December. Cointelegraph reached out to Valour for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication. Related: Solana enters Brazil’s main exchange as Valour expands regulated crypto access According to the London Stock Exchange, more than 50 issuers list more than 2,300 ETPs. The exchange reportedly recorded about $280 million in trading volume for crypto ETPs in December. CoinShares reported on Monday that exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies saw more than $1.7 billion of outflows last week. The company’s head of research, James Butterfill, attributed the change from $2.2 billion of inflows the previous week to “dwindling expectations for interest rate cuts, negative price momentum and disappointment that digital assets have not participated in the debasement trade.” Some of the largest asset managers offering crypto ETPs and exchange-traded funds include Grayscale Investments, Fidelity Investments and BlackRock.

Title: VanEck expands crypto ETF lineup with spot Avalanche product

The newly launched fund offers exchange-traded exposure to AVAX as other proposed Avalanche ETFs remain under regulatory review. Cointelegraph in your social feed Global asset manager VanEck has launched a US-listed exchange-traded product offering exposure to Avalanche’s native token, AVAX (AVAX), marking the first spot Avalanche ETF to trade in the United States. According to Monday’s announcement, the product is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, though it may be subject to other US securities laws. The fund will trade under the ticker VAVX, tracking the price of Avalanche’s AVAX token and potentially generating returns through staking. VanEck said it will waive sponsor fees on the ETF’s first $500 million in assets through Feb. 28. Assets over $500 million before Feb. 28 will be charged a 0.20% sponsor fee, which will apply to all assets after that date. Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at VanEck, told Cointelegraph that the ETF wrapper opens access to the RIA and wealth management market, as well as for institutions to capture “network yield through a standard exchange-traded product without the risk or complexity of managing the infrastructure themselves.” Avalanche is an open-source blockchain network for decentralized applications and smart contracts that went live in September 2020 and is developed by Ava Labs, a startup founded by Cornell University computer scientist Emin Gün Sirer. AVAX had a market capitalization of $5.1 billion at the time of writing and was trading at $11.76. The token is down about 92% from its November 2021 all-time high of $144.96 and about 69% over the past year, according to CoinGecko data. VanEck first sought to launch an Avalanche ETF in March 2025, when it filed an S-1 registration statement with US regulators. In April 2025, Nasdaq followed with a rule-change filing requesting approval to list and trade the proposed Avalanche ETF, a required step before the product could come to market. The fund’s launch may pave the way for additional Avalanche spot ETFs that are already in the regulatory pipeline. Grayscale Investments currently operates an Avalanche trust and filed in August 2025 to convert the product into a spot ETF, while Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 registration for an AVAX spot ETF in September 2025. Related: US Bitcoin ETFs bleed $1.72B in five-day outflow streak According to an X post from Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, on Monday BlackRock filed an S-1 registration statement for its proposed iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, which seeks to track Bitcoin’s (BTC) price while generating income by selling call options primarily on shares of its spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. The filing reflects a broader shift in crypto exchange-traded products, as issuers increasingly design ETFs that combine digital assets with portfolio strategies and risk management features rather than offering simple price exposure alone. In December, Amplify ETFs launched two blockchain-focused ETFs on NYSE Arca. The Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) track diversified indexes of companies building infrastructure and generating revenue from stablecoins and tokenized assets. Bitwise Asset Management also filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch 11 single-token “strategy” crypto ETFs, a move that would expand its product lineup by offering regulated exposure to major altcoins including Near (NEAR), Sui (SUI), Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Bittensor (TAO) and Zcash (ZEC). Asset manager 21Shares recently launched its Bitcoin Gold ETP, BOLD, on the London Stock Exchange, offering a single exchange-traded product that combines exposure to Bitcoin and gold, with roughly two-thirds allocated to gold and one-third to Bitcoin and trading in both pounds sterling and US dollars.

Title: BitMine Makes Largest 2026 Ethereum Purchase, Hits 3.52% Supply

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BitMine Immersion Technologies executed its largest 2026 Ethereum acquisition, purchasing 40,302 ETH and pushing its holdings to 4.24 million tokens valued at $12.05 billion. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) acquired 40,302 ETH last week, marking its biggest Ethereum ETH $2 999 24h volatility: 0.4% Market cap: $362.27 B Vol. 24h: $23.24 B purchase in 2026 as the company accelerates toward owning 5% of total supply. The firm now holds 4,243,338 ETH, valued at $12.05 billion, representing 3.52% of Ethereum’s 120.7 million token supply, according to its January 26 announcement, and it’s confirmed by Coingecko data. BitMine remains the world’s largest corporate Ethereum treasury, a position it has held while executing an aggressive accumulation strategy throughout 2025 and into early 2026. The company’s total crypto and cash holdings reached $12.8 billion, including 193 Bitcoin BTC $88 933 24h volatility: 0.2% Market cap: $1.78 T Vol. 24h: $45.98 B , $682 million in cash, and $219 million in strategic investments, based on its press release. 🧵BitMine provided its latest holdings update for January 26th, 2026: $12.8 billion in total crypto + "moonshots":– 4,243,338 ETH at $2,839 (@coinbase)– 193 Bitcoin (BTC)– $200 mllion stake in Beast Industries @MrBeast – $19 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: $ORBS)… — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) January 26, 2026 In the company’s press release, they add selected nine positive mentions of different global leaders like Donald Trump and the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, about digital assets, showing a positive sentiment around crypto, like Ethereum at the World Economic Forum in Davos, prompted Lee to state, “Ethereum remains the most widely used by Wall Street today and most reliable blockchain with zero downtime since inception”. This new acquisition follows BitMine shareholders’ January approval to increase authorized shares with 81% support, enabling continued treasury expansion. Also, the company has staked 2,009,267 ETH, worth $5.7 billion, generating an estimated $374 million in staking fees annually at the 2.81% Composite Ethereum Staking Rate (the average yield across major staking providers). The company plans to launch its Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) staking infrastructure in Q1 2026 to enhance returns. NYSE American-listed BMNR stock traded at $28.63 on January 26, fluctuating between $27.60 and $28.74 during the session with an average volume of 44 million shares, according to Yahoo! Finance. The stock maintains its position as the 91st most actively traded in the US, averaging $1.2 billion in daily volume over the past five days, despite lacking much upward momentum in 2026. BitMine’s purchase led, again, the trend of corporate Ethereum accumulation in 2026, with Hong Kong-based Trend Research acquiring 41,500 ETH for approximately $126 million using decentralized borrowing through Aave, rather than traditional equity sales. The BitMine strategy positions it nearly 70% toward its goal of controlling 5% of Ethereum’s supply, as the corporate Ethereum treasury trend accelerates in early 2026.

BlackRock wants to expand its Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings. The world’s largest asset manager has filed an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a new “iShares Bitcoin Premium Income” ETF. If approved, the new product’s assets will consist primarily of BTC, shares of BlackRock’s flagship spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and cash. However, the new ETF would also include an actively managed component, according to the new filing. Explains BlackRock, “The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on indices that track spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products, including IBIT.” The asset management giant says Coinbase Custody Trust Company would serve as the new ETF’s custodian for Bitcoin holdings, with Anchorage Digital Bank available as an alternative custodian. BNY would administer the trust and custody its cash and securities. In addition to IBIT, BlackRock also offers the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which tracks the price of ETH, and the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC), which tracks the investment results of an index composed of firms involved in blockchain and crypto technologies.

Title: Coffee Break: Oracle Debt and TikTok Transition Troubles Vex the Ellison Media Empire
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2026/01/oracle-tiktok-ellisons-finances-debt-media-empire-algorithm.html
Time Published: 2026-01-26T19:00:12Z
Full Content:
Oracle and TikTok are overshadowing the problems at Bari Weiss’ CBS News this week. Larry and David Ellison are attempting to create a massive multi-channel media empire with reach across multiple demographics and the scale and synergy to build something more than the sum of its parts. Larry Ellison’s database behemoth, Oracle, provides the financial foundation beneath the aspiring media empire. TikTok is the shiny new acquisition that gives the Ellisons’ hasbara-enforcing empire its reach into the Zoomer demographic and its algorithmic influence over what that demo sees… and perhaps thinks. Combined with the Paramount TV network and Hollywood studio empire that Père Larry bought for fils David, Oracle’s 15% share in the American version of TikTok was supposed to make the Ellisons kingmakers and resistance breakers. But, as I’ve posted before, empire building ain’t easy. This week, financial problems at the foundational level and technical problems at TikTok are vexing the imperial Ellisons. Ed Zitron Goes for the Kill In the latest premium-subscriber-only edition of his newsletter Where’s Your Ed At?, Ed Zitron argues that “the AI bubble means that every single participant, without exception, is operating on borrowed time.” Most of the issue is spent explaining how doomed OpenAI is, the way GPU accountancy guarantees the hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google) will be facing massive depreciation write-downs (and possibly even impairments) for the foreseeable future, and outlining various scenarios explaining what may happen if and when OpenAI fails. But he saves a big passage at the very end for Oracle. Yet the biggest loser, I believe, will be Oracle – a company saddled with debt and hundreds of billions of dollars of long-term obligations due to its participation in the AI bubble, and a software business that’s rancid and decaying. https://t.co/tAWxEv0NzD pic.twitter.com/fRMEnoE3Lc — Ed Zitron (@edzitron) January 23, 2026 Some key quotes: I cannot express how stupid Oracle is. It signed a $300 billion deal with OpenAI back in September of last year that requires 4.5GW of capacity that Oracle does not have, and has taken on $248 billion in lease obligations on top of it. Oracle does not have the cash to support these operations. It had negative $13 billion in cash flow last quarter, raised $18 billion in bonds, that $38 billion debt package for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin has yet to close, and Blue Owl — the loosest legs in data center funding — pulled out of Stargate Michigan in December, with nobody else stepping up to the plate as of writing this sentence. Here’s the thing: for any of this to work, OpenAI has to become profitable within the space of two years, and do so at a scale where it is able to afford $30 billion or more a quarter in compute costs. To give you some context, Microsoft Azure makes around $75 billion annually, and AWS $115 billion. OpenAI, in its best-case scenario, made around $13 billion this year, and Oracle will be charging it at least $25 billion in the next year if any of this compute is actually made available. … Every quarter, Oracle’s debt expands. It paid $1.057 billion in interest in its last quarter, up from $933 million in the one before, and $892 million the quarter before that. In the middle of 2024 (its Q1 FY2025) — just before NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPUs started shipping — Oracle had $23 billion in PP&E. As of its latest quarter, it had $67.875 billion, likely almost entirely made up of NVIDIA’s GB200 racks, which The Information reported had negative 100% gross margins, specifically on Oracle Cloud. This is not a situation where Oracle “works it out.” GPUs are destroying its gross margins just as its software business begins to contract, and its largest customer for this unprofitable business segment is OpenAI, the company that does not have any money and in fact loses it all. The longer the AI bubble inflates, the more it seems like Oracle is in threat of actually defaulting on its loans and collapsing. This December chart from Manu Invests shows why Oracle is the most vulnerable of the (would-be) hyperscalers: pic.twitter.com/vW8C7nhm9H — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) January 26, 2026 This goes a long way toward explaining the 25% drop in Oracle’s share price over the past six months: pic.twitter.com/4qD57iFm1K — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) January 26, 2026 The financial research and technology platform Trefis tried to explain Oracle’s share-price decline to Forbes readers: Oracle (ORCL)’s stock plummeted by 37% in the last three months, even with a modest increase in revenue and better margins. The reasons for the decline include cautious Q2 earnings, diminished enthusiasm in AI, reductions in analyst price targets, and insider selling—all contributing to a significant drop in investor confidence. What’s truly behind this rollercoaster? … Bears should be warned that financial seer and CNBC talking head Jim Cramer calls Oracle a “linchpin stock” for the AI boom: Jim Cramer: I wanted to be fatuous just in keeping with the news that I read which makes me feel like, are you kidding me? Come on, are you kidding me? Are we really supposed, what are we supposed to sell Oracle off of this? But even Cramer jawboning the stock wasn’t enough to turn the tide. That took some news about Oracle’s 15% share of American TikTok becoming official. Controlling TikTok Bumps Oracle’s Share Price A new internal memo from TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew however, has Oracle shares rising in price today. Key highlights: Today, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC has been established in compliance with the Executive Order signed by President Trump on September 25, 2025, enabling our US users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience. … TikTok’s growth in the US nicely sets up the Joint Venture for strong future success. The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users. It will be led by Adam Presser who, today, has been chosen by the Joint Venture’s Board of Directors for his impressive track record with the company leading large-scale teams in the areas of Trust & Safety and Operations. The New York Times has more details, including who owns how much of this new beast: Investors including the software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm, will own more than 80 percent of the new venture. … Adam Presser, TikTok’s former head of operations, will be the chief executive for the U.S. TikTok. The deal is intended to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States. … Under the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15 percent of TikTok’s U.S. operations. ByteDance will own just under 20 percent. … The majority of the seven-member board for the new U.S. TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees. Mr. Chew has a seat on the board. The new venture will moderate content in TikTok’s feed, deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down. Note that Oracle’s main partners in the new venture are an Emirati investment firm and Egon Durban’s Silver Lake. The UAE Is All-In on Israel’s Hasbara Agenda Forgive me for a brief detour, but it’s important to point out the political and geo-strategic context in which the UAE is a key shareholder in American TikTok. The UAE is currently isolated in the Middle East after falling out with Saudi Arabia. The latter is building a Sunni block that includes “Qatar, Oman, Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan” while the UAE is openly aligned with Israel and India, per the SCMP. The UAE has been pushing reactionary narratives in the west since the end of the Arab Spring, but now it stands exposed as an open ally of Israel. From The Washington Post last week: …the rupture between the two oil-rich monarchies is already rippling beyond Yemen as Saudi Arabia, alarmed by what it sees as aggressive military and foreign policy moves by its much smaller neighbor, works to counter the deep web of influence Abu Dhabi has spent years building in the Horn of Africa and around the Red Sea. … Riyadh’s sudden, more assertive stance has countries in the region trying to navigate the rift. For years, Saudi Arabia and the UAE worked largely in tandem, backstopping other autocrats amid the Arab Spring uprisings and joining forces to counter the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. In recent days, however, Saudi Arabia has shored up other alliances to curtail its rival and is in talks with both Egypt and Somalia to expand security cooperation between the three countries, according to a senior Somali security official. Somalia’s federal government also said it was canceling its defense agreements with the UAE, which maintains commercial ports and military bases in at least three areas — Somaliland, Puntland and Jubaland — where the government in Mogadishu has little presence or influence. … Andreas Krieg, an associate professor at King’s College London’s School of Security Studies, has described the UAE’s regional network as an “axis of secessionists.” “Abu Dhabi is comfortable operating below the threshold of formal statecraft, building influence through a web of commercial vehicles, logistics access, security assistance, intermediaries and local armed partners,” he said. Notably the WaPo piece avoids any mention of the Israeli-UAE alliance. Dr. Krieg spells it out more clearly on his X account: Saudi has convened an impressive coalition of states with immense depth that includes Turkey (who disagree with the UAE over Somalia, Libya and Sudan), Egypt (who see themselves confronted by UAE statecraft in Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya) and the rest of the GCC, plus Pakistan as a… https://t.co/lTJoQ8Lbxi — Dr Andreas Krieg (@andreas_krieg) January 23, 2026 I should also mention that Silver Lake is a primary owner of Ari Emanuel’s WME Group, the company that owns a majority of TKO, parent company of the UFC and WWE. Emanuel played a key role in the Ellisons’ securing Trump’s approval to buy Paramount, and also reportedly helped the Ellisons secure financial backing from the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth funds for Paramount’s (so far) unsuccessful bid for WBD. I doubt that same constellation of investors could be assembled today, after the falling out between the Saudis and the UAE. But let’s get back to TikTok. Adam Presser’s Fight Against ‘Anti-Semitism” Drawing Attention New CEO Adam Presser has been outspoken about his plans for the platform. Here are some key points from Presser’s talk at last year’s World Jewish Congress (via Chris Menahan on X.com) LONG CUT: Adam Presser, TikTok's new CEO under the Larry Ellison takeover, told the World Jewish Congress last year, • They made "Zionist" a "proxy for a protected attribute" to designate it "hate speech" if used in a negative light (the WJC lobbied for this change). • TikTok… https://t.co/TDnsfVvMqn pic.twitter.com/zkaHy7WLCL — Chris Menahan 🇺🇸 (@infolibnews) January 25, 2026 So far it looks like the new moderators are operating with a heavy hand. Here’s how one American alt-media outlet is faring under the new regime: UPDATE: TIKTOK IS COOKED. Our @tiktok_us videos went from tens of thousands to 0. (seemingly a direct result of Trump & Bibi’s friends taking over) pic.twitter.com/XHMR1oW3Yp — The Tennessee Holler (@TheTNHoller) January 26, 2026 Tough Transition It’s not just heavy-handed moderation that’s troubling TikTok’s first days under new management. The Verge headlined their piece on the platform’s issues “TikTok USA is broken.” Key points: Many in the US have found it impossible to upload videos over the last day or so, which are sitting “under review” indefinitely. One video we uploaded from a US account last night has yet to go live, nearly 12 hours later, while a video uploaded from the UK is published — but it’s only visible to our editors who aren’t in the US. Similarly, accounts for pages like the BBC and The Guardian only show new uploads for those of us who live outside the US, while viewing the same account from the US shows only videos uploaded before Sunday morning. Issues that thousands of people have reported and we’ve been able to confirm include difficulty logging in, the inability to upload or publish videos, a For You Page algorithm that isn’t personalized, problems loading comments, as well as errors flashing for other features, and problems with the CapCut video editor. Given the timing, many drew a link between TikTok’s issues, its US operation’s new Trump-friendly owners, and this weekend’s anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, exacerbated by the killing of a second local resident, Alex Pretti, by federal agents. The combination of publishing errors and previously political For You Pages that are suddenly filled with generic content has led many to assume the worst when their videos about ICE wouldn’t publish, but at the moment, the problems appear to be much more extensive. Previously popular TikTok anti-genocide advocate Guy Christensen has been urging his followers to migrate to a new platform called UpScrolled with the sales pitch that “It’s led by a Palestinian and promises no censorship from billionaires.” I have to assume that TikTok will sort out its technical issues, but as with the Ellisons’ CBS News it is unclear if they will be able to create a controlled platform that retains enough popularity to be influential. It also remains unclear what the impact of the much anticipated AI bust will be on the Ellisons’ plans for global info domination. Related Posts: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Just FYI, Oracle also owns and runs Cerner systems. The EHR company. Second only to EPIC in its use in America. Since I am old enough to have used them all in the past, I can very much assure you that it is the biggest disaster in the field. Colleagues who are still forced to use it now have told me that literally it has caused all kinds of mayhem up unto death in its latest configuration. My feeling is that Oracle bought Cerner about 2-3 years ago or something like that. They immediately got the VA involved in their product, and the VA began to have disasters like it has never had before. Am I the only one bothered by the fact that we have these big leviathan like computer companies like Oracle and Amazon ( most all of them are run on AWS in the background) with their mitts all over everyone’s personal data? I am not sure what would happen to the EHR field if something as big as Cerner goes under – but it sure would be fun to watch. Ellison claims that Oracle’s access to private data is its hole card in the rapidly commodifying AI space. I’ll look into Cerner & Oracle’s acquisition thereof. Thanks! Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner in December 2021 with the formal purchase occurring in June 2022…so around 4 years ago. Purchase price was $28.3B. Cerner was based in Kansas City and had a weird office location policy… basically a few large office towers in radically different parts of the KC metro area. They also bounced employees from one location which was a big source of frustration. Now, most of those old office towers are in desperate need of tenants. I’m not in medicine, but I also have heard that Epic is better than Cerner although that might be a low bar to clear. Not sure if you saw OpenAI’s recent ChatGPT health announcement. I believe Anthropic announced something similar shortly after. It will be pervasive. The new season of The Pitt (emerg show) has a commentary on it. I haven’t had first-hand experiences with Oracle’s offerings as much as IBM’s (another company that’s really good at rotting software it acquires from within like a parasitic wasp). What I am specifically familiar with is that, beyond everything else, Oracle has a definite reputation in the open-source community. I think it’s largely from the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, which was probably as close to a spiritual opposite of Oracle as an American software company could be. Funny enough, IIRC it worked out kind of like Oracle’s recent business moves; tons of developers & engineers quickly jumped ship, and core contributors created independent forks of anything Sun had open-sourced (which was much of their IP because that’s how Sun rolled). And a lot of the customer base just went with them. So I totally believe you that Oracle could turn an EMR system into a dumpster-fire in under 5 years. Sun Solaris used to be a big deal but don’t hear much about it these days. I guess Java and Android are kind of joined at the hip, but not sure what that means for Oracle. I feel like a dupe for not knowing this. I work in public health and several of our partner facilities use cerner – and have been, for nearly 2 years now, borderline nonfunctional and mostly noncompliant vis a vis their reporting requirements to the municipal health department. The reps from cerner proper are overwhelmingly useless, although from my perspective it’s hard to tell if that’s a fundamental problem with the product or just those guys in particular – but we don’t have these issues with anyone using epic or in house solutions. Ed Zitron tweeted that Oracle may sell Cerner to pay for AI data centers. TD Cowen had a data center themed analyst letter today that said that Oracle may lay off 20-30,000 people or sell Cerner to keep up with the debt on the data centers it’s building for OpenAI. It also says multiple US banks have pulled back from Oracle data center deals. I’m starting to think of AI as a modern version of the old Golem mythology. per wiki: In modern popular culture, the word has become generalized, and any crude automaton devised by a sorcerer may be termed a “golem”.[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem Steve Balmer once said the great thing about Windows was that you could keep selling the same piece of intellectual property over and over again. You were selling it while still owning it. Louis B. Mayer said the same about the movie business. So isn’t all this investment in energy sucking data center hardware a violation of the grift that made Bill Gates the titan (/s) he is today? Clearly karma tells us that an Ellison bankruptcy is devoutly to be wished–perhaps at the same time that Trump is impeached and Netanyahu ushered into his Israeli jail cell. The difference is MS was selling something with $0 cogs. All the AI people are trying to to sell stuff with massively negative margins. This is why some of us believe in the jolly roger. Perhaps some people will wise up & learn to limit what personal info they put on these platforms; then again… The Ellisons seem to think Robber Baron = Media Mogul They are not the same, supposed “business acumen” does not translate from “regular” business to Media Empire. Rupert Murdoch chased his White Whale of DirectTV for years, and finally caught it. Then the phone hacking case in the UK threatened to take down the whole empire, but as Harry Shearer lampooned on Le Show almost every week during Trump 1.0, Murdoch (allegedly) had a hotline to the White House. Trump has thrown the Ellisons under the bus, not a good look for aspirational Media Moguls, especially when their primary portfolio is upside down. We’ll see how many billions of dollars being a poodle for Israel is worth. How has Trump thrown them under the bus? throwing shade / cold water on the Skydance/WB merger Variety I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine Trump’s kicked them in the teeth multiple times. There’s this gem from my piece last week: Despite Bari and Donald excitedly kissing one another on the cheek when they met at the site of CBS’ interview with the POTUS, the administration threatened to sue the network (again): Moments after President Trump finished taping a 13-minute interview on Tuesday with the “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil in Michigan, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, approached Mr. Dokoupil and his colleagues to convey a message from the president. “He said, ‘Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,’” Ms. Leavitt said in an even tone, according to a recording of the exchange obtained by The New York Times. “Yeah, we’re doing it, yeah,” Mr. Dokoupil responded. Ms. Leavitt replied: “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.’” I’m not sure his actions CBS were suing so much as a shakedown. “Sure you can have your merger but I want a cut. I’ll sue you and you’ll settle for this ampunt and then it can go ahead.” If he is threatening it again he is probably deciding he wants another cut. That’s what happens when you give in to bullies. I am an occasional “user” of TikTok, and the double entendre is intentional given its toxic effect on dopamine. This weekend, it was quite interesting after the murder of Alex Pretti as the for you page knew I was interested in the topic. The quality varied. Today, the for you page has been gutted after I finally accepted the new terms and conditions for a U.S. user. It’s unclear if these are handover snafus or an intentional effort at corporate censorship. Well, the Ellison’s can create a hedge. Set up an industrial bank like Ford and General Motors. Given the infinite malleability of the FDIC, Oracle should be able to finagle guarantees for large portions of its fictitious capital. With Ari Emmanual as one of Donnie’s favored bag-men it should be a slam dunk…only a question of price. Oracle has very deep ties with the state it emerged from, they can do any wrong and will be left unmolested. They certainly own the subsidiary of the the TBlair foundation that is the current government in the UK. OT but does anyone here find that firefox has degraded markedly over the last 3/4 months? “Oracle has very deep ties with the state it emerged from, they can do any wrong and will be left unmolested.” The suite of software marketed by Oracle is now so widely used and so inextricably embedded in the business processes of a myriad of corporations, including many large ones, that the company may be considered Too Big To Fail, leading to the possibility that the State will do everything necessary to keep it afloat in case of a bankruptcy-threatening trouble. A friend is interviewing for a company who provide a SaaS platform for customers dependent on Oracle to point their ERP applications at a new “Oracle” server that is really a open-source DB…. :-) Goodbye Big Red! OT but does anyone here find that firefox has degraded markedly over the last 3/4 months? Not overall but Firefox is not loading some images in a posting. Among others, I have had to move to Opera to load some images in a Simplisimus post. I am not seeing any real pattern but I have not been keeping close track. I’ll have to start. Most of the issue is spent explaining how doomed OpenAI is, the way GPU accountancy guarantees the hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google) will be facing massive depreciation write-downs (and possibly even impairments) for the foreseeable future, and outlining various scenarios explaining what may happen if and when OpenAI fails. Here I see a second layer to the recent DRAM price increases. If OpenAI could likewise restrict the supply of GPUs, it’s possible they or datacenters could artificially raise the prices and argue for appreciation of their assets, to keep the whole gaming going for a few months more. Given the accounting games already being placed in the AI space, I can see something like this coming. They could raise prices to who? AI does not seem to be delivering anything worthwhile beyond the platforms who desire free, ad-fertile content, perverts who can manifest their wildest fantasies and (pace another article here), slothful administrators who somehow feel they fully deserve their place in The Shitshow. An informal collective who are notoriously reluctant to stick a hand into their personal pocket. Good stuff, NWT. I also paused to wonder how many are loudly hyping in the press and to investors, while quietly prepping for something different to happen. I’m going under the idea that if Orace’s dodgy finances blow up in their face, that the US government will ride in to bail them out because they are Too Important To Fail and it is all about national security, dontcha know. What should happen is that entire edifice should be broken up and sold off. Yep thats exactly what will happen. We all know the AI bubble is going to pop and leave a giant mess behind, but I doubt any regular readers here will be shocked when the oligarchs end up being bailed out by the working class yet again. Another way to look at OpenAI is that every company cutting deals with it is fully assuming (or 100% recklessly insouciant) as to its imminent bankruptcy. The counter-parties are in a bidding war with one another for control of the OpenAI estate in bankruptcy and trying to hasten it (before they have to fund their own obligations). MS and Oracle each need an AI stack. Once the VC money dries up and AI providers raise prices for profitability, NVidia could resell the GPUs / datacentres to the survivors. OpenAI is worth more dead than alive to every partner it has. It is turning out like Murder on the Orient Express! When OpenAI dies, Microsoft gets everything, they essentially own all of OpenAI’s IP. @Nat Wilson Turner – interesting article, thank you for writing it but, if one small subedit us allowed, the wonderful Omanis are not Sunnis but Ibadis. They are considered apostates by the Sunnis, just like the Shia are, but the Omanis are polite and humble and Oman is cut off by mountains and sea from the rest of Arabia and so they survive like a Switzerland of the Middle East…. Ah, thanks for pointing that out. My ignorance is as deep as my knowledge base is shallow. If I understand this joint venture correctly, Oracle just paid Bytedance a few billion sheckels to do content moderation on the Tiktok platform? There’s no business there, it’s all loss. This is insane. Accenture, Wipro and the other big IT outsourcing services make billions off Bytedance for doing this in the rest of the world. It’s actually setting money on fire to lock down content that all you need is a VPN to see. Good article, thanks! I would like to add that the spike – up 50% – in Oracle’s stock price came the week after its deal with OpenAI where Oracle will deliver compute it doesn’t have, powered with power it doesn’t have, in exchange for money OpenAI doesn’t have. Mr Market is quick to reward playing into bubbles. Something that I started wondering thinking about Oracle’s debt, and the AI bubble in general: Is this a big part of why Trump wants interest rates down, to keep the AI bubble growing? I have mostly seen speculation on it being his background in property or generally inflating the economy. But he is awfully close to the tech billionaires, and they are probably aware of the need for low interests to blow their tech bubbles. Maybe someone has written about this, and I have just missed it. Or maybe there is some solid reason to think this isn’t the case. Regarding interest rates, agreed. A return to ZIRP would be tossing Ellison a lifeline. Are there dots to be connected here? Pretty much every billionaire would benefit from ZIRP, so there’s probably a line. Adding to the TikTok angle: according to Kyle Kulinsky and Kristal Ball, who tested it, now you can’t do a direct message on Tiktok if it contains the word “Epstein”. Being a nerd, I’ve paid some attention to the WB bidding war. It never made sense to me how Warner Brothers is worth … 100 billion? Really? In this case the Ellison’s may be saved from themselves. Excellent article by the way, it convinced me that we’ll be looking at massive bailouts soon. I wonder if they’ll be public. The Fed will likely engineer what many will consider hyper-inflation in order to bailout the big debtors such as private equity, the tech bros, an so on. What else can they do in order to avoid a economic collapse? Free money is the only way the party can continue. When things get really ugly there may well be a smorgasbord of actions taken – bank bail-ins, quantitative easing, ZIRP, massively expand the Fed’s balance sheet, and the outright theft of other nation states assets – gold, various minerals, oil, USD holdings.

Title: Amazon layoffs to begin tomorrow? Key sectors that could be impacted

E-commerce giant Amazon is planning a second round of layoffs this week, with a broader aim of trimming its corporate workforce by about 30,000, Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. In the second round, the total job cuts are expected to be roughly the same as last year and could start as early as Tuesday, 27 January, the people told the news portal. In October last year, the company cut around 14,000 white-collar jobs, nearly half of the 30,000. Employees in Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and the People Experience and Technology HR units are expected to be affected, the report said. However, the full extent of the impact remains unclear, while Amazon's plans could still change. The Seattle-based retailer giant cited the first round of job cuts in October on the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Later, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, he said, “it’s culture," meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. Jassy had previously stated in 2025 that he anticipated Amazon’s corporate workforce would decrease over time due to efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Major companies are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people, the report said. Amazon touted its latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The entire 30,000 jobs would constitute a small part of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, accounting for nearly 10% of the company's corporate staff. Most of Amazon’s workforce is employed in fulfilment centres and warehouses. It would be the biggest layoff in Amazon’s 30-year history. The company cut around 27,000 jobs in 2022. In October last year, affected workers were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply for internal jobs or seek other employment. That period expires on Monday. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint. Download The Mint News App to get Daily Market Updates.

Title: Commercial Cleaning Services Market Report 2026 - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/26/3225816/28124/en/Commercial-Cleaning-Services-Market-Report-2026-Global-Industry-Size-Share-Trends-Opportunity-and-Forecast-2021-2031.html

January 26, 2026 11:12 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 26, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Commercial Cleaning Services Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Commercial Cleaning Services Market is projected to expand from USD 225.24 Billion in 2025 to USD 336.32 Billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.91%. This sector includes professional maintenance and sanitation for non-residential environments such as healthcare institutions, corporate offices, educational facilities, and industrial sites, covering tasks ranging from standard janitorial work to specialized floor care and regulatory disinfection. Market growth is primarily fueled by rising global hygiene standards and a corporate strategy to outsource facility management for cost reduction and operational efficiency. According to the Building Service Contractors Association International, 34 percent of contractors anticipated significantly higher sales in 2025 compared to the previous year, signaling strong confidence in the industry. However, the market faces significant headwinds due to acute labor shortages and workforce retention issues. The industry is hampered by high turnover rates and challenges in recruiting reliable staff, often driven by wage competition and physically demanding working conditions. This instability restricts service providers' ability to scale effectively and leads to inflated recruitment and training costs. Consequently, the difficulty in maintaining a stable labor pool threatens to reduce profit margins and constrain the broader expansion of the commercial cleaning sector. Market Drivers The deployment of Automated Cleaning Technologies and Robotics has become a vital strategy to address labor shortages and the demand for consistent, high-frequency sanitation. Service providers are increasingly utilizing autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for repetitive tasks such as floor scrubbing, which allows human employees to concentrate on complex, high-touch disinfection while data analytics provide essential performance validation. Highlighting the scale of this integration, Brain Corp reported in December 2024 that its fleet of autonomous robots had cleaned over 250 billion square feet of commercial space worldwide. Simultaneously, a sharpened focus on workplace hygiene and employee wellness is driving market growth as companies implement return-to-office mandates. Facilities are adopting evidence-based hygiene protocols that go beyond visual cleanliness to minimize pathogen transmission and reassure occupants. In March 2025, Cleaning & Maintenance Management (CMM) found that 30 percent of facility managers prioritized employee health safety as a top management concern. This focus translates into financial success for providers offering health-centric solutions; for instance, ABM Industries reported a 6.2 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the third quarter of 2025. Market Challenges The critical obstacle hindering the Global Commercial Cleaning Services Market is a severe labor shortage coupled with the difficulty of retaining a qualified workforce. This operational bottleneck limits providers' ability to meet rising demand, forcing them to decline new contracts or restrict the scope of existing ones, which directly caps revenue potential. Additionally, the perpetual cycle of recruiting and training new personnel imposes a substantial financial burden, diverting capital that could otherwise be invested in business development and innovation. This instability is further aggravated by wage competition and the physically grueling nature of the work, which discourage long-term employment. A lack of workforce stability disrupts service continuity and quality, putting client retention and satisfaction at risk. According to the Building Service Contractors Association International, 40 percent of contractors in 2025 expected recruitment challenges to escalate in the coming year. This persistent deficit in the workforce erodes profit margins and stifles the overall growth of the market, preventing firms from fully capitalizing on industry momentum. Market Trends The shift toward Data-Driven and Demand-Based Cleaning Models is transforming operational workflows by replacing static schedules with dynamic, usage-based interventions. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and occupancy analytics, facility managers can dispatch cleaning teams precisely where and when they are needed, optimizing resources and preventing hygiene lapses in high-traffic areas. This approach significantly improves service precision and occupant satisfaction; for example, Tork reported in July 2025 that facility managers using the Tork Vision Cleaning system experienced a 75 percent reduction in complaints and a 68 percent improvement in operational efficiency. Concurrently, the market is being reshaped by the Expansion of Green Cleaning and Circular Economy Practices, as clients demand sustainability strategies that exceed simple chemical substitution. Service providers are increasingly adopting circular economy principles, including comprehensive waste diversion and resource-efficient operations, to align with corporate net-zero goals. Demonstrating the impact of these practices, Sodexo UK & Ireland announced in March 2025 that sites utilizing its WasteWatch data program achieved an average 45 percent reduction in food waste, highlighting the operational benefits of targeted sustainability strategies.

Title: What "The Best" Looks Like

Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see. —Arthur Schopenhauer The second that the next round of funding hits the bank, every new CTO starts obsessing over the same thing: Who the hell do I hire next? The answer is surprisingly non-obvious. You’re told that you always want—scratch that, need—the best of the best, your startup’s future depends on it. You’re told your company is unique, special, and it requires the most hardcore among researchers, designers, engineers, and product managers. You never skimp on who builds the golden goose. You can’t succeed with any less than that. But, is that actually true? Every startup-hustle YouTube video, VC podcast and celeb founder interview regurgitates that the key to success is to hire the very best people, no matter what it takes. And yet you live in the real world, with real-world constraints. You have only so much money in the bank. Only so much time and bandwidth to hire. Only so much attention in a given day. And you’re not alone in your hunt. You’re competing with hundreds of other players in your geography, industry, and problem space looking for “the best.” Many of them have a more famous brand, more cash, more promising equity, more charming founders, and maybe even a high production value promo video showcasing happy employees, rare wood office counters and a shoes-off policy. Will you actually hire the best of the best against those odds? Many years ago I found myself in this pickle and I had to learn all the relevant lessons the hard way. I share these lessons here, so that you don’t have to struggle through that same maze yourself. My pain is your gain. My first time around the startup world in 2012, I hardly knew what I was doing and relied mostly on luck—and unfortunately, firing—to end up with a team I could be proud of. I had no real point of reference for greatness, for what “the best” in our area could look like, and building that model required lots of experimentation, with high highs and many low lows. The story of David, our brilliant infrastructure ops engineer at Freckle, has stayed with me ever since. David applied to the company back when we were only hiring for an ops role. We were growing slowly, so there was zero room for anybody who wasn’t absolutely essential on the team. We had no open-ended extra seat for a smart person who just happened to be on the market, unlike some companies these days. David was 100% what we were not looking for. He had never done any ops. In fact, he had never done anything related to web dev or product engineering. I’m not sure he even knew what AWS was at that point. He was a sharp physics guy working with a professor on simulations in an academic context. He didn’t let that deter him. He wanted to work at Freckle, thanks to our reputation as one of the few software startups in the world using Haskell in production at scale. We were an odd outlier in a sea of buggy and laborious Rails apps, a shelter for people who didn’t want yet another web slop gig. And Haskell was oh-so-hot in the Hacker News programming language theory space at the time, a technology attracting software nerds obsessed with correctness and new, better ways of developing bug-free apps. I immediately told David that he was not a fit; he had none of what we were looking for. And yet he persisted, emailing me that he would do whatever test project we threw at him, and if he bombed it, no problem, he would go away. But if he nailed it, we would have proof that he was qualified, in spite of what his CV indicated. Fine. I sent him a meaty cloud ops take-home project, expecting to never hear from him again. Importantly, this was in the days before you could have Claude Code slap that together for you in two prompts. A day or two later, he returned the project to us, and it was pretty much flawless, doing even more than we had asked for. That was not expected. I got curious about what else he could do. We weren’t drowning in applicants anyway, so I figured I didn’t have much to lose. We took him through the usual interview process. He was humble, optimistic, well-spoken, actively communicating and taking feedback well, eager to get to work. He was pumped about everything he could learn on the job, about the doors that would eventually open if he nailed it. He didn’t have much experience, as someone who had never written commercial software before, but he was really quick to absorb everything we threw at him. We gave him a chance. As predicted, he was stellar, and we had a really good run with him until he moved on to a much more illustrious employer. A few years later he became a senior principal engineer at Stripe, going from a physics lab, then a starry-eyed K-12 software startup, to being a big deal at one of Silicon Valley’s finest firms. An unsurprising path for one of “the best.” While building the different companies I worked at, I’ve run several times into “Davids” who ended up with meteoric career trajectories, sometimes already pedigreed in all the right ways, sometimes completely invisible to everyone but the trained eye of a CTO looking for gold. What is special about someone like that? And how can you, with your humble hiring budget, identify them before their value is obvious to everybody else in the market? With David, it was obvious that I had lucked my way into finding him. He had to badger me into seeing what he was capable of, at a time when I was only looking for obvious signs of success. Later on at my game studio, thanks to a brutally skewed job market, I had the total pick of the litter during Hiring Summer and could select one or two stellar engineers from hundreds of perfectly reasonable applicants. There was hardly any competition, with money drying up all around the industry. Again, I found a diamond in the rough. But this time I had the right knowledge and strategies in place to end up with the kind of team I wanted with far less reliance on luck. Even as I was drowning in hundreds of resumes that all started to look the same, “the best” candidate was still in there, like a needle in a haystack. This time, I felt like I was actually skilled enough to find that hidden gem, not simply crossing my fingers and relying on luck alone. That’s a feeling of empowerment I would like you to experience as well. Of course, when every company says they have the best people, the math doesn’t work out. And of course, if they regularly have to fire staff, something doesn’t add up again. One day you end up landing a job at one of these companies and realize that the braggadocio was hardly reflective of reality, but then again, it’s all part of the startup founder LARP that requires you play the part. “Our team is okay, you will probably like working here, we sometimes know what we’re doing” would be a much more accurate depiction, but you’ll never find that quote on the careers page. Regardless, you want to be a good Boy Scout CTO and live up to the lofty expectations set for you by the Silicon Valley elders, and at least try to hire “the best of the best” as they say in all of the fireside chats. But then, a question naturally emerges: what exactly do we mean by the best? The accolades? Pedigrees? Github stars? Hacker News front pages? Job title? Celebrity employers? Number of former YCombinator companies worked at? Hackathon wins? Typing speed? Clout among other Rust developers wearing fuzzy animal costumes? That all sounds good, I guess, but is that all relevant to your company? It turns out that “the best” is mostly subjective and specific to your situation. The culture, the vibe, the industry, the processes of your company, and the technical choices will all influence who will be a phenomenal addition to your tribe. That person might not be the same individual bringing in a million or two a year at Meta. In fact, that highly pedigreed, highly connected individual might be a net negative for your company, even though they might, at least on paper, seem the most high-end among candidates. They may blow the mind of a recruiter at Netflix, but they may not want to schlep through all of the messiness and chaos of an early stage company still trying to define itself. They’re not the best for you, and they’re likely not the best for startups, but plenty of other people are. Your job is to determine what those traits are and where to find people who have them. Your company, timing, industry, problem space and founding team personalities are unique, which is why a generic blog post or a book could never tell you exactly what hires are optimal for you. However, experience shows that there are many universal winning commonalities between great hires that will be applicable regardless of your early stage company’s unique DNA. I identify 11 of them below. The 11 traits: As a side note, I found Patrick Lencioni’s framework from The Ideal Team Player to survive first contact with both pre-seed and Series A+ realities. It’s one of those dry-as-dust HBR book club management self-help guides that get an eyeroll by your median 20-year-old founder going through YCombinator, but in my experience it confirmed and put a simple model around something I had personally seen emerge again and again in the field. Lencioni identifies three essential traits: hunger, humility and smarts, the latter of which should have been called EQ all along. You’ll see them referenced below. The three criteria may seem obvious at a glance, but having a simple framework to work with as you’re making hundreds of decisions makes a big difference. Simple things done right turn out to be pretty darn powerful. Let’s take a closer look at the 11 commonalities among great startup hires I’ve identified. Some of them are simply statistically likely to occur due to the nature of startup hiring. Others are ones you should straight up filter for when you’re doing your search. The best hires in the early stages are usually non-obviously good to the untrained eye. They don’t look as appealing to employers with infinite resources who otherwise would have already hired them. If they were obviously incredible, it would be unlikely you—at your startup—would ever talk to them. One of the most important skills of a startup CTO trying to hire an amazing team is the ability to uncover awesome talent that others have overlooked. These candidates get skipped often due to being too off-the-beaten-path and under-pedigreed compared to the obvious picks that every other company is making. Often these candidates are bad at marketing themselves, don’t know where to look, and are off-putting in some way to the naive search. You have an opportunity to take advantage of that oversight. Realistically, someone who looks like the perfect FAANG candidate who has won all of the math olympiads, had all of the stellar internships, and went to the top CS schools will either: a. get a big cash dump from YC and start their own thing, or b. go work at one of the career-building brand names in the Valley and make a monstrous amount of money. The karmic wheel is just about cycling between those two until that person either gets into VC or becomes an exec at a prestigious firm years later. If that’s what the universe has in store for a candidate, taking a chance on a no-name team with 12 months in the bank, poor development practices and sloppy management is a tough proposition. That leaves a pretty large pool of “everybody else” who didn’t pattern-match. How you go about sifting through them is a big topic I will leave for another chapter, but the key is to look for signals that are less obvious than a Stanford degree and an OpenAI internship. Often that looks like a large volume of work, expertise in unsexy niche areas of technology, an intense work ethic driven by curiosity, and many others. A Stanford CS degree is no guarantee someone will be a phenomenal contributor at your company, but it’s a reasonable proxy of future potential for large employers with long time horizons that allow them to invest in coaching and nurturing their junior staff. That’s not in the cards for a pre-revenue startup that will run out of money next year. The best people for your startup will most likely be senior, or at least mid-stage contributors with several solid years of experience. Too senior isn’t great either, you don’t need the large scale cross-team mature product jousting chops. There’s likely no staff-level work for them to do, and staff-level engineers aren’t just faster-typing seniors. As an early stage startup, until you have enough lead developers, senior product managers, senior designers etc. to set the standard, hiring fresh-out-of-school contributors is a gamble. Junior staff are still developing their taste, judgment, ability to work in a team, and understanding of how to follow the process and when to deviate from it. Without an adult in the room you’re in cat-herding territory. This isn’t to say that you won’t get work done this way, but you could have had someone else in that seat who required less supervision. And you’re at a stage where every seat is mission-critical and the opportunity cost is significant. While it might not matter too much as you throw prototype spaghetti at the wall in the early days, as soon as you have something worth maintaining and complexity rises, you’re now in a race against time. Someone must actively garden the complexity of the work and be ultimately responsible for it, and that someone will tend to be not fresh-out-of-school. Sure, a green dev can care about complexity. But most haven’t yet lived through a soul-crushing, multi-week refactor fueled by years of tech debt, the kind of preventable trauma that earns you “character-building scars.” If they’re learning those lessons on your watch, they’re doing it at the expense of your delivery timeline and your sanity. I’m fond of mid-stage software developers who demonstrate terrific chops, hunger to learn and prove themselves. Yes, they require more hand-holding, but usually the volume of work they put out, and their openness to re-do it, if needed, is worth betting on. You should be able to manage a couple of them yourself as the CTO in the early days, and soon enough you’ll have other senior people on the team who will pick up the mentorship torch. This also means that the “best people” to hire at this stage will tend to be earlier in their careers. The longer great people are on the market, the more likely they are to be identified by the market as being great. Your job as a startup CTO is to find them before others do. Once the market has found them and has actively started rewarding them, they will be out of your price range. Now, it’s worth mentioning that in specific well-capitalized niches of the startup market, companies are now able to pay a decent chunk of change thanks to larger VC rounds and quicker time-to-revenue. Thus, the old school notion that BigCo always pays best may not hold true as often. Here’s a quick sample of many Work at a Startup roles in December 2025. Not quite at FAANG-level, but far from starvation. That also means that, unless your company grows fast or shows tremendous potential for the yet-unvested equity, you won’t get a ton of time with your great early career hires. They will quickly accumulate valuable experience and prove themselves to be stellar, and move on to a prestigious employer with longer time horizons, a great brand name, and a stupendous paycheck that you will not be able to match. Being an L5-7 at BigCo pays a pretty penny, with none of the unpredictability of startup equity and saner hours, but none of the adventure and camaraderie of a pirate ship. For employees later in their careers, that’s not a bad tradeoff. Once they have vested with your company, it makes sense for them to diversify their equities, as they already own one lottery ticket. Being on the receiving end of a reference call for one of your star employees, while they’re still working at your company, is always bittersweet: on one hand you want what’s best for them, to level up and grow in their career. On the other, they’re your discovery—dang it—and you know you won’t be able to counter-offer the type of employer they can now attract. Or they decide to start their own company, emboldened and informed by the experience at yours. In the end, that’s okay. Sometimes a great hire’s growth trajectory is faster than a startup’s, and you can be grateful for having given them a chance to prove themselves and to find a new path that they wouldn’t have otherwise. That kind of hire will have likely made a major difference to your company and having trusted alumni out there in the world doing great things should be a source of pride and good industry karma for any CTO who discovered them. The best hires are self-driven, stoked by the ability to learn, to gain mastery of the craft, and by being able to show off their accomplishments to the rest of the team they want to impress. When you look at their track record, even when it’s not filled with household-name accolades and pedigrees, you will typically see breadcrumbs of exploration, toy projects and experimentation fueled by curiosity. It’s that classic desire to hack things and understand them. You don’t need to ask them to work a little harder, they know this is a big growth spurt for them and they want to take advantage of it. The company is giving them a valuable practice canvas for their skills and they want to make the most of this opportunity, which unfortunately isn’t that common. They love a challenge, they want to prove themselves, they love the work and they are excited by being around others who will push them to be their best. They would have been hacking on something interesting either way, but now you’re actually paying them to do it. They’re curious about how everything works: your company, the startup world, the industry they’re diving into, other disciplines, the tech they’re using. They’re learning, absorbing. Maybe they want to start their own thing one day, or maybe they’re set on using this gig as a ramp to something else they dream about. Maybe they just want the new optionality granted by having your company on their resume. They’re sponges and will gladly take on the challenges you send their way. I remember throwing a big Redux experiment at David in what must have been his first month at work. Again, no web dev experience prior to this. Nobody on the team knew the technology and he, hired as an infrastructure engineer with a background in physics and zero product engineering experience, had something up and running for us within days. He was pumped he got to do something so radically new for the team as one of his first assignments. Ultimately we decided the tech wasn’t a fit for our existing codebase, we scrapped the experiment, and he ran off to the next challenge with no loss of enthusiasm. At Double Dusk we could not figure out why players would regularly de-sync their character positions on the server when using a custom—and wildly complicated, due to needing to replicate Half Life 2-style movement to the smallest detail inside of Unreal Engine—character movement component in combination with our own Unreal Engine networking tweaks, making character movement authoritative on client instances of the game. A big deviation from the defaults. Our newly-hired star engineer, us being his first ever employer, had to dive into the pit of madness. He almost gave up several times before finally identifying all of the spots in the physics sub-stepping logic that was causing the drift across the network. I’m confident I myself would have gone completely bananas trying to debug that one. He was proud of the trust we had put in him, he was eager to learn, he didn’t want to let the team down, and I knew enough about him to make the bet that the challenge would have been just barely within his abilities. Hunger is a massive force-multiplier, and unlike many other traits, it doesn’t seem to be teachable. Failures will instill humility. Rejection will hone your EQ. But you’re either driven to compete, learn and prove yourself, or you’re not. No manager’s pep talk will kickstart that drive in you, at least not sustainably. The hubris has to come from somewhere much deeper. Startups are all about rapid experimentation, trying countless ideas that don’t work, and bootstrapping the skills and processes of the company as it figures out just what exactly people will pay for. Trust-building is critical in any team endeavor, and members who are unable to admit fault, who take up all of the space, and/or who need to be right at all costs will be a real problem as the company matures. The best hires are humble and will happily talk about both their victories and their biggest implosions, about what they learned from their misadventures, about talented past coworkers and how their efforts were part of a team. They rarely claim to have single-handedly carried everything on their backs. As you interview candidates searching for the best, many non-obvious great hires will be bad at behavioral interviews—or interviews in general, for that matter. They didn’t get extensive training on answering questions using the STAR method, didn’t drill stock responses to predictable and tired interview questions. They’re early-ish stage hands-on technology people, not smooth-talking execs jumping from one boardroom to the next. It is your job to fish for key nuggets of insight buried in the rough presentation. After you interview enough people with a similar set of standard questions, you’ll be able to spot the outliers in the bell curve of responses. An underrated aspect of humility in startups is detachment from one’s work. Companies in the process of inventing themselves need to actively cycle through many ideas, most of which will ultimately not stand the test of time. Design for the trash can and kill your darlings are important mindsets in creative work, and they extend far beyond music, film and games. Quantity leads to quality, and a great hire will accept regularly needing to apply a flamethrower to their work and try again with the new learnings from the latest experiment. They will not be precious about it, nor will they feel diminished by needing to try again. The Davids do not keep score; they keep trying and do the work knowing that there’s a good chance it will not go anywhere. That is also highly correlated with their ability to take feedback without taking it personally. They’re not afraid of criticism and quick feedback loops. In fact, they seek disconfirmation sooner rather than later. They have excellent feedback metabolism. Building technology companies is a team sport. Everything you do is with the help of other people, for the benefit of other people. As much as the startup world fetishizes the cracked ninja jedi 10x code-poet, if that person makes others never want to talk to them again, cracked they are not. Someone who is able to work with others’ quirks, understand how they operate and what they respond to, and act in a way that brings the best out of their teammates is worth their weight in gold. Brilliant jerks, as great as they are for producing riveting drama in TV shows, quickly become a net negative in the real world. We’re in the squishy human feeling territory here (aka “soft skills”) and you can’t LeetCode your way into knowing if someone will be an ass. There’s no FizzBuzz for empathy. You have to ask them standard questions, shoot the breeze, interact during the various testing phases of the interview, and outside, and ultimately make a call based on the limited data you have. You will never have all of the evidence, but ultimately you have to make a go or no-go call. Sometimes you get lucky and the candidate discloses a consistent pattern from their past that is obviously disqualifying, but often you don’t. How they interact with you and your team throughout the interview is usually a good data point, and that, of course, goes both ways. Regardless of how you investigate this side of them, it’s non-negotiable, and the best hires you’ll make will all have a high EQ. At the same time, someone highly empathetic, but who hides in a cave and is unable to coordinate their work with the rest of the software orchestra, is not the best. Great team players anticipate others’ questions and concerns, and are proactive about reaching out and communicating both their status and the progress of their work to those around them. They make their work visible instead of requiring constant polling for the team to figure out what exactly is going on with them. Remote environments in particular benefit from strong proactive communicators, as you can’t get away with always knowing what’s going on with everybody due to sitting in the same room for most of the week. One great Loom is worth a thousand words, but a thousand words is still much better than having to pull status out of people. Early stage startups move at a pace that generates tremendous entropy, and someone who’s able to coordinate with the rest of a team in a way that feels natural and effortless will allow the small teams to scale without requiring project management and complex processes meant for lower-performing contributors. Perhaps counterintuitively, I don’t fret too much about competence. To me, that’s a given. If your interview funnel is set up well, with a great take-home project, an onsite, or even a work trial, determining if the person you’re interviewing is competent should emerge naturally. After all, you and your team are technical experts, craftspeople who can look at another craftsperson’s work and quickly judge if it is any good. Yes, AI is getting pretty good these days and it’s becoming easy for candidates of all disciplines to hide behind prompts, but that’s only an extra reason to allow them to bring those tools into the interview itself and showcase their use rather than shamefully hide their existence. How they use the agents, the back-and-forth, the planning, the tweaking, the types of searches they do as part of the exercise are all valuable data points for determining competence, and you should allow candidates to surface them. In-person interviews and work trials are for now non-gameable, so if you’re extra paranoid, they are a great option. Non-obvious candidates will be in the hiring race with fewer other companies, possibly none, depending on your industry. That gives both you and them more flexibility and time to try working together for a few days before making it official. With a sufficiently relevant set of tasks for the work trial, you can rest assured that they’re competent, and learn a lot more about their other traits in the process. The best start-up hires are problem-solvers, not ticket resolvers. They want to understand what the business is trying to accomplish, what challenge is standing in the way of it, and how to make that problem go away. They’re autonomous in the best of ways. They don’t sit around waiting for someone to tell them what to do; they proactively find challenges and opportunities for improvement, iterate on the feedback, and go out of their way to help their teammates. They figure things out, and they do it without needing their hands held. Someone like David didn’t take no for an answer; he assumed there had to be a narrow path through the rejections he kept getting from me, that it was only a matter of his resourcefulness before he found a crack through which to get what he wanted. The communication, coordination and cohesion overheads that emerge with the addition of more and more staff to the roster are probably the toughest parts of scaling any business. A leader’s job is to streamline and remove these emergent dependencies between people and teams as much as possible. Besides keeping the number of hires low, the other powerful lever that a start-up CTO has is to hire people who will be self-sufficient and require little to no support to get their jobs done. They will ask for help when necessary, but they will take pride in figuring things out on their own, checking in with you when the time is right. They will require little supervision overall, and only direction when it comes to their work. If they’re falling behind, being great communicators, they will let the rest of the team know. If they’re early, they’ll gladly pick the next interesting opportunity to be useful. If they’re struggling, their pride in their work will make them double-down and overcome the challenge at all costs. In that case your job is to help them pump the brakes when necessary, or their pace can become unsustainable. A great startup hire doesn’t only think about their respective lane, but cares about the other disciplines around them that their work is impacting. They understand their angle, their priorities, and their expectations. For example: They think about where and how their work will land and anticipate those objections, addressing them in advance. They proactively reach out to those disciplines to avoid yet another coordination chokepoint that will only gobble up time. As more and more skills are compacting into one single individual, we see AI engineers, product engineers, and product managers becoming more technical and moving downstream into programming. This sort of cross-disciplinary mindset buys companies a ton of leverage and ability to iterate faster. Of course, this becomes progressively easier with experience and seniority. But that’s also why startups moving fast benefit from more mature contributors as time goes on. The reduced communication costs multiplied across more and more team members really add up over time. Unless you have very specific technical needs, having a generalist bias in the early days is a great idea. In fact we’re seeing more and more disciplines get compressed into one, with software developers covering UI, UX, PM and engineering, effectively becoming a cross-disciplinary team of one. Even in later stages, half-a-pizza teams powered by AI can move mountains on timelines that felt impossible just a few years ago. Early-stage startups are notoriously chaotic and unpredictable. You might be working on one feature one day, it might get cancelled the next day, and maybe now you’re fielding customer support calls for something you shipped that accidentally blew up. The next day you’re taking a trip to a customer site to chat with potential users. At no point do you know if any of this will make you money, how long until you kill that feature, and how many more of these iterations you’ll do before you either strike gold or the company runs out of money. There are no guarantees in the startup world, except for the fact that your runway will eventually reach zero if you don’t find something worth selling. As a CTO, it is your responsibility to shield your team from the messy everyday financial reality of where your company is headed. At the same time, I prefer to keep as much as possible in the open so that the team knows how much longer the music will play and when it’s time to start refreshing their LinkedIn profiles. I never want anything to be a surprise to the team when I could have been candid about it far in advance. It’s a fine balance between hiding the daily volatility—mostly of the founders’ moods and their confidence in the company making it—and exposing the long-term trends. This type of universe requires people who are okay with fewer guarantees. A startup will never have the time to run comprehensive studies, to build extensive plans, to gain all of the information necessary to make the right decision. Seeking perfection at the cost of an action is generally unacceptable, and you learn much more by failing in a valiant attempt than in delaying a perfect attempt that you might have validated months earlier by just doing the thing. Great hires respect that process and are willing to operate without all of the information, accepting that the team will figure it out as it moves forward, often deviating from the original objective. Deleting existing artifacts or completely pivoting to a new strategy on a dime is the ultimate startup superpower. Anybody who needs well-spelled-out plans and continuity in whatever they’re doing will ultimately struggle in that kind of environment. Hiring is a gamble, but you can tilt the odds in your favor if you stop playing the same game as everyone else. The “best” hire isn’t the person with the most GitHub stars or the flashiest resume; it’s the person who makes your team better by existing within it. It’s the David who breaks down doors and ends up shaping the direction of the company through their relentless contributions. Developing an eye for non-obvious talent is the only way to build a high-leverage team on a startup budget. Yes, it takes more work. It requires you to actually pay attention. It’s one of the hardest feats to pull off in startup team building. It means you must trust your own judgment over a candidate’s credentials. But if you do it right, you don’t just get a “nice” team, you get a team capable of doing the impossible. Now stop reading and go find “the best”. 28 Dec, 2025 | #cto #startups #leadership #management #hiring #recruiting #talent-acquisition #company-building Share: X HN LinkedIn Reddit Subscribe to the newsletter Hard-won lessons on software, startups, and leading teams.

The company that is shepherding the broadcast television industry toward ATSC 3.0 digital broadcasting services, which owns a group of over-the-air stations that very much seeks to merge with The E.W. Scripps Co. despite that company’s insistence the unwanted overtures end, has announced when it will report its Q4 2025 earnings results. Sinclair Inc. C-Suite executives including Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley will be discussing the company’s fourth quarter fiscal health report in an conference call scheduled for 4:30pm Eastern on February 25. Analysts, shareholders and other interested parties will have no more than 30 minutes prior to the call to glance over the results, as Sinclair intends to release them following the Closing Bell on the Nasdaq markets for that day’s trading session. The results reflecting the final three months of 2025 come at a period of relative stability for “SBGI,” the company’s Nasdaq GlobalSelect market-traded stock. Sinclair shares finished January 23’s trading session at $15.05, and that’s all but flat from one year ago. While that’s better than a steep year-over-year decline, the lack of meaningful growth could be concerning for long-term shareholders, as “SBGI” is off from a five-year high of $38.41 attributed to an early March 2021 surge in valuation. Over the next 12 months, “SBGI’ remained between $28 and $38, in March 2022 began a two-year dip. The good news? Sinclair’s stock has avoided dipping to below $10, a price nearly reached in October 2023. What are analysts forecasting for Sinclair in Q4 2025? Just one analyst reporting to Yahoo! Finance chimed in with earnings per share estimates, putting Sinclair at -$0.06 on very difficult comps tied to strong political revenue at the end of 2024. Five analysts offered revenue predictions, putting the consensus estimate at $840.25 million, down by 16.3% from the final three months of 2024. Sinclair’s lead institutional investors are Mario Gabelli-led GAMCO Investors Inc., with 9.24% attributable equity interest. That’s followed by The Vanguard Group, as of the end of Q3 2025, with some 8.09% interest in Sinclair. The third-largest institutional investor as of September 30, 2025, is Blackrock Inc., with 6.49% interest. Your email address will not be published.

Shares of Coreweave (CRWV) rose 9% during pre-market trading on Monday after AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) invested another $2 billion in an effort to accelerate the company's buildout of next-generation data centers built specifically for AI workloads. The funding, which came through the purchase of CoreWeave’s Class A stock at $87.20 per share, will help the company scale up to more than 5 gigawatts of AI-dedicated data centers, or “AI factories,” by the end of the decade. CRWV closed at $92.98 on Friday. With the early gain, the stock is trading just above $101. NVDA shares are lower by 0.5% pre-market. Nvidia's backing provides more than capital. The deal also extends a years-long collaboration that aligns both firms on hardware, software and data center strategy. The companies will also test CoreWeave’s software stack, including its resource scheduling platform Mission Control, with an eye toward integrating it into Nvidia's broader ecosystem. “CoreWeave’s deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry," Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia said in a statement. Nvidia last September entered into a $6.3 billion agreement with CoreWeave to purchase unsold computing capacity through 2032. CoreWeave started as a bitcoin mining company in 2017 under the name Atlantic Crypto, but quickly pivoted to cloud computing and AI after the crypto crash in 2018.

Title: Greenland, Donald Trump, Technocracy and the Globalist New World Order

Will this Arctic island, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, continue to run its own affairs domestically and remain constitutionally linked to its parent country—or will it be appropriated by the American Empire? To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. As an increasing number of strapped families throughout the world struggle to put food on the table and pay for ever-rising living expenses, the internet crowd seems more concerned with US President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing Greenland than with what’s happening to average peoples’ ability to survive. Greenland? Where’s Greenland? For those whose knowledge of geography is slim: Greenland is an island located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans—northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland. At 822,700 square miles, Greenland is by far the earth’s largest island. By contrast, the second-largest, New Guinea, is only 303,381 square miles. . . These days, in light of Trump’s tantalizing statements, both the mainstream media and the alternative media are posing some interesting, though irrelevant, questions about Greenland, such as: Why do I call these questions irrelevant? As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. Besides being part of NATO, Greenland has played a crucial role in securing the northern flank of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). This role was established when Denmark and the United States signed the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement, a bilateral treaty that made Greenland host to some of America’s most important and sophisticated surveillance technologies and military bases. Take, for example, Pituffik Space Base, formerly named Thule Air Base. It is a US Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland. Although the number of service members stationed at Pituffik has been greatly reduced since the end of the Cold War, there are approximately 150 troops still stationed permanently at the base. When needed, this number can be greatly increased on short notice by simply flying in thousands of US military personnel and equipment on C-17 Globemaster and C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Pituffik has a 9,995-foot runway that can easily accommodate all US fighter jets and transport aircraft. . 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89s, Thule Air Base, Greenland, 1955 (United States Air Force / Public Domain) . Moreover, Pituffik is home to the 12th Space Warning Squadron, which operates phased array radar sites at known and secret locations throughout Greenland. This computer-controlled type of radar can detect and track Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and satellites. The same base also hosts Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, which is part of Space Delta’s global satellite control network. Space Delta, the primary operational unit within the US Space Force, manages specific critical global satellite missions, from military communications to missile tracking. In addition, the US military maintains numerous Over-the-Horizon radar systems at radar sites such as Pituffik and other, classified locations in Greenland. OTH radar can listen to, monitor, and track military activity thousands of kilometres away, including in Russia, on the east side of the North Pole—Greenland is on the North Pole’s west side—and beyond. Therefore, if the US government were to acquire Greenland, either through military action or diplomacy, little would change. Annexing Greenland would be a mere formality, acknowledging something that has already been a reality for more than seventy years. Greenland has always been integral to the American Empire’s global control grid.Washington insiders have long understood that Greenland’s geographic location is strategically indispensable if the US is to keep a close eye on the Arctic Northwest Passage—the sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean—as well as a close eye on that region’s vast mineral, oil, and natural gas deposits. Thus, claiming that an invasion of Greenland by the US would mark the end of NATO is a moot point on at least two counts: If Greenland is already solidly in America’s sphere of influence, why is Trump talking about adding this island to “his” Empire’s acquisitions? Aside from rich and largely untapped natural resources—huge, unproven, and unexploited oil deposits (potentially 7.3 billion barrels), natural gas reserves (estimated to be anywhere from 50 trillion to 150 trillion cubic feet), and extensive mineral deposits—there is, I believe, one other main reason for this sudden attention being paid to Greenland. My hunch is that Trump is being leaned on to annex Greenland by certain highly influential individuals who contributed handsomely to his second presidential election campaign. These men—namely, Elon Musk ($292 million), Howard Lutnick ($9 million), Peter Thiel ($1.25 million), and Sam Altman ($1 million)—are now in a position to steer the President in whatever direction they desire for the purpose of fulfilling their primary goal. They are chomping at the bit to form what is known as the North American Technate, the linchpin to a full-blown and ultimately worldwide Technocracy. Musk, Lutnick, Thiel, Altman, and a number of their equally obsessive technocratic colleagues have ensconced themselves in positions of power in Trump’s current administration. They are the modern-day technocrats carrying out the dream of Howard Scott, an engineer who, with Thorstein Veblen, co-founded in 1919 the Technical Alliance, based in New York City. For those readers new to the term “Technocracy” and its history, a brief explanation is in order. The Technical Alliance was reorganized in 1932 and was moved to Columbia University, also in New York, under the name “Committee on Technocracy.” In 1933, Scott joined forces with economist M. King Hubbert—whom he had met two years earlier—to found Technocracy, Inc. Scott was the Technocracy movement’s driving force—its engineer, ideologue, innovator, intellectual—while Hubbert, a geologist, played a major supporting role as the organization’s secretary, researcher, and writer. In 1937, these two technocrats and some other lesser-known figures came up with a concise definition that explains the technocratic philosophy: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical engineering problem. Though Technocracy, Inc. disappeared (went underground?) for half-a-century, it has resurfaced in recent years. Today’s Technocracy movement is run by an equally radical group of scientists and engineers who, thanks to advancements in technology, finally have the ability to catalogue, surveil, track, trace, monitor, subjugate, and manipulate—or, to put it in one word, control—an entire population and thereby achieve specific scientific, social, geopolitical, and economic ends. Representative government, national sovereignty, the nation-state structure, politicians, capitalism, and even currencies are regarded as nonessential in a technocratic dictatorship. The 1930s vision of Technocracy’s behavioural control system is fast becoming a reality. What we are witnessing with regard to the recent events in Venezuela and the recent discussions about Greenland is a step or two closer to the completion of the North American Technate as it was envisioned and presented in 1940 by Technocracy, Inc. . The 1940 Map of the “Technate of America” . The 1940 “Technate of America” map (see above) represents one of the primary pillars that support the canopy of the multi-pillar globalist New World Order. I picture five pillars holding up a square canopy. In the center I envision the strongest and highest pillar. From its peak and to its peak—in both directions—flow all closely coordinated events, activities, and processes that the world’s powerful institutions and individuals plan together and carry out simultaneously. This pillar is in the middle (the center) because it is unique and of primary (central) importance to the whole structure. In the four corners I visualize four pillars of equal proportions. If the center pillar has primacy—which it does, and if it is preeminent—which it is, then these four pillars are of secondary stature and scope. Each of these smaller pillars props up its respective corner of the square canopy. What do all five pillars reflected in my mind’s eye represent in the real world? The central, or center, pillar, represents the 1940 Technate map. It is the highest and the strongest pillar because it is where the largest and militarily strongest empire in history, the American Empire, resides. It is here where Technocracy had its roots. And it is here where many US-based globalist think tanks—the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation, to name a few—were founded and continue to function. The central pillar is also home to the United Nations(UN) and to the agencies that operate under its umbrella: the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. [Note: Although the WHO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, it nonetheless answers to the UN, which is headquartered on Rockefeller-donated land in New York City. The same holds true for the World Economic Forum (WEF), based in Geneva but connected to the central pillar by way of its adherence to the philosophy and principles of Technocracy.] It is through the UN and its offshoot organizations that the five key objectives of the one-world technocratic convergence are being advanced. These five key objectives are: (1) digital biometric IDs, (2) thought-crime laws, (3) social credit systems, (4) carbon credits, and (5) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). When all five objectives have eventually been met, it is safe to say that the walls of a digital gulag will have been erected around each pillar—not only the central pillar of the American Empire but also the four other pillars, which we shall identify momentarily. But first, we should mention that the strongest component within—the dominant powergoverning—the American Empire is the US Department of War (DOW). Housed in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the DOW encompasses six branches of the armed services. Combined, these branches arguably have the most advanced technology, the heftiest financial resources, the widest global reach, the best logistical capabilities, and the highest degree of operational readiness on the planet. The US military’s role is not so much to defend the country as it is to maintain and protect the interests of the Wall Street money center banks. The Pentagon is also devoted to extending, beyond the US, the biosecurity medical industrial complex. For instance, it can at any point create another Operation Warp Speed with its fraudulent “vaccines.” Second, we should also mention that the State of Israel has long been the leading recipient of US foreign aid, much of it in the form of military assistance. For this reason, we can accurately claim that Israel’s government and its intelligence and military assets are intimately connected with the central pillar, the American Empire.And we can safety predict that Israel will continue to obligingly serve the US by keeping a watchful eye on the rest of the Middle East, including the region’s vast oil and gas reserves. In one of the four corners of the square we have the second pillar: the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of Nations. Atop the UK pillar is Chatham House, which formulates the UK policy agenda. The agenda is then distributed to the UK government’s various arms, which in turn promote the policies to all UK citizens. The United Kingdom is an especially crucial pillar because after it pushes, tests, and implements the five objectives of its technocratic agenda in the UK, it does the same thing in its 56 Commonwealth nations, which span Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania. Although the UK has thus far met only one of the five objectives—thought-crime laws—the government is desperately seeking ways to execute the other four plans so it can meet all five targets. In another corner we have the pillar of the Brussels-based European Parliament. This pillar is the focal point for disseminating the technocratic plan throughout all of Europe. The European Parliament is a directly elected legislative arm of the European Union (EU), based on the Soviet system of government and without the encumbrance of democratic oversight. Thus, it effectively forms the perfect structure to extend the digital gulag’s five objectives to each member country in the EU. Holding up the New World Order canopy in another corner is China and its multi-titled technocratic leader, Xi Jinping. Since 1978, when one of Xi’s predecessors, Deng Xiaoping, became “paramount leader,” Chinese technocrats have been engineering every economic and social initiative, transforming that communist country into the world’s first Technate. Having met all five objectives—that is, having all five elements of Technocracy securely in place—China is now poised to export its technocratic know-how to client states in Africa and in Asia and to some other nations that belong to the informal, intergovernmental BRICS grouping—namely, the nations of Brazil, India, and South Africa. In the fourth and final corner of the five-pillared square we have Vladimir Putin’s Russia. [Note: Russia belongs to BRICS, but it is its own pillar.] On the heels of China, all five of whose control systems are in place, Russia has implemented four of them: digital IDs, thought-crime laws, CBDCs, and carbon credits. Now the Russian Federation is attempting to rapidly deploy the remaining element of its control grid: a social credit system. Observe that all five pillars act in unison to support the all-inclusive canopy of the techno-feudalistic New World Order. If one of the pillars were to separate from the edifice, the entire structure would collapse. Therefore, the notion that we live in a “multi-polar” world order, made up of separate poles, is a fallacy. Rather, it is one world order, with each of its pillars dependent upon the others, and vice versa, with all of its pillars dependent upon each one. Put another way, no nation is an outlier or will last long if it tries to be. The world’s 193 sovereign countries (voting UN members), plus the Vatican City and the State of Palestine (non-UN members, having observer status only), plus possibly Taiwan and Kosovo (some sources list them as sovereign nations; others do not) coalesce under one pillar or another. Each and all of the five pillars are needed to support the canopy of the one-world technocratic state. The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not a nation is recognized by the others, every jurisdiction on the planet is, to one degree or another, at one pace or another, building digital prison walls. However, it’s not quite enough to have pillars covered by a canopy. The entire structure must be anchored to a single, solid foundation. That foundation is a global monetary and financial system. Importantly, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) plays a central role in that underlying system. Without the support of the BIS and its sixty-three member central banks and monetary authorities—plus the extraordinary influence of enormous investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—nothing I have described above would be possible. In other words, without the worldwide network of central banks, the entire assembly of New World Order pillars would collapse in a matter of days—and with it, all of its presumed power and its assumed authority. Isn’t it high time we resist the technocrats and abandon their dictatorial “science” of social engineering? After all, we have no need for self-inflated rulers, be they corporate or governmental, to tell us how we should—or shouldn’t—lead our lives. We do have a need to assert our sovereign rights, be they individual or national. (Denmark and Greenland, are you listening?) We do have a need to intelligently focus on finding fair-minded, peace-producing solutions to our problems. And we do have an innate, mutual desire to provide brotherly aid to and receive aid from our neighbours, be they next door or on another continent. When we are truly considerate of our neighbours, near and far, we do not infringe on their autonomy, as the tyrannical Trump is trying to do with Greenland and every other territory he covets. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

These real problems are being ignored by the fake “climate change” crowd, who hide their mercenary motives behind euphemisms like “sustainable development goals” (SDGs) and “environmental, social, and governance” benchmarks (ESGs) and florid phrases such as the “Great Reset” and “Build Back Better.” Featured image source Global Research is a reader-funded media.

Investing Stocks open Monday, hoping to end a two-week losing streak as fourth-quarter earnings reports return and take center stage. With volatility cooling somewhat, investors can get back to focusing on economic fundamentals and earnings reports. One nagging concern that reemerged last week was private credit funding, which many on Wall Street, including JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, are worried about. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading flat as we get ready to start the new trading week, and despite a strong rebound last Wednesday through Friday, we still ended with our second straight losing week. As the smoke cleared from the Greenland turmoil and no new tariffs were imposed on Europe, investors renewed scrutiny of fourth-quarter earnings, which so far have been solid. With 1/5 of the S&P 500 set to report and hundreds of other stocks also releasing data, plus more economic reports set to hit the tape this week, there could be another batch of volatility-driven swings coming our way to move stocks. The Dow Jones Industrials fell by 0.58% to close at 49,098, while the S&P 500 ended the Friday session flat at 6,915, down just 0.03%. The big loser on Friday was the Russell 2000, which has been the leading index so far this year. It closed down 1.82% at 2,669. Yields were down across almost the entire yield curve, extending a three-day recovery, as the market stabilized following a volatile week driven by trade tensions, potential tariff threats from President Trump regarding Greenland, and global issues, particularly the Japanese bond market turbulence, which saw yields rise on some maturities by almost 30 basis points. The 30-year long bond finished Friday at 4.83%, while the benchmark ten-year note was last seen at 4.23%. Prices across the energy complex rose by almost 3% on Friday, driven primarily by intensified geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as the U.S. has dispatched an “armada” of warships toward Iran, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. In addition, new U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil vessels and reports of production issues in Kazakhstan further added to the upward pressure for the black gold. Brent Crude closed Friday at $65.88, up 2.84%, while West Texas Intermediate ended trading at $61.07, up 2.88%. Natural gas extended its parabolic move, tacking on another 4.56% to close at $5.28. Over the course of last week, it rose by more than 70% as frigid weather sparked demand and heightened concerns about potential production freeze-offs. After another stellar week for precious metals, it continued on Friday, with Gold finishing the day up 0.96% at $4,983. During the week, the analysts at Goldman Sachs lifted their year-end target for Gold to $5,400 from $5,000. Silver was last seen Friday at $103.08, up a whopping 7.31%. Crypto markets saw some severe downward pressure on Friday with major cryptocurrencies dropping as investors shifted toward safe-haven assets like gold amid rising U.S.-NATO tensions, reversing some of the week’s earlier gains. Bitcoin hovered around $89,500 after a 0.4% decline, while Ethereum dropped 2.1% and XRP fell 2.5% in early trading, following a volatile week of “yo-yoing” prices. As of 8 A.M. EST, Bitcoin was trading at $87,710, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,899, down 1.3%. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Investing Amazon (AMZN) social sentiment dropped to negative 0.15 from a 0.12 quarterly average. Amazon plans to cut 14,000-15,000 jobs starting January 28. Amazon capex surged 55% to $35.1B in Q3. Operating income growth was just 0.06% despite 13.4% revenue growth. Amazon’s YTD return of 4.1% lags NVDA’s 27.5% and GOOGL’s 67% despite 95% analyst Buy ratings. Sending You to Google News in 3 © kasinv / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are up 0.5% this week, but retail investor sentiment tells a darker story. The company’s social sentiment score dropped to negative 0.15 on Reddit and X over the past week, a sharp reversal from its neutral-bullish 0.12 average over the prior quarter. Among select tech peers, Amazon stands alone in sustained bearish sentiment while companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoy bullish or neutral enthusiasm from the retail crowd. A viral post on r/wallstreetbets captured the mood, racking up 2,744 upvotes and 406 comments in 24 hours. The post’s title bluntly stated: “Amazon Just announces a new round of Lay-offs. Combined with AI driven lay-offs.” The announcement hit AWS, retail, Prime Video, and HR divisions hardest, with CEO Andy Jassy framing the cuts as cultural changes driven by AI adoption rather than purely financial pressures. The Reddit discussion revealed deep concerns among retail investors. One highly-upvoted comment captured the anxiety: “AI is literally replacing entire departments now, not just individual roles. This is different from past layoff cycles.” Another trader noted, “They’re cutting 30K jobs while spending $35B on AI infrastructure – the math doesn’t add up for workers but makes perfect sense for margins.” A third commenter expressed skepticism about the stock’s prospects: “How is AMZN supposed to run with the Mag 7 when they’re bleeding cash on capex and cutting their workforce? The growth story is broken.” Retail traders are turning skeptical despite solid fundamentals. The concerns are tangible: Amazon’s year-to-date return of 4.1% lags dramatically behind NVDA’s 27.5% one-year gain and GOOGL’s 67% surge. While 95% of Wall Street analysts rate Amazon a Buy with a $295 target price (26% upside), retail sentiment reflects anxiety over margin compression and AI spending. NVIDIA, by contrast, maintains a 55 sentiment score with 93% analyst support, backed by 67% earnings growth and a 53% profit margin that dwarfs Amazon’s 11.1%. For investors watching major tech stocks, Amazon’s isolation in negative sentiment is striking given its Q3 earnings beat and AWS reacceleration to 20% growth.

Title: Military Jammers Market Report 2026-2030: Terrorism Rise Spurs Demand, with Revenues Reaching $9 Billion by 2030

Time Published: 2026-01-26T11:06:00Z

January 26, 2026 06:06 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 26, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Military Jammer Market Report 2026" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Global trade dynamics and tariffs are major influencers in the military jammers market, impacting component costs and production timelines. Notably, sectors such as electronic and radar jammers, especially those utilizing GaN technology from Asia-Pacific, face challenges. However, this has also spurred domestic manufacturing, promoting R&D in efficient jamming solutions and enhancing local sourcing. Opportunities for self-reliance and innovation continue to emerge. The military jammer market has experienced significant growth, projected to expand from $6.24 billion in 2025 to $6.73 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 7.8%. This upward trend is driven by increased deployment of communications jammers, the advancement of radar warning receivers, expansion of infrared jammers, and the growing need for drone jammers in response to unmanned aerial threats. By 2030, the market is expected to reach $9.05 billion, growing at a CAGR of 7.7%, fueled by the development of next-gen adaptive jamming technologies and the rise of electronic warfare modernization. Terrorist activities, characterized by the use of violence to achieve ideological aims, have increased demand for military jamming systems. In February 2024, a report by The Institute for Economics and Peace noted an increase in the lethality of terrorist attacks in 2023, further propelling market growth. The demand for technologies that disrupt terrorist communications and safeguard against attacks continues to rise. Technology adoption remains a key trend, and companies are enhancing their portfolios with advanced mitigation technologies tailored for military use. For example, Leonardo introduced the BriteStorm stand-in jammer, enhancing electronic warfare capabilities against sophisticated defense systems. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions like Rockaway Capital's acquisition of URC Systems underscore the industry's drive toward broadening defense technology offerings in light of global geopolitical shifts.

Title: Clients Are Holding Highly Leveraged ETFs Way Too Long

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority recently released data that found most investors aren’t using leveraged ETPs properly. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Sometimes, you just have to let it go. Leveraged exchange-traded products have been all the rage in recent months, with almost 60 new filings for funds that track companies like Google, Robinhood and Uber coming online in October alone. Total assets in leveraged US equity ETFs hit $125B as of Dec. 25, up from $106B at the end of 2024, according to Morningstar Direct. Across the pond, three of the top 10 most traded ETPs on the London Stock Exchange featured 3X leverage strategies, including the top traded fund in December: the Leverage Shares 3x Tesla ETP. Now, a UK securities regulator is raising red flags. The Financial Conduct Authority recently released data on how the products are being used by advisors and retail investors alike, and (you guessed it) most investors aren’t using them as intended. “Some consumers may intentionally hold these products longer as part of their investment strategy,” the authors of the report wrote. “But others may not fully understand the recommended holding periods, or the risks involved.” The review of 11 firms, including wealth managers and direct-to-consumer platforms, found 82% of trades were held longer than the recommended one-day window. In other words, investors forgot to read the fine print, just skimmed it or treated it like directions on assembling an Ikea coffee table. Some other problem areas included: To be sure, the regulator has no plans to ban the products, but it does expect firms to be far more intentional about who gets access to them. If harm is identified, the FCA said it expects firms to take proactive steps rather than wait for regulators to come knocking. “Complex ETPs that are held longer than intended are particularly susceptible to tracking errors due to daily price resets, increasing the potential for unexpected losses,” the FCA wrote. “Distributors should define and regularly review their target market for complex products at a granular level.” Hold On a Sec: While there are 3X funds trading in the states, US regulators aren’t thrilled with the flood of new highly leveraged products. The Securities and Exchange Commission sent warning letters to nine issuers in December — including Direxion, GraniteShares and ProShares — effectively stopping the review process for new funds with more than 2x exposure. “Regularly review the value your products provide,” the FCA wrote. “Where you identify issues or poor outcomes, we expect firms to take appropriate action, such as adjusting pricing or restricting access where necessary.” The actively managed fund is designed to generate additional income via call options. Forgoing mutual funds or direct stocks altogether makes sense for some, experts say. The $18 billion issuer has become the first to ask regulators to make existing shares of an ETF available on the blockchain. The move may fundamentally change how trading works, but will it offer a real advantage or just endless hours of marginal activity? Gen Z currently prefers individual stocks, but those that do own ETFs value advisor recommendations more highly. Retail investors can get private assets in a few ETFs, but there are limits on how much is in the portfolios and questions about valuations. Inflows to crypto ETFs are expected to continue this year, but stablecoins and tokenization will be areas to watch. Guggenheim Investments, which sold its US ETF line nine years ago, filed for six active funds, including an ultrashort bond product. Stocks in banks with big credit card businesses dipped Monday and Tuesday, and ETFs that invest in them were not immune. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Title: The Ancient Myths and Medieval Legends of the Vast Russian Forest

A man rows a canoe along a broad, glassy river. As he approaches the sandy shore, he fires two shots from his rifle. Villagers rush to greet him and his honored guest: a bear. The hunter has already opened the bear’s coat in the forest and removed its shoes and gloves. In other words, he has skinned it. Women and children kiss the animal’s pelt, stroke its staring face, and implore it not to frighten them when they pick berries in the forest. The bear is lowered into a specially prepared house adorned with its favorite tree, a young Siberian pine. Now men sing songs of Torum, the forest’s god and the bear’s father. The soul of Torum’s son must be returned home with due pomp, so that he will not trouble the people who killed him. “Out of wood,” the men sing, “a gallant new man was created.” Like bears, humans depend on the forest for their existence. The people celebrating this ritual are Khanty who live near the Agan River, in northwestern Siberia. Their ancestors arrived in the region by 500 CE, long before a Slav ever set foot there. The bear’s arrival was captured in Sons of Torum, a 1989 film by an Estonian writer and filmmaker named Lennart Meri. In 1941, at age twelve, Meri had been exiled to the Volga River region after Stalin annexed Estonia. He later became fascinated by Uralic languages like Khanty and Mansi, which are related to Hungarian and, more distantly, to Finnish and Estonian. The members of this far-­flung linguistic family shared more than vocabulary; they were united by a history of domination by Russia. Sons of Torum is an ode to survival and return. Meri became the second president of newly independent Estonia in 1992, bringing the memory of Siberia’s forests to the highest rungs of Estonia’s government. In 2006, he was buried in Tallinn’s Forest Cemetery, where Estonian luminaries rest eternally among the trees. The Khanty bear ceremony survived encounters first with imperial Russian missionaries and colonizers, then with forced Soviet modernization, collectivization, and executions. Some of the earliest information about Khanty religious traditions comes from Russian priests who sent their reports to the archbishop of Siberia to alert him to the problem of continued paganism. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, ethnographers became fascinated by the bear ceremony. Finnish and Hungarian visitors were particularly attracted by the linguistic link to their own languages. It was mind-­boggling to think that one branch of the same population had ended up in the baroque palaces of Budapest while another had remained hunter-­fisher-­gatherers in the remote northern forests. The dream of living in absolute freedom in the woods, following a lifestyle not so different from that of hunter-­fisher-­gatherers, recurs again and again in Russian history—­which has a habit of relapsing into the distant past. The strange kinship had a whiff of alternative history: What would have happened if Hungarians had never adopted agriculture, never become owners of grand estates, never built cities? Well into the twentieth century, the Khanty relied for their survival on their reindeer herds and on the gifts of the forest and rivers: berries and pine nuts, dried and smoked fish, frozen meat, dried birds. Their forest lifeway still resembled societies that existed across northern Eurasia for millennia. Once upon a time, the people living in this area were at the vanguard of human development. A few hundred kilometers northwest of the river where Meri filmed, a sandy elevated spit overlooks the vast expanse of the West Siberian plain. Whorls of Siberian pine, spruce, and larch cede to brown, squelching swamp. This stretch of forest is the last before the beginning of Arctic tundra to the north. It is traced with wide, slow rivers, still the principal routes of transport for the Khanty and other Indigenous people—­by boat in summer, and in winter, along the ice. White moss, food for reindeer, foams on the ground beneath the trees. This remote expanse of taiga hardly seems like a cradle of human innovation. Today, it sits squarely in the middle of nowhere. Yet it contains one of the oldest-­known fortified settlements in the world. The Amnya site, named for the nearby river of that name, has astonished the archaeology world and helped overturn assumptions about how societies progress over time, changing from peaceful hunter-­gatherer communities to agrarian societies characterized by private property, social inequality, and warfare. Radiocarbon dating published in 2023 shows that the fortifications were built eight thousand years ago—­almost five thousand years earlier than researchers had thought such settlements were first established in the region, and many centuries before the appearance of similar forts in Europe. The tiny, wooded citadel is the northernmost Stone Age stronghold anywhere in Eurasia. It survived in part because the area’s forest, too cold and swampy for agriculture, has never been plowed. Up to the present day, the Indigenous people living nearby have refrained from building over the visible house pits. According to their traditional cosmology, digging is dangerous, because it risks disturbing the spirits of the lower world. This fortified settlement, and numerous similar, more recent promontory forts in the Ob River region, offer a tantalizing riddle for archaeologists. Why did Neolithic people need forts in the first place? What were these fortifications meant to protect, at a time long before trade? And how did Neolithic hunter-­fisher-­gatherers manage to construct this monumental architecture so deep in the northern forest, in a place that even today is seventeen hours by car from the nearest major Russian city? There is clearly something exceptional about the Ob River basin. The area shows evidence of continuous habitation since the Neolithic period. A former riverbed nearby, abandoned by the larger river-­course and reduced to a dead-­end lake, provides one clue. This area is known even today for its abundant fish. It is home to pike, perch, and whitefish, as well as exotic, fatty northern fish of the salmonid family: tender, silvery muksun, white-­fleshed nelma, and the hucho taimen, which makes for delectable “taiga sushi,” as Henny Piezonka, a German archaeologist studying the Amnya site, described it. With its blue-­green head and luminous, sunset-­colored tail, the taimen is so big that Chinese and Mongolian legends render it as a kind of sea monster. The so-­called river wolf or river tiger is known to prey on rats, ducks, and muskrats, though it usually hunts other fish. It can grow to be up to six feet long and one hundred pounds, and it can live for fifty-­five years. The taimen makes the Amnya site look modern: It has existed for fifty million years. Archaeologists suspect that the Amnya settlement was built to store and protect the bounty caught in this relict lake, which is a perfect place to fish using a weir, an underwater fence. The Khanty and Selkup, another Indigenous group in the area, still fish using weirs—­as Piezonka put it, “technology perfected eight thousand years ago.” Sons of Torum shows how Khanty men strip pine roots with their knives and teeth, smoothing them until they are supple as leather. The roots are used to bind wooden laths, forming a screen to trap fish in a lake after they swim in during the spring. In the autumn, when it becomes cold enough to preserve them, the fish can be pulled out of the water without the aid of lines or nets. Such piscine bounty demanded new ways of living. A weir cannot be abandoned for a season. It requires year-­round maintenance, as well as protection from enemies and wild animals such as bears. A weir could make the difference between a well-­fed winter and death by starvation. This explains why nomadic or seminomadic hunter-­gatherers chose to build a fortress on the riverbank and commit to settling down. The strong but flexible roots of the Siberian pine, woven into a weir, bound them to a single place. The Neolithic hunter-­fisher-­gatherers lived relatively well. Like the Khanty as late as the twentieth century, they hunted forest animals and ate preserved fish in winter; in spring, they turned to migratory birds arriving from the south; in autumn, they caught fish and elk migrating from the other side of the Ural Mountains. The beginning of the Neolithic period was the moment when people began to use ceramic vessels as well as wooden ones, and this area near the Amnya is the first place in the region where pottery has been found. Before ceramics, containers were made of birch bark, which can be used for baking but cannot be held over an open flame. Clay pottery made it possible to simmer, a process essential to making fish oil or fish glue, and to store food safely over long periods. (The local Indigenous people still make fish glue from pike bones.) The taiga’s long stretches of subzero weather, meanwhile, allowed the Neolithic people to freeze meat and oils. The accumulation of precious food opened new possibilities for social organization. Inequality resulted, as did property rights and collective projects such as the construction of the fort. And there was war. Fish oil and fish meal, easy to store and transport but requiring much labor in its acquisition and preparation, was an appealing target for raiders. The Amnya complex shows evidence of the first stone arrowheads in the region, contemporaneous with the emergence of fortified settlements. Archaeologists suggest that they were used for war rather than hunting. This warfare may have been a product not only of competition for existing resources but also of prehistoric climate change. Around 6200–­6050 BCE, the climate cooled, causing population movements and prompting hunter-­gatherers around northern Eurasia to mark their territory in novel ways; hunter-­gatherers in Russian Karelia, at the border of present-­day Finland, began to use formal cemeteries. Away from their fortified home, the taiga dwellers built small structures and made offerings, depositing stone arrowheads and pottery decorated with the sculpted heads of birds and animals. The worshippers set the structures alight and then heaped them with soil, pouring out vivid red ochre to close the ceremony. As the ritual was repeated, red hills grew; they contain animal bones, antlers, and human skulls. The hills prefigure the burial mounds of the Scythian warrior-­nomads of Siberia as well as the festive bonfires of the pagan Slavs—­a tradition that continues even today. The Amnya site’s rustling, wet expanse of trees and swamp has yielded a new understanding of human progress. The establishment of agriculture is still widely considered to be an essential step on the road to social “complexity”: accumulation, private property, social hierarchies, economic inequality, military conquest. The Neolithic Amnya fort shows that warfare and surplus economies can be sustained for millennia without agriculture, and that hunter-­fisher-gatherers, who have often been imagined as primitive and peaceful, may have been more warlike and more sophisticated than scientific tradition had assumed. Even in the 2020s, the Siberian forest murmurs with startling secrets. It is a treasure chest, a hiding place, a fortress. The dream of living in absolute freedom in the woods, following a lifestyle not so different from that of hunter-­fisher-­gatherers, recurs again and again in Russian history—­which has a habit of relapsing into the distant past. In the prehistoric period, the taiga’s fish determined the course of human civilization. During the medieval era, it was the taiga’s furs that would reshape Eurasian economies and societies. During that period, fortifications around the Ob River served as safe storage points for the precious sable pelts collected by Indigenous hunters—­Khanty, Mansi, Selkup, and Nenets—­who sold them to traders or surrendered them as tribute. The mysterious northern forests of Siberia and northern Russia were renowned throughout medieval Eurasia as the source of furs that were traded as far as China, Italy, and North Africa, coveted by monarchs and aristocrats, traders and warlords. Archaeologists have found Persian Sassanid silver, ornate Byzantine vessels, and Chinese coins at forts in the Ob River basin, which was a spur of the Silk Road. Fur first became fashionable in the Islamic world. In the tenth century, Arab rulers and European kings wore dresses made of black and red fox fur. The very best fur, the most gorgeous pelts in the purest tints, came from northern European Russia and from northwestern Siberia, which became known to the Islamic world as “the land of darkness.” By the eleventh century, Europe’s monarchs, lords and ladies were draping themselves in sable, ermine, and “vair,” squirrel fur sewn into heraldic patterns. Later, they trimmed their brightly colored woolen clothes in gray and white “minever,” another name for squirrel. The fashion caught on among merchants and craftsmen. In 1327 England restricted fur-­wearing to royalty and people of “high birth with incomes over 100 pounds per annum.” The effort failed, and upwardly mobile English people continued to deck their ambition in animal pelts. As western Europe hacked down its forests to make way for agriculture, its taste for fur only grew. The most desirable gray-­blue and white winter squirrel pelts, favorites of Henry III and Edward I of England, came from Scandinavia and northern Russia. The Siberian forests, still nearly untouched, were a treasure trove. Fur could be exchanged for silver, fine woolen textiles, salt, and other luxury goods. It could even be a tool of diplomacy, sent to foreign rulers as a gesture of goodwill. For centuries, furs were by far the most valuable commodity coming from the dark northern lands, and one of the most valuable luxury goods circulating in Eurasia. The fur trading network reached as far as Spain, North Africa, China, and India. Once small groups of hunter-­gatherers had fought over fish meal in the taiga; now states and armies across Eurasia competed for fur. Controlling the fur trade depended on controlling the people who knew best how to trap the elusive sable, ermine, squirrel, and other creatures. But who were these expert hunters? Thanks to the fur trade, the peoples of the northern Eurasian forests were vaguely known as far away as Central Asia and China. The first accounts of the people dwelling on the southern edges of Siberia are from Chinese chronicles rather than Russian ones. The word taiga (the stress comes on the final “a”), synonymous with Siberia’s forests today, is not a Russian word but a Turkic name that comes from these earlier encounters with the forest peoples. Ethnography began as a means of gathering information essential to trade and war. In the northern forests, fur was the center of every story, the logic that shaped every intercultural interaction. The forest and its inhabitants sparked the imagination of the era’s travel writers, who did not restrain their fancy. The twelfth-century Muslim traveler Abū Hāmid described one of the Islamic world’s first fur sources: “On the sea is an area of darkness, known under the name Iura.” The people of Iura (a name for the Indigenous people of western Siberia) have no war and no animals for transportation, “only huge trees and forests in which there is a lot of honey, and they have a lot of sables.” The forest provides for all their needs. In the summer the sun does not set for forty days, and in the winter the night lasts for forty days—­a nightmare for Muslims, whose religious practices depend on more regular cycles. Most striking is Abū Hāmid’s description of Iura’s trade: The merchants say that the land of darkness is not far from them and that the people of Iura go to this land of darkness and enter it with torches and find there a large tree not unlike a large village, and in it is a large animal, which, they say, is a bird. They bring goods with them, and each merchant puts his property down in a separate place, makes his sign on it and goes away. Then after a while they return and find goods that are needed in their country. And each man finds some of those things near his own goods; if he agrees, then he takes them; if not, he gathers his own things and leaves the others and no exchange takes place. And they do not know from whom they are buying these goods. The single large tree, with its single bird inhabitant, represents the huge, frightening treasure chest of the taiga. It yields its riches only to the initiated, who trade their furs through a string of mysterious middlemen. The process is opaque enough to seem mythical. The Eastern Slavs, too, imagined the fur-­collecting peoples of the north as creatures from a fairytale. In the Primary Chronicle of 1096, the writer recounts a story told to him by a certain Giuriata Rogovich of Novgorod. According to Rogovich, the Iugra (an alternate version of “Iura”), Indigenous people of northwestern Siberia, described mountains that reached from the heavens to the sea. From the mountains, the Iugra said, could be heard the sound of voices, people cutting their way out of the rock. Though their language was incomprehensible, it was somehow evident that the people in the mountain were asking for more iron. In exchange, they would trade furs to the Iugra. But most of the year, the route to these mysterious mountain dwellers was impassable thanks to forest, snow, and precipices. Beneath its fabulously improbable surface, this medieval game of telephone likely contains several kernels of truth. Travelers of the period exaggerated all their tales of unfamiliar peoples. But by telling this story, the Iugra may have been discouraging the Slavs from establishing direct contact with their trading partners, or from attempting to extract the forest’s riches themselves. The Iugra had good reason to protect their status as middlemen, which brought profit and safety. For several centuries, they would succeed in preserving their land of darkness from the incursions of Russian colonizers. The city-­state of Novgorod was an early seat of Slavic power, existing from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries. At its peak, it stretched from the Baltics to the Urals. Its capital city was built with the wood of the surrounding forests. Oak, lime, and elm were used for the most valuable structures; the more abundant pine, spruce, and birch served for everything else. Novgorod was a forest transmuted into a society, a kingdom of woodworking. It grew rich from its forests, where precious furs were so abundant that medieval visitors to Novgorod reported silky-­coated animals falling from the sky. The Novgorodians were the first Slavic people to conquer the northern forest west of the Urals. Beginning in the eleventh century, they forced the Komi, natives of northeastern European Russia who are distantly related to the Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians, to bring them fur tribute. Now the native hunters were not traders exchanging pelts for weapons, metals, and other goods, as in the fanciful tales about the Iura/Iugra, but subjects paying tax to Slavic lords. A fifteenth-­century account of an exploratory trip into Siberia by Novgorodian merchants in search of fur, “On unknown men in the eastern land,” describes the peoples encountered along the way. These sketches are outlandish and clearly fanciful, drawing on a long-­standing tradition of European myths about semihuman tribes. The first group are described as cannibals who serve their own children as a welcome meal for the visiting merchants. But other descriptions can be read as a kind of magical ethnography. One group lives in the sea for a month every year as its people shed their old skins and grow new ones—­perhaps a reference to the practice of wearing fish leather, common among northern peoples, and to seasonal migration. Another tribe is mouthless. Its mute members eat by putting food under their caps and chewing with their shoulders—­a highly embroidered version of a people who speak a language unintelligible to the merchants or their interpreters. Another group dies for two months every winter, then returns to life. This is simply hibernation: a merging of humans with bears. The historian Janet Martin has pointed out that this story was not pure invention: The locations of the peoples described and the indication of who had sable were accurate. Ethnography began as a means of gathering information essential to trade and war. In the northern forests, fur was the center of every story, the logic that shaped every intercultural interaction. __________________________________ Excerpt from The Oak and the Larch: A Forest History of Russia and Its Empires.

Title: Job Slaughter Accelerates: January 2026 Corporate Layoffs Signal Economic Implosion
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2026-01-26-job-slaughter-accelerates-january-2026-corporate-layoffs.html
Time Published: 2026-01-26T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
The American economic mirage is shattering. As the nation enters 2026, a chilling corporate offensive is accelerating, transforming the post-holiday landscape into a bloodbath for the working class. This is not a routine economic adjustment; it is the sound of systemic collapse, a coordinated corporate retreat from the very human capital upon which national prosperity was built. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8].

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Trader William Lawrence works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Monday, while other markets made louder moves, including another record-breaking rush for the price of gold. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and won back its losses from last week’s dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 313 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The energy technology company said it’s benefiting from strong momentum in demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.62 points to 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 313.69 to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 100.11 to 23,601.36. The action was stronger in the gold market, where the metal’s price rallied another 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time to set another record. Silver surged even more and settled 14% higher. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The latest worry to pile atop the swelling list was President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods from Canada if it signs a free trade deal with China. The U.S. dollar’s value also continued its recent slide against peers. Last week, it was U.S. tariff threats related to Greenland that drove some global investors away from the dollar. This time, it was the Japanese yen leaping sharply because of expectations that officials in both Japan and the United States may intervene in the market to prop up the Japanese currency’s value. More swings could be ahead for financial markets in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates on Wednesday. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Most economists expect it to hold steady on Wednesday, in part because inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Whatever the Fed decides, comments from its chair, Jerome Powell, following the decision could sway stock and bond markets. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver their latest earnings reports this week. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.21% from 4.24% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements in Europe following some sharper swings in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% for one of the world’s bigger moves. A stronger yen could hurt Japanese exporters, and Toyota Motor fell 4.1%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, attended the premiere of "Melania," a $40 million documentary about the first lady, with President Donald Trump on Saturday night as his reporters begged him not to make steep cuts to the legendary newsroom, according to a new report. David Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent, reported on Sunday that WaPo's international correspondents sent Bezos a letter pleading with him to maintain the paper's international coverage. The letter was sent as speculation was building that large-scale layoffs were imminent at the paper. "We urge you to consider how these proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable," the letter reads in part. The letter was sent the day after Bezos attended the White House movie night. According to Folkenflik, Melania Trump was paid the "lion's share" of the $40 million licensing fee for Amazon Prime, which is owned by Bezos, to produce the documentary. Trump has become increasingly hostile to the press during his second term. He has called publications that report on his health "illegal" and said they should be shut down.

UPDATED 11:33 EST / JANUARY 25 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we team up with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s prognostication follows the publication where we grade our 2025 predictions. In this Breaking Analysis, we tap some of the most telling nuggets from ETR’s rich data set and put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025. Most of the predictions below are backed up with data based on proprietary market intelligence from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey (TSIS) and its quarterly macro drill-down data, which surveys more than 1,700 business technology leaders. Each year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and categorize them. Every year the folder gets larger. In the graphic below we show the mix of topic areas. Of course everything is artificial intelligence, but we’ve tried to isolate those that were AI-specific. As always, security is top of mind for forecasters, as you can see with 25% of the inbounds. Our predictions this year span information technology spending, AI return on investment, Nvidia Corp.’s moat, data, large language models, cloud, changes to the software-as-a-service model, security, hardware pricing and the memory shortag, and the impact of AI on jobs. Let’s dive into the detail. The first prediction is: IT budgets rise about 5% in 2026. Since COVID, organizations have dealt with sustained pressure on IT budgets as interest rates rose and uncertainty dominated. Geopolitical tensions, wars, tariffs and related shocks have kept decision-makers cautious. Against that backdrop, ETR’s quarterly macro drill-down shows IT decision makers currently expecting a 4.6% budget increase. The call at 5% is a modest step above the mean, with notable divergence in large enterprises – they remain more conservative at under 4% – while the C-suite and Asia-Pacific respondents are more optimistic. The data is moving in the right direction. The forward spending outlook has improved meaningfully versus earlier surveys, with a notable jump from the first October survey when respondents were asked for the first time about forward spend into January. In the current survey, 74% of respondents indicate they plan to increase spending, the highest level since January 2022. This suggests the optimism is not isolated to a single segment. The large-enterprise caution is a concern, however, but even within the Fortune 500, the trend is improving, rising by more than a percentage point survey-over-survey. The C-suite cut comes in above the mean at 5.2%, reinforcing that senior leadership sentiment is leaning more aggressively toward growth than the broader population. An important nuance is what this metric represents. This is IT budget data – not vendor revenue. It includes staffing and related internal costs and should not be conflated with market forecasts from firms such as IDC and Gartner forecasting vendor revenue growth. Over time, budgets are likely to evolve as the data center buildout expands access to token-based services and as organizations scale up with less headcount. Staffing is one of the largest line items in IT budgets, and AI-driven productivity and automation will influence that mix going forward. The near-term focus, however, is the 2026 budget direction of roughly 5%, reflected in the survey. The second prediction is that 2026 becomes the year enterprises start seeing AI ROI at scale. In prior years, our prediction was that ROI would remain elusive. The data is now moving in a different direction, with signs of a productivity increasing and more evidence that enterprises are beginning to operationalize AI in ways that sustain returns. The ROI story is aligning around two themes: 1) Measurement discipline and 2) Scaling outcomes. Early in the cycle, organizations were spending heavily while a large portion of the market either was not measuring ROI or had not seen any return. In November 2024, combining “not measuring ROI” with “had not seen ROI” put the total near 50%, a concerning gap between investment intensity and financial confidence. That gap is narrowing. The most important shift is that more organizations are measuring ROI. The share that is not measuring dropped from 27% to 18%, and a rise in financial-operations adoption in the ETR data signals that enterprises are putting cost controls and accountability structures around AI spending. Six to eight months ago, FinOps barely surfaced in insights panels and interviews. Now it is showing up constantly, which tracks with a market moving from experimentation to governance and operational rigor. The data also shows incremental improvement in realized ROI bands. The 1% to 10% ROI bucket has fluctuated but has steadily increased since November 2024. That supports the view that organizations are beginning to realize returns and are learning how to align AI initiatives with measurable outcomes. A key nuance is what enterprises expect ROI to be. In the ETR AI series data, 66% of respondents say AI ROI comes from cost efficiency and margin improvement. Only 23% expect ROI to come from revenue growth or new product creation. That distribution is relevant because it explains why FinOps is rising and why measurement is becoming central. If most ROI is expected to come from margin and efficiency, auditing and control of usage and spend becomes a prerequisite for declaring success. The third prediction comes out of research published earlier this month following Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at CES. The call is that Nvidia widens its lead over the broader graphics processing unit/tensor processing unit/application-specific integrated circuit pack because its cost per token advantage improves materially in 2026. A key factor is Nvidia’s CES disclosure that its latest GPU Vera Rubin is in full production and will ramp this year. The data shared at CES pointed to a rapid step-function improvement over Blackwell delivered in roughly 12 months: 5X performance, 10X throughput, and a 10X improvement in token cost. That combination of higher output and far lower unit costs is expected to drive a significant uptake in demand. The demand premise is based on Jevons Paradox – as price declines, consumption rises – and the prediction is that the cost-per-token reduction contributes to a 15X increase in demand. Against that backdrop, we expect the narrative that TPUs and ASICs are eroding Nvidia’s moat will itself erode, and the expectation is that Nvidia’s financial metrics will will reflect the magnitude of this advantage. Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio is hovering in the mid-20s – even lower than Walmart – and that multiple increases as investors internalize the sustainability of Nvidia’s position. It’s possible and even likely that some GPU designers will pivot to edge use cases or cancel programs. Looking ahead, our expectation is that Nvidia faces effectively no competition in the data center except where demand cannot be met. That unmet demand supports alternatives, but the path for competitors goes through inference and workloads at the edge. Our view is that Nvidia also performs well at the edge, with the addition of a lock-up a deal with Groq. Demand continues to outstrip supply, which means suppliers broadly sell what they can ship. The implication is that the best news for competitors is the current “rising tide” environment lifts all chip boats, and suppliers have little incentive to see that dynamic change soon. We believe data gravity increasingly benefits database platform incumbents as enterprises build AI capabilities on top of their existing ecosystems. Using Snowflake Inc. as an example, the data suggests that add-on services to a core data platform – like Cortex – become a natural extension of the underlying database. The core platform remains sticky, and that stickiness increases as customers pull adjacent workloads into the same ecosystem. This dynamic applies to other major incumbents, including Databricks Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp, but the trend is more pronounced with Snowflake customers. This chart above has two parts that reinforce the prediction. Specifically, when teams build AI applications, they tend to stay close to the database ecosystem where their data already lives – and that shows up in spending intentions. Starting on the right-hand graphic: This comes from ETR’s build-versus-buy AI series and looks only at respondents who say they are building their own AI applications. The y-axis is Paired Usage Likelihood Impact, which is a way of showing how strongly two components show up together in the same tech stack. Using Snowflake as the clearest example in this cut, the chart shows that when customers adopt Snowflake Cortex Search, they are far more likely to adopt additional Snowflake components. Specifically: In our view, this is the data gravity effect in practice. Once a customer is anchored in a Snowflake-led workflow for one element of the AI stack, the probability increases that adjacent elements – search, vector search or vector database style capabilities, and model-related components – remain inside the same ecosystem. Now move to the left-hand graphic: This is from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey and shows Snowflake Net Score (spending momentum) trends over time across three categories that relate to this prediction: Each cluster shows snapshots over five time points spanning from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026. The chart headline says it all: “Gains in Database and Analytics drives aggregate Snowflake recovery.” The data suggests a meaningful rebound in Snowflake’s core database and analytics momentum showing up in 2026, with Database/Data Warehousing notably jumping back up versus the prior quarters, and Analytics showing a similar recovery pattern. ML/AI remains elevated but comparatively steadier across the period. The bottom line is that we see a pull toward the incumbent’s database ecosystem when organizations are building their own AI applications. Snowflake is the clearest example in this dataset. When customers are using Snowflake for one layer of their stack, they are more likely to stay in the Snowflake ecosystem for adjacent capabilities including search, vector search, vector database and foundational model usage combined with other stack elements. This in our view highlights the predictive value of the ETR dataset as a leading indicator. In prior market shifts, Breaking Analysis observed survey data that flagged early movement, including the work-from-home wave and its impact on vendors such as CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., Okta Inc. and Zscaler Inc. We have seen similar leading signals in the rise of Snowflake and Databricks, periods of softening that preceded market repricing and subsequent rebounds. The data suggests the current resurgence is part of that same pattern of early signal preceding broader market recognition. The message is that platform incumbency is compounding in the sense that as enterprises build AI applications, they consolidate more of the stack around the database ecosystem they already trust, and the data suggests Snowflake is currently the clearest beneficiary of that gravity with a measurable resurgence in spending intent. We believe 2026 is the inflection year where leading model providers optimize around enterprise adoption, not just model benchmarks and consumer buzz. Our bet is that OpenAI follows Anthropic’s enterprise posture more aggressively, uses consumer scale as leverage, and exits 2026 with enterprise revenue that surpasses Anthropic’s. In parallel, we expect OpenAI to pressure Google’s search economics, and we expect Elon Musk’s Grok to pursue edge-oriented opportunities where he already has a strategic footprint. The chart above shows where model and AI platforms sit inside enterprise accounts today, using two dimensions from ETR’s TSIS. First, read the plots. Each dot is a vendor. The x-axis is Overlap %, which we use here as a proxy for pervasion and account penetration across the dataset. The y-axis is Shared Net Score, which represents spending momentum among the accounts where the vendor is present. The red dotted line at 40% is the “highly elevated momentum” threshold. The upper-right corner is the power position indicating high penetration and high momentum. That is where Microsoft and OpenAI Group PBC sit in the January 2026 survey and have for some time. Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC are clustered close together in the upper-middle portion, reflecting strong momentum and meaningful overlap. Databricks and Snowflake sit near one another as well, which fits our prior prediction on data gravity and platform pull-through. Anthropic PBC is high on the y-axis with strong momentum, sitting above the red line with notable progress since last year. Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama is well below the threshold and has fallen out of the leadership conversation in this dataset (and the market) relative to the leaders. In the lower-left are the legacy machine learning and AI players fighting for relevance on both overlap and momentum. Second, use the table on the right to anchor the scatter with exact numbers. For JAN26 Shared Net Score and Shared N, Anthropic leads at 72.5% (345), followed by Microsoft at 65.5% (795) and OpenAI at 60.7% (677). Databricks comes in at 58.8% (250). AWS and Google are tied at 58.0% with Shared N of 450 and 483, respectively. Snowflake is at 47.5% (265) and Meta Llama at 29.9% (137). Pervasion on the x-axis is the leading indicator to watch as this shifts from experimentation to enterprise standardization. OpenAI is already near 40% pervasion versus Anthropic at roughly 20%, while most other players remain in single digits. Anthropic doubled pervasion from about 10% to 20% in a year, but OpenAI’s starting position is meaningfully more entrenched inside enterprise environments. That penetration advantage is relevant to our prediction because we believe it makes the consumer volume a feature for enterprise, not a bug. OpenAI’s distribution, usage patterns and familiar interface create gravity that increasingly supports enterprise use cases and API-driven deployments. Recent data suggests that OpenAI’s API added more than $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate last month alone, which reflects enterprise-driven revenue generation and evidence the platform is moving beyond a consumer chatbot phase. In our view, once that enterprise flywheel starts spinning, it continues to gain momentum. On Google, our prediction extends beyond model performance, where Gemini has made truly impressive strides. We believe OpenAI’s recent moves around advertising are aimed at pressuring Google’s core economics. Search queries cost fractions of pennies, AI queries are far more expensive (100X), and we expect OpenAI to keep testing ways to insert itself and disrupt Google’s advertising economics. Though Microsoft’s earlier attempts to AI-ify Bing did not deliver the intended results, we believe OpenAI’s scale and positioning give it a better chance. On Grok, we expect a push to the edge. Elon had explored designing a data center GPU, then backed away from that path as Nvidia’s lead became more obvious. At the same time, Tesla Inc. already operates with an edge-oriented chip design capability built around Arm and customized neural processing units, or NPUs, for vehicles. We believe Grok strengthens that position, with continued silicon innovation focused at the edge while xAI Holdings Corp. scales data center capacity rapidly in Memphis – with a high priority position in Nvidia’s allocation queue. Longer-term, theCUBE Research work by George Gilbert and David Floyer suggests that leading LLM companies could evolve into a new breed of software delivered through application programming interfaces, making adoption easier for enterprises without deep engineering chops. We do not expect that full transformation to be obvious in 2026, but we believe it ties directly to the multiyear shift from legacy IT spend toward token generation and more AI-ified operating models. The message is that enterprise penetration and spending momentum are converging around a small set of leaders, and the data suggests OpenAI has the distribution advantage to translate consumer scale into enterprise-standard deployments, with Anthropic setting the pace on momentum, and Google and AWS clustered tightly – Google having the advantage in proprietary models — and Grok positioning for edge-driven differentiation over time. We believe Google Cloud Platform continues closing the gap on AWS and Azure in 2026, driven primarily by its prowess in AI, reinforced by a world-class data foundation, and supported by improving profitability. As shown below, while GCP still trails in enterprise penetration, the leading indicators in spending intent suggest momentum is shifting in Google’s favor, particularly inside large enterprises. Google Cloud Platform is showing sustained momentum. The starting point is growth and operating leverage. By our estimates, GCP grew roughly 40% last quarter. Alphabet discloses Google Cloud overall rather than GCP specifically, but we believe GCP is growing meaningfully faster than the consolidated cloud segment. At the same time, Google Cloud operating margins have moved into the black and are now in the mid-20s, and moving in a direction we see as increasingly encouraging for a scaled cloud business. In our opinion, those margins continue to expand as the business matures, and that translates into meaningful cash generation over time. The ETR data above reinforces the momentum. In the core spending intent datasets, GCP is the only one of the Big Three cloud providers showing year-over-year Net Score acceleration, while AWS and Azure both declined. Penetration remains lower – pervasion trails those two, particularly versus Azure – but the direction of spend intent is moving up. The spending intent improvements are not confined to smaller accounts. The increase shows up in Fortune 100, Fortune 500 and Global 2000 cohorts, which historically have been harder for Google to penetrate. We believe that shift reflects Google’s broader enterprise prowess – more credibility with the largest organizations and more proof points that GCP can run mission-critical workloads at scale. ETR’s AI series data provides more evidence to explain why this is happening now. We see rising usage across Google’s AI build stack, including Gemini and Vertex AI, with gains survey over survey. In our view, Google’s positioning as both a foundational model provider and a cloud hosting platform is becoming more integrated, and that integration is beginning to show up in customer behavior. We also believe Google’s approach has benefited from patience. The company has the capital to play a longer game. As operating margins climb toward the levels sustained by AWS over many quarters – and as Azure continues to benefit from software contribution – we expect Google to keep expanding profitability while it builds share. That is the combination that changes perception with accelerating demand plus improving margins. The message is that Google’s cloud business is entering a new phase where AI-led demand, improving enterprise traction and expanding operating margins work together, and the survey data suggests GCP is the only Big Three provider accelerating on Net Score while extending its relevance with the largest global organizations. We believe 2026 marks a transition year for software-as-a-service monetization. Seat-based pricing has been misaligned with customer value for a long time, and AI amplifies that tension by changing how work gets done and how many users need direct licenses. At the same time, SaaS vendors have deep entrenchment in enterprise process logic and trusted data, and in our view that gives them leverage to preserve and grow revenue even as seat growth moderates. The prediction is not a SaaS collapse. The prediction is that pricing evolves, with a shift toward outcome-based and AI-inclusive monetization showing up in the numbers. The graphic above is a two-parter designed to answer the question “Does AI reduce SaaS seats, and if it does, does revenue fall with it?” The top row focuses on seats. The bottom row focuses on spend offsets. Start with the top-left table: “AI Impact on Core Software Seats – NOV25 AI Product Series.” It breaks results by customer type and shows the percentage expecting more seats versus same seats versus less seats, then summarizes the net “seat offset.” The seat offset is positive for small and medium-sized businesses (+12%) and modestly positive for the total sample (+4%). It turns negative as you move upmarket to the Global 2000 (-1%), Large (-2%) and Fortune 500 (-8%). The message is that the biggest organizations are the ones most likely to see seat pressure. Now look to the top-right table: “Seat Offset Over Time.” It shows how that seat offset is trending from NOV24 to MAY25 to NOV25. The direction is consistent in that net seat impact is moving down over time, especially in larger cohorts. Global 2000 moves from +11% to +5% to -1%, and Large moves from +17% to +7% to -2%. Fortune 500 shifts from +6% to 0% to -8%. Seat growth is moderating, and in large enterprises it is flipping negative. Now move to the bottom-left table: “AI Spend Offset for Reductions in Seat Spending – NOV25 AI Product Series.” This is the follow-up question asking even if seats decline, does AI-related spend compensate? Respondents are asked whether AI spend will exceed, match, or fall short of any reduction in seat spend. In the Global 2000 row, 51% say AI spend exceeds the seat reduction, 33% say it matches, and 15% say it falls short. That pattern indicates monetization moving from seats toward AI and outcomes. Finally, bolster the conclusion with the bottom-right table: “AI Spend Net Impact Over Time.” This compresses the prior view into a single net impact metric over time. In NOV25, SMB shows 38%, Global 2000 shows 36%, and All Respondents shows 30%. Fortune 500 and Large are lower at 27% and 25% respectively, but still positive. Even in cohorts where seat offsets are negative, the net spend impact remains meaningfully positive. This is why we believe the market’s “SaaS is dead” and the “SaaS-Attack” narrative is overstated. Seat counts can be pressured while revenue grows if vendors successfully reprice around AI, usage and outcomes. We also believe the public commentary from large SaaS vendors aligns with this dynamic. Specifically, customers are asking for help operationalizing AI, and vendors are embedding AI into the products where data, metadata and business process logic already live. The message is that AI creates real headwinds for SaaS seat expansion, especially in the largest enterprises, but the spend data suggests SaaS vendors preserve and grow revenue by shifting monetization toward AI, usage and outcomes – a pricing evolution, not a SaaS collapse. We believe 2026 produces a new class of breach that most security teams are not prepared to contain — specifically, a major SaaS incident where no human credentials are stolen. Additionally, the attack vector is agentic, coordinated across multiple SaaS platforms, and executed by multiple AI agents from different vendors. The novelty is a logic hack, not a credential hack, set off by a prompt injection or agent-to-agent manipulation that redirects an agent’s behavior, spreads laterally via trusted integrations, and moves at machine speed across the digital supply chain. This prediction builds on a related warning from one of our inbounds that came from Shahar Man, CEO and co- founder of Backslash Security. In November 2025, he predicted, “A major MCP breach will define the AI coding threat model – We’ll see in 2026, the first large- scale breach originating from MCP.” What we saw with the Anthropic hack was related and supported the direction of Shahar’s prediction. We’re building on that prediction and expecting something broader. The breach we are forecasting involves one agent reprogramming another through prompt injection, then using MCP connections across SaaS platforms to jump domains – finance, HR, supply chain – potentially spanning multiple vendors and even multiple companies. In our view, agents become bridgeheads meaning once a nonhuman identity is granted access and can influence adjacent agents, the blast radius expands quickly. Some are referring to this as a polyagent breach, where the infection doesn’t just stay in one system. The security implication is disconcerting. Antivirus is blind to this class of attack because there is no traditional malware signature. Firewalls do not help because the agents are executing authorized actions within permitted domains. Phishing campaigns often take weeks or months to coordinate with humans. An agent-driven breach can propagate at machine speed, chaining together permissions and actions faster than human response loops can keep up. To defend this, organizations will need to put in things such as AI honeypot tokens to lure the bad agents, semantics that scan every agentic conversation, and much more sophisticated defense systems that most organizations won’t have in place in 2026. A credible path is identity-first controls and agent governance. Nonhuman identities require zero-trust security, full stop. They must be governed, continuously monitored and treated as untrusted by default. The risk is structural in that if one agent has access that was legitimately granted, and it can influence another agent, the effective access boundary expands beyond what the organization intended. The market is already signaling urgency. Within the CISO community, agentic AI governance, protection and security is again a top topic. Qualitative trend data suggests that identity-centric and zero-trust principles are among the top priorities, and the mandate is moving from theory to budget and operations. The vendor landscape is also shifting toward identity-centric consolidation and platform plays. The Palo Alto Networks Inc.-CyberArk Software Ltd. acquisition is a clear example of this direction. The practitioner requirement is for improved visibility, better decisioning based on data, and the ability to leverage identity intelligence as a defense mechanism. Security operations teams are already adopting agentic AI for triaging alerts and initial investigations, but the identity side is where the value becomes critical because identity is where the permissions live. This relates with a broader dynamic we track every year – tool sprawl and consolidation intent versus consolidation reality. Practitioners consistently express interest in reducing tool counts, but the data shows limited actual consolidation so far. That creates exposure. Platform vendors argue they are seeing consolidation power their business. Practitioners largely agree consolidation is desirable and also acknowledge it is not happening fast enough to reduce risk materially. The message here is that agentic systems expand the attack surface into a new domain where credentials are not stolen and malware is not planted, rather agent behavior is redirected. In our view, 2026 is the year this becomes visible in a major SaaS breach, and the organizations that are not operating identity-first, zero-trust governance for nonhuman identities are exposed to a class of risk that moves faster than their current defenses and operating models can respond. We believe hardware pricing remains elevated through 2026 and persists into 2027, driven by an ongoing memory shortage and a supply chain that is being reoriented around data center demand. High-bandwidth memory, NAND and RAM are in tight supply as data centers absorb capacity, and we expect that dynamic to keep pressure on pricing well beyond a normal cycle. In our view, this becomes a competitive differentiator for suppliers and OEMs that can secure allocation wins. Notably, buyers face a tougher refresh environment in 2026. The chart above captures two things: 1) How respondents say hardware prices have moved recently; and 2) How that pricing trend has shifted over time. Start with the distribution in the center. Respondents are asked: To what extent have vendors lowered or raised prices in the past six months compared to seven to twelve months ago? The responses are concentrated on the “raised” side. A meaningful portion of the sample reports increases in the mid-single digits and above, with a large block indicating raised by 3% to 5% as the most common outcome, followed by raised by 6% to 10% and additional cohorts seeing even larger jumps. At the high end, roughly 25% of respondents say prices rose 6% to 20% or more, which is a significant inflation indicator for hardware buyers. Now anchor that with the time series on the right. The average change in hardware pricing bottomed in late 2024 at roughly 2% to 2.5%. Since then, the average has risen by about a full percentage point, reaching 3.6% in the latest survey. The implication is that hardware price inflation is not fading as a temporary post-pandemic trend. It is re-accelerating at a time when many organizations would normally be entering a refresh cycle. We believe the supply-demand imbalance drives the continued trend, driven by AI factory demand. Vendors benefit from the current dynamic and have little incentive to rush pricing back down. Data center demand is being prioritized, and memory constraints ripple into everything from servers to storage to enterprise infrastructure to PCs. In our view, that is why terms like “AI-optimized” become mainstream marketing language, especially in PCs – memory becomes the gating factor, and vendors position optimization as product differentiation while supply remains constrained. We also believe this has second-order effects across the enterprise stack. Hardware refresh cycles influence demand for adjacent categories that ride on those refreshes, including security appliances and networking infrastructure. As pricing pressure persists, refresh timing and configuration decisions will become more constrained, with related impacts for vendors across the infrastructure and security landscape. Finally, we expect supply chain execution to be a competitive differentiator. Nvidia is likely to remain prioritized in the data center supply chain. On the PC side, it becomes a knife fight where scale and supply chain strength matter. Apple has scale. Dell is moving aggressively into consumer PCs and has a world-class supply chain. Storage vendors are already leaning into efficiency messaging, (for example, Vast Data Inc.’s flash efficiency messaging) and we expect more of that as the market stays constrained. The message is that the hardware market is entering a prolonged period where memory-driven constraints keep prices higher for longer, supply chain access becomes a competitive weapon, and buyers face a more expensive refresh cycle that reverberates across infrastructure categories well into 2027. We believe 2026 is the crossover year when AI’s impact on white-collar employment becomes visible in a way that is measurable and broadly acknowledged. The early impact is already seen in junior and entry-level roles, and this shows up in the data, first as headcount avoidance and then scaling without labor. In parallel, we expect sustained growth in blue-collar roles tied to the data center buildout – specialized trades and technical operators such as “artisan” plumbers, HVAC engineers, builders and cooling experts – where demand is already high and rising. The ETR survey data is already moving in the direction of this prediction. In July 2025, 21% of respondents said they were limiting future headcount due to AI. That figure has increased to 30% in the latest read. This trend is more pronounced in larger firms, which we see as the leading indicator. Among Global 2000 organizations, the number rises to 34%. Among Fortune 100 companies, 42% say they plan to limit future headcount because of AI. The message is that the larger the organization, the more aggressive the posture on future headcount constraints tied directly to AI. We are also seeing movement from avoidance to reduction. Strategic headcount reduction attributed to AI is rising more slowly than avoidance, but the increase from 14% to 18% in roughly half a year is material. These are not marginal shifts, and they are not based on a small or anecdotal sample. The survey represents roughly 1,800 qualified IT experts and IT decision-makers across industries, which makes the directional signal difficult to dismiss. We believe this sits inside a larger pattern that plays out in major technology transitions. Over successive waves – mainframes to PCs, then the internet, cloud, mobile, social and big data – markets tend to reward the new before the new is large enough to offset the decline in the old. That mismatch creates volatility and shifting narratives. We see it today in sector rotation and sentiment – semiconductors in favor, SaaS out of favor – and we expect those narratives to continue shifting. The sensible approach is to focus on the data, filter out headline noise and track the adoption signals that show up in spending behavior and operating model changes. In our opinion, AI is larger than prior waves because it stands on the shoulders of them all. It changes the unit economics of work, and that shows up first in constrained hiring and then in reductions as organizations learn where automation is durable. Over time, we expect labor demand to rebalance, with new job creation tied to physical infrastructure and AI-enabled industries, but 2026 is positioned to be the year where the labor displacement data becomes hard to ignore. The message is that 2026 becomes the year AI’s labor impact is visible in enterprise headcount decisions at scale, led by hiring constraints in the largest organizations and followed by rising reductions, while demand for specialized blue-collar roles expands alongside the data center buildout and the broader AI infrastructure wave. We’re beyond the first inning of this AI era, which started really in 2017 with research papers on diffusion models and transformers. The ChatGPT moment exposed AI’s potential to the masses and now we’re entering the enterprise adoption phase, which we see as the real opportunity. How you see 2026 shaping up?

Title: Brex and The Pros and Cons of Hubristic Fundraising

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Fundraising Capital One just announced it’s acquiring Brex for $5.15 billion. An incredible, top 0.1% “exit” in less than 10 years from a category creator that created massive wealth and opportunities. A huge win. But also … less than half of Brex’s $12.3 billion valuation from October 2022. Should anyone care? Many are seeing is a failure vs Ramp, a measured success at best. But … why? I don’t think most people commenting on this actually understand what they’re reacting to. What they’re really feeling—even if they can’t articulate it—is the consequences of hubristic fundraising. And we should probably talk about it. Because hubristic fundraising is back. In a big way. It was back big time in 2025 and is back even bigger time in 2026. Let me define it simply: Hubristic fundraising is when you raise at a valuation so aggressive, with terms so favorable, with a narrative so bold, that you are essentially betting the entire future of your company on hitting an extraordinary outcome. It’s not just “raising a lot of money.” Plenty of companies raise hundreds of millions without hubris. Hubristic fundraising is when you: These deals can work out. It will work out for Databricks, Anthropic, etc. But at least as of when I write this, there are so very few $30B+ IPOs or exits. And that’s what Brex was promising. ElevenLabs, Harvey, Replit/Lovable, Cursor etc. are promising even more. Brex checked all these boxes. In 2021 and 2022, they raised at valuations that implied they would not just win corporate cards and expense management—they would dominate financial services for startups, then enterprises, then… everyone, apparently. Stupidest behavior I've seen on @brexHQ getting acquired by @CapitalOne for $5.15B: – Saying Brex "lost"– Mocking Brex for the outcome– Claiming investors lost money If losing means starting a business that gets sold for over $5B in 9 years, where both founders make hundreds… — JC Bahr-de Stefano (@jbahrdestefano) January 23, 2026 Let’s remember what 2021 looked like. Zero interest rates. SPACs everywhere. Tiger Global doing deals in 48 hours. Multiples that would make a 1999 VC blush. Brex raised $300 million at a $12.3 billion valuation in October 2022—technically 2022, but really the tail end of the 2021 madness before rates spiked and everything crashed. At that valuation, with maybe $200-250M in revenue at the time, Brex was being valued at 50x+ revenue. For a low gross margin corporate card and expense management company. In a market with Ramp, Mercury, Airbase, Navan, and others all competing furiously. Was that valuation justified by fundamentals? No. Was it justified by the fundraising environment and competitive dynamics of the moment? Absolutely. And that’s the trap of hubristic fundraising. In the moment, it feels not just rational but necessary. Hubristic fundraising works. At least for a while. And sometimes forever. When you’re the $12 billion company and your competitor is the $3 billion company, who do the Stanford MBAs and Google PMs want to join? The big number wins. The paper gains look better. The press coverage is better. The LinkedIn flex is better. Brex recruited absolute killers in 2021-2022. Engineers from Stripe. Execs from everywhere. One of the best sales teams ever under Sam Blond. That was partly product and vision—but it was also the massive valuation signaling “this is the winner.” This one is circular but real. Raise at a huge valuation, and suddenly more investors want in. FOMO is the most powerful force in venture capital. The $12.3B valuation wasn’t a barrier to raising more—it was a magnet for investors who wanted to be part of “the next big thing.” Enterprise customers want to work with winners. When Brex was valued at $12B and their competitor was valued at $2B, which one do more conservative customers feel comfortable signing a multi-year deal with? The big number creates legitimacy. It signals staying power. Every funding round becomes news. Every executive hire becomes news. You’re always in the conversation. That awareness compounds. When you’re raising at $12B and your competitor just raised at $1.5B, you are sending a message: we are going to outspend you on everything. Sales. Marketing. R&D. Acquisitions. Some competitors will give up. Others will make mistakes trying to keep up. Ramp didn’t give up. But many others did. Now for the dark side. This is the big one. And it’s what I think people are actually reacting to with Brex without realizing it. When you raise at a hubristic valuation, you attract employees, investors, and partners who are there for the outcome, not the mission. They’re there because they did the math on their equity and saw an IPO at $25B+ and early retirement. That’s fine when everything is going up and to the right. But the moment you hit turbulence—and every company hits turbulence—those mercenaries disappear. They have no patience for struggle. They didn’t sign up for hard mode. They signed up for paper gains. Brex went through brutal layoffs in 2024. Lost 20% of the company. Massive executive turnover. Struggled with burn. Had to do a full “Brex 3.0” turnaround that CEO Pedro Franceschi admirably pulled off. But where were the fans during that turnaround? Where were all the people celebrating Brex’s dominance in 2021? Gone. Because they were never fans. They were mercenaries betting on an outcome, not a company. Brex just sold for $5.15 billion. In cash and stock. To a major bank. Creating liquidity for everyone. Is that a failure? We’re already seeing this play out in real-time in AI. Look at Windsurf. Windsurf (formerly Codeium) was one of the hottest AI coding startups. They had $82 million in ARR with enterprise revenue doubling quarterly. OpenAI offered $3 billion to acquire them. When that deal fell apart, Google paid $2.4 billion in a reverse acqui-hire for the CEO, co-founder, and 40 senior staff. Cognition then scooped up the remaining assets—the product, IP, 210 employees, and the entire $82M ARR business—for a reported $250 million. Total value captured: roughly $2.65 billion. And yet? The narrative in Silicon Valley was that Windsurf “sold too cheap.” SaaStr literally published “Did Windsurf Sell Too Cheap?” The deal was framed as a cautionary tale, a fire sale, a disappointment. Think about that. A company with $82 million ARR that didn’t exist three years ago returned $2.65 billion to stakeholders. In any other era, that’s a legendary outcome. But when Cursor is valued at $29.3 billion? When Lovable hits $6.6 billion with $200 million ARR? Suddenly $2.65 billion for $82 million ARR feels like leaving money on the table. That’s hubristic fundraising distorting reality. The benchmarks have become so warped that even massive wins feel like losses. For Ribbit Capital, who led the Series A, this is a monster return. For employees who joined early, this is life-changing money. For the customers using the product, nothing changes except they get the backing of a major financial institution. But because the peak valuation was $12.3B, the narrative is “Brex failed.” They got acquired at a “steep discount.” They “crashed.” This is insane. A $5B+ exit is an incredible outcome for any company. But hubristic fundraising creates hubristic expectations. And anything short of those expectations feels like failure—even when it objectively isn’t. When you’ve raised at $12B, you can’t think about $5B exits. You can’t consider acqui-hires or smaller strategic deals. Every decision has to be oriented around justifying that massive valuation. This leads to over-expansion, over-hiring, and over-spending. Brex’s $17 million/month burn in Q4 2023 was a direct consequence of trying to grow into a $12B valuation. For Brex to have “succeeded” by the mercenary definition, they probably needed to IPO at $20B+ or get acquired for $15B+. In the fintech market of 2023-2025. With rising rates. With competitors like Ramp breathing down their neck. That’s an almost impossible bar. And when you don’t clear it, everyone who joined for the outcome—and only the outcome—writes you off. Here’s the thing that should concern everyone: we’re doing this again. And in the Age of AI, we’re doing it at a scale that makes 2021 look quaint. Look at Ramp. In 2025 alone, they went from $13B to $16B to $22.5B to $32B. Four funding rounds in one year. Nearly tripling their valuation in twelve months. Is Ramp a great company? Of course. They hit $1B+ in ARR in record time. They’re cash flow positive. They’ve executed brilliantly. But four rounds in one year? A $32B valuation for an expense management company? This is 2021 fundraising playbook all over again. Except now, in AI, it’s 2021 on steroids. Let me share some numbers that should make your head spin. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion in a seed round. Not Series A. Not Series B. A seed round. At a $12 billion valuation. Before shipping a product. The former OpenAI CTO walks out the door and six months later has a company valued higher than Brex just sold for. And it gets crazier. Bloomberg reported Thinking Machines is now in discussions to raise additional funding at a $50 billion valuation. Even with their CTO having just quit with several other top team members to go back to OpenAI. That would be a 4x markup in less than a year. For a company that just launched its first product in October. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised over $1 billion for his AI safety startup. The former OpenAI Chief Scientist hasn’t shipped anything public yet. But billions? Sure, here you go. Harvey, the legal AI company, went from $3B to $5B to $8B across three funding rounds in 2025 alone. They raised $760 million in a single year. They 2.7x’d their valuation in ten months. For an AI tool that helps lawyers do due diligence faster. ElevenLabs went from $1.1B (January 2024) to $3.3B (January 2025) to $6.6B (September 2025). That’s 6x in less than two years. A voice synthesis company is now worth more than Brex sold for. Lovable, the Swedish “vibe coding” startup, went from $1.8B in July to $6.6B in December. They 3.5x’d in five months. They’re barely a year old. Cursor went from under $10B to $29.3B in a single year. They raised $2.3B in their Series D. That’s not a funding round—that’s an entire unicorn in a single check. We are now regularly seeing what would have been considered absurd even in 2021: billion-dollar seed rounds, valuations that exceed Brex’s exit for companies that haven’t shipped products, and 3-4x markups in less than a year. Is this driven by real innovation? In many cases, yes. AI is genuinely transformative. Is this also hubristic? Also yes. The same dynamics apply, just amplified. These valuations require these companies to not just succeed but to dominate. They require AI to transform every industry exactly as promised, on exactly the timeline investors are betting on. They require no major regulatory setbacks, no compute shortages, no technical plateaus. And they’re attracting the same mercenaries—talent, capital, and partners who are there for the paper gains, not the mission. Some of these companies will hit their numbers and the valuations will prove justified. ElevenLabs has real revenue. Harvey has real customers. Cursor has $1B ARR. The AI revolution is real. But many won’t hit their numbers. And when they don’t—when the inevitable correction comes—we’ll see the same pattern: mercenaries leaving, narratives turning, “failures” that are actually $3-5B exits, founders blamed for outcomes that were structurally locked in the moment they took hubristic valuations. The difference this time? The numbers are bigger. The falls will be harder. And the schadenfreude will be even more intense. When Thinking Machines is worth $50B and comes up short of expectations, no one will remember that Mira Murati built something real. They’ll call it a failure because it wasn’t worth $100B. When Harvey can’t grow into an $8B valuation fast enough, no one will remember they serve half of the top law firms in America. They’ll say legal AI was overhyped. That’s how hubristic fundraising works. The mercenaries don’t remember the mission. They only remember the paper. For many founders, especially in AI, hubristic fundraising isn’t really a choice. It’s a survival imperative at the very top. The war for AI talent is unlike anything we’ve seen before. Meta is offering $1 billion+ packages to poach researchers. OpenAI is clawing back co-founders from startups that raised $2 billion seed rounds. Google paid $2.4 billion just to acqui-hire 40 people from Windsurf. If you’re an AI founder and you don’t raise at an aggressive valuation, what happens? Your competitor raises at $10B. They can now offer engineers equity packages worth $50M on paper. Your $2B valuation offers $10M packages. You lose the talent war before it starts. Your competitor has $500M in the bank to buy GPUs. You have $50M. You can’t train competitive models. You fall behind on capabilities. Your competitor’s valuation signals “winner” to enterprise customers. Your valuation signals “risky bet.” You lose deals to perception, not product. In many cases, it might be almost irresponsible not to take the hubristic path. The founders who stayed disciplined, who raised at “reasonable” valuations, who prioritized sustainable growth—many of them got steamrolled by competitors who didn’t. So I’m not here to tell founders to avoid hubristic fundraising. In the current AI environment, that might be asking them to bring a knife to a gunfight. Hubristic fundraising narrows your exit options. Not always financially—Brex proved you can still do a “down exit” and create real liquidity. But it narrows what success means for your stakeholders, your employees, your company narrative, and frankly, for your own psychology. When you raise at $12B, a $5B exit isn’t a win. It’s a disappointment. When you raise at $29B, anything less than a $50B+ IPO feels like failure. When your employees joined expecting a $100B outcome, a $10B exit means they’re doing mental math on what could have been. The mercenaries don’t just leave when things go badly. They leave when things go less well than the paper said they would. You can raise hubristically and still build a great company. Brex did. But you need to go in with eyes open about who you’re attracting, what expectations you’re setting, and how the narrative will be written if you come up even a little short. Because the siren call is seductive. The capital, the talent, the press, the gravity—it all feels like winning. And sometimes it is winning. But sometimes it’s just setting yourself up for a “failure” that would have been a triumph at any other valuation. Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras built something real. They went from Stanford dropouts to a $5B+ exit in under 8 years. They served thousands of companies, moved billions of dollars, and built technology that Capital One clearly values. The “failure” narrative says more about our broken expectations than about Brex. But there is a lesson here for founders considering hubristic fundraising—especially the AI founders raising at $10B, $20B, $50B valuations right now: Know who you’re attracting. The capital, talent, and attention that comes with a huge valuation comes with strings attached. Those strings are expectations. And when expectations get too disconnected from reality, you’ll eventually find yourself surrounded by people who were only ever there for the paper. Missionaries stay through the turnaround. Mercenaries don’t. Brex survived their turnaround and found a soft landing. Many companies in the next few years won’t be so fortunate. The question for every founder raising in this frothy AI market—whether you’re building fintech or AI B2B or foundation models—is simple: are you building a company or a casino bet? Are you really, honestly building a $100B generational company? And who exactly is sitting at your table? Because when the cards turn—and they always turn—you’ll find out fast who was really on your team. Just ask Brex. They built a real company, executed a real turnaround, and achieved a real exit. And half the internet is calling it a failure because the number wasn’t big enough. That’s the price of hubristic fundraising. Powerful? Yes. Dangerous? Also yes. Choose your investors, your employees, and your expectations wisely. The mercenaries won’t be there when you need them most.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike. I went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon. That's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff. I was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a "great résumé."

Little did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit. In the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it. At first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked. Instead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called "The Reboot Era," where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences. Even with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, "Should I update my résumé for this role?" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls. LinkedIn "Easy Apply" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked. At first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house. A week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me. Over the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters. With AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast. In total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer. That's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase. AI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person. I think the job market is going in the wrong direction. First, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand. If the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions. None of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back. Jump to

Only select stores though OP might need that in title. 1 out of 6 stores around me has it and that doesn't allow pick up so no deal for me Rooster Rolls are absolutely top tier fast food. Real chicken, not tenders. Two of them would hit the spot All I buy there, ..Just wish they didn't microwave the f out of em. I'm a 8 beers and 0.25 vodka atm and the rooster roll is one of gods greatest creations Haha, had just ordered 4 rooster rolls, 2 for dinner, and 2 for lunch at work tomorrow. Truly the best. After i placed the first order, i was unable to get the same deal again? How were you able to place 2 orders for the same deal? I really like the pineapple fritters and colesaw also This comes and goes often, but gosh it’s terrible food. Soggy rolls with some blender chicken. The two posts above literally could not be any different if they tried. My personal opinion red rooster has better quality than the beef burger fast food joints trying their hands on chicken as well as better quality than kfc 100%. KFC at it's best is superb, but I don't find them consistent. Red Rooster is just such a great consistent option in my humble opinion $9 delivery is a killer Free with uber one because it's technically over the $20 threshold. But they still get you for like a 1.20 service fee Most of the Red Rooster outlets I see are empty, or hardly anyone is inside. Wonder how they make a profit or how they survive. My local dosen't even have tables for eat in- just counter seating. Most of their business is from drive through. Instead of disparaging the great rooter, instead support them Anyone found a store that allows pickup? Yeah there should be many wasnt able to use the offer for pick up orders though There’s no rooster roll in the menu, wtf? A red rooster store delisted the rolls AFTER I took advantage of this LOL. Every time I click the banner the rolls are missing from the menu. I've now switched to another red rooster store and the rolls now show up… So funny when Uber does deals for stores and the stores refuse to play ball. Ordered Rooster Rolls from my local store today for lunch. Unfortunately, I found that the amount of chicken provided was roughly a quarter of what is standard or advertised. It was essentially a bread roll with very little filling, which made for a very poor experience and poor value for money. Very disappointed. Don't know if anyone else had the same experience. definitely tell them. a rooster roll should be filled up properly All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

Title: After A Snake-Like 2025, Is The Bitcoin Price Ready to Break Out In 2026?

The bitcoin price twisted and turned through a tough 2025 — but historical cycles, investor sentiment, and market signals suggest a stronger 2026 may be ahead. We had high hopes for the bitcoin price in 2025. It was supposed to be the crescendo of the four-year cycle, the most bullish setup in recent memory. It was the year after the halving, the ETFs had just been approved, a new president was elected, with the promise of the money printer roaring back to life. Everything looked primed for a Q4 blow-off top, and instead of a new life in Monaco, all you got was this lousy article. What follows is my interpretation of the events of 2025 and my outlook for 2026. I’m not a trader, not an analyst, and like you, I’ve been outperforming professional funds for years, by simply stacking Sats, of course. I’m more of a “fix the money, fix the world” kinda guy, but like everyone else, it’s hard to ignore Bitcoin’s price movements, which I think of as the game of “Snakes and Ladders”. In the game of Snakes and Ladders, momentum drives us forward, but it can also provide a false sense of confidence. You can be one roll away from victory, only to land on a snake that sends you sliding back ten places. As much as hopium dictates that we pray for the price to go ‘up and to the right’, markets rarely oblige. Switching from the board to the chart, price action is played on a board of global liquidity and market sentiment. When sentiment is low or liquidity dries up, no amount of good news can sustain momentum. We simply crab sideways or find a snake that slides us down into further despair. On the other hand, when liquidity floods the system, we often find the ladders that shoot us through resistance levels. For most of 2025, we were stuck playing the former, while dreaming of the “ladder”. So let’s take this time to review 2025 from the perspective of hindsight, as foresight proved to be of little benefit. If there is a phrase that defines the Bitcoin market of 2025, it is exactly that: a Year of Snakes and precious few ladders. Interestingly, and unbeknownst to me, 2025 was indeed the year of the snake according to the 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle, starting January 29, 2025, and ending February 16, 2026. We began the year with the kind of euphoria that usually marks a cycle top. The halving was behind us, and the political stars had aligned perfectly. Google trends showed search queries were soaring. In fact, the year kicked off with a quiet but massive victory before the political fireworks even started: FASB fair value accounting rules took effect on January 1st, finally allowing companies to report bitcoin profits rather than just losses. Then came the main event. We witnessed the inauguration of a “Bitcoin President.” Gary Gensler departed, leaving behind a legacy that, in hindsight, was perhaps less villainous than we assumed, and Ross Ulbricht walked free within 48 hours. With the new administration came a few allies: Paul Atkins took over the SEC and Mike Selig the CFTC, securing a pro-crypto cabinet. The financial plumbing was finally completed. The ETFs were fully operational, options trading on IBIT were unleashed, and it quickly became clear that Michael Saylor was not about to let Larry Fink steal his thunder. MicroStrategy went on a $25 billion buying spree, 100x what they bought in 2020, and the corporate treasury list exploded from 60 companies to nearly 200. By October, the engines were well and truly revving. We hit the All-Time High on October 6th, ready to punch the accelerator for the glorious Q4 end-of-cycle run. Instead, we shifted the gear into reverse and slid all the way down to $80,000. First, we got our knickers in a twist over the “Knots vs. Core” drama. Then came the Binance incident, where the snake manifested itself as a “technical issue” at precisely the wrong time, and right as Gold broke out. We essentially got rug-pulled by a glitch. The issue of October 10th likely created added sell pressure through forced liquidations, whilst also triggering the 4-year cycle sellers who have been trained to sell Q4 of the 4th year. Few understood the gravity of it at the time, though I tip my hat to Jesse Olson for calling it early. Then the FUD machine was turned on. First, it targeted MicroStrategy with threats of MSCI exclusion; it didn’t help sentiment that its mNAV has been dropping all year. Then it pivoted back to Bitcoin with the return of the “quantum attack” narrative. While the headlines swirled, the bitcoin price became stuck in purgatory, range-bound between $84,000 and $95,000 and trapped by options traders, even though the handcuffs had theoretically been taken off IBIT options earlier in the year. Bitcoin was having an Austin Powers moment, while Peter Schiff enjoyed his first day out in the sun since high school. Bless him. While some fear 2026 will bring the hangover of a post-cycle bear market, I, like countless other optimists believe otherwise. If 2025 was the year of snakes, 2026 is the year we finally climb a few ladders. The setup is favourable. We have a Bitcoin-ish president, who’s hungry to fire up the printing press, we’ve a developing multipolar world, where the process of game theory should be heating up, there’s a $7 trillion debt wall to be paid, the old guard are positioned, the regulation stranglehold has been loosened, the cowboys (FTX, Terra-Luna, etc.) are gone, gold and silver have both had their runs, and Bitcoin’s supposed to follow next, or so we hope. Not to mention, the tax year is done, and new budgets have been allocated to fund managers and businesses alike. FASB fair value accounting is now live, smoothing the runway for corporate balance sheets. Michael Saylor is still buying with the relentless intensity of a man who understands math better than Archimedes. Even the “MSCI FUD” was defeated early, so credit to George and the Bitcoin for Corporations team for that victory. At the point in time as the price is beginning to climb higher, the bears are finally showing signs of exhaustion, that’s according to James Check and countless others. By far the most significant headwind Bitcoin faced in 2025 was the relentless onslaught of coins sold by long-term holders. That pressure looks to finally be ending. On November 1st, approximately 67% of the Realised Cap was invested above $95k. The last two months have seen a massive supply redistribution occur, with that metric declining to 47%. Over the last 30 days, around 80% of the coins which have transacted came from higher prices. This is the definition of capitulation. The weak hands who bought the top have flushed out, and new buyers have stepped in with a lower and stronger cost basis. Incidentally, the Year of the Snake officially ends on February 16, 2026, to be followed by a horse, which as we all know has the ability to outrun any bull. This coincides almost perfectly with the monthly CME Futures expiry on February 27th. The shedding of a snake’s skin happens right before the growth returns. Really, who can truly say they know? What we do know is that the four-year cycle is no longer connected to the halvings or the presidential cycles in the way we once thought, and the halvings are less likely to have an effect going forward, as the new coins distributed are a lower percentage of supply, and the miners are supported by huge funds which can help them weather any potential death spiral.We have not seen a Pi Cycle top signal, the 200 week moving average has not crossed the prior cycle top, the MVRV score is just 1.3, the Puell multiple is just .99, we’ve not had a considerable drawdown, and we’re still at the bottom of the range of almost every metric imaginable. For those of you who are old enough to remember the KitKat ad from the 90’s, “the 4 year cycle is not dead, it was just takin’ a break.” As the 4-year cycle is a purely Liquidity Based Cycle, it can be measured by proxy using the ISM Manufacturing PMI, a qualitative index sourced from purchasing managers in the manufacturing industry. I give credit to Raoul Pal for highlighting this metric; he was the first I observed to point out that bitcoin is a “Liquidity” asset rather than a “Halving” asset. Bitcoin, as the highest-beta risk asset in existence, responds to shifts in global risk appetite with greater force and speed than any other asset class. The PMI tracks the business cycle, and it has been in contraction for nearly two years. The current PMI at 47.9 signals ongoing contraction, but ISM projections indicate a 4.4% revenue growth for manufacturing in 2026, crossing 50 in Q2 as Trump’s policies kick in. The bitcoin price should follow. When the ISM PMI is below 50, we’re generally in a bear market, and we’ve been that way for over two years now. The bull markets have historically topped out between 55 and 65. The question remains, when is the business cycle going to see an upturn? TechDev is of the view that it’s happening very soon, as the bullish divergence reversal momentum is decidedly building. The $9 Trillion Debt Question The US government has to address the $9 trillion debt wall that’s due to mature this year. But the nuance is in how they do it. President Trump has made it clear he intends to build a “Dream Military” for 2027 and is pushing for a budget increase to $1.5 trillion. When you combine that with the $4.1 trillion of debt maturing in 2026 and the standard annual deficit, the US Treasury faces a $9 trillion liquidity gap, and a further $7.4 trillion before 2028. Does the US have to print all $9 trillion? No. And through this lens, the recent geopolitical moves make sense. Trump didn’t only capture Maduro for a photo-op; he has likely taken control over 303B barrels of reserves and is enforcing USD oil sales, creating artificial dollar demand and easing the liquidity gap by $2-3T annually. Can he cover the gap via a mix of tariffs (that Americans actually pay for!), Petro-Dollar demand, and the inevitable monetization of the rest by the Federal Reserve? I guess he’ll have to. With Jerome Powell expected to leave his chair in May, the path will be cleared to give the printer engines a whir. There’s another $5 – $10 tr due globally in 2026, and the same again in 2027. So the fed chair won’t be without company. The four-year cycle OGs may be stepping aside, but the Liquidity Cycle is just gearing up, and Bitcoin, as Raoul Pal has long argued, remains the ultimate liquidity barometer. Samuel Benner’s famous 19th-century forecasting chart (first published in 1875), maps long-term cycles of panics (“A” years), booms/high prices (“B” years), and depressions/low prices (“C” years). Interestingly, 2026 falls squarely in one of Benner’s “B” years, which is a period of “Good Times, High Prices and the time to sell Stocks and values of all kinds.” The chart places 2026 right alongside previous boom years like 2016, 2007, 1999, and 1989, suggesting we are entering a structurally favorable window for risk assets. How Long Will The Next Money Printing Last? Prediction: 18–24 months Why: History shows that once the dam gates open, it takes roughly two years to stabilize and reflate. If the official aggressive printing phase begins in late 2025 (as the liquidity uptick and Benner timeline imply, and as M2 shows), it will likely run strong through mid-2027. Prediction: ~$9–$10 trillion in the U.S. Treasury debt is maturing in 2026 alone (about one-third of outstanding marketable debt) and a further $5 – $10 tr globally. Why: As discussed above, the maturity walls for 2026 are nearly double what we faced during the COVID crisis. Yellen extended the pain by leaning on short-term issuance back then, but come hell or high water, that debt has to be paid or refinanced—the money will arrive from somewhere. Because of this, we can expect a new wave of inflation, the 70’s and 80’s have a story to tell about that! Prediction: $250,000 Why: During that $5 trillion COVID expansion, BTC rallied roughly 20x from the $3k–$4k lows to $69k. With the potential for double that liquidity entering the system this cycle, the upside is significant even if diminishing returns apply. From our $16k effective low, a conservative 10x to 12x multiple lands us in the $160k to $200k range as a base case. However, models suggest we could push higher. PlanC’s quantile model points toward $300k+ by the end of 2026, and Giovanni Santostasi’s Power Law projects a peak potentially around $210k early on, with room to stretch as high as $600k in outlier scenarios. But hey, I was expecting +$200k last cycle too. Oh, if the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act moves out of the committee, and if the U.S. Treasury officially starts side-stacking alongside MicroStrategy, all bets are off the table. Prediction: Late 2026 to mid-2027 The Logic: Bitcoin historically tops out 12–18 months after the liquidity expansion enters its “mania” phase. If the ISM Manufacturing PMI crosses back above 50 in early 2026, the perfect storm should unfold throughout 2026, setting up a blow-off top, potentially in the first half of 2027. Bitcoin is unlikely to go straight up, nothing ever does. We’ll almost certainly encounter a few snakes along the way: sharp corrections, regulatory noise, profit-taking, or some form of shenanigans. But the ladders are built, ready and waiting. The Year of the Snake is coming to an end, just ahead of the February 27 CME futures expiry, our potential ignition point, right before the anticipated PMI uptick in Q2. 2025 was a year of snakes and sideways pain, with long-term holders finally capitulated and weak hands flushed out. Now, with a wall of liquidity heading our way, 2026 looks like the ladder we’ve been waiting for. The horse year is coming, so stack and secure accordingly. Good luck.
