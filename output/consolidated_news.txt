BlackRock is expanding its membership in the club of AI datacenter investors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another day, another blimp with billions flying the skies of AI. Today's currency transfer comes from BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an investment fund set to write a big check to buy out Aligned Data Centers, a large AI datacenter company. Bloomberg cites sources with knowledge of the deal and pins the amount at a tidy $40 billion. Aligned may not be a household name in tech news, but according to its website, the company has 78 datacenters in locations around the U.S. and South America, totaling 5 GW of processing power capacity across current and future developments. Bloomberg remarks that Aligned got a $12 billion investment in January and was one of the companies that recently met with President Trump about speeding up the country's AI development. Aligned is also attracting attention from investor AGX (backed by Mubadala Investment Co.), which apparently wants to cut a separate deal with the datacenter provider. The report remarks that the deal is set to be inked in a few days, but is not yet finalized. However, it's hard to imagine the agreement being called off in this age, where AI businesses' exponential growth has every investor under the sun tossing money at the prospect of massive short-term lucre. The $40 billion in play makes this deal one of the biggest this year, though it's still early October, and it wouldn't be surprising to see other large bets in short order. Upon completion of the deal, Aligned would be joining CyrusOne in GIP's AI datacenter portfolio. The fund's many-paged checkbook isn't going back in the drawer anytime soon, either; it's reportedly considering buying out power company AES Corp. If this news sounds familiar, it's because it's reminiscent of datacenter provider CoreWeave getting a $6.4 billion infusion from OpenAI just recently. As for Sam Altman's company, it's been cutting deals like crazy, the biggest ones a $300 billion contract with Oracle, and a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia for building 10 GW's worth of datacenters.

Title: State regulators approve sale of Allete

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ST. PAUL — Minnesota regulators signed off on the final approval needed to sell Allete to a pair of private investment firms. The five-member Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Friday voted unanimously to approve the sale of Minnesota Power’s Duluth-based parent company to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners. ADVERTISEMENT The $6.2 billion deal, announced in May 2024, drew concern over private equity’s ownership of a utility and the potential for rising electricity rates. “We are grateful to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for their thorough review and approval of this important and strategic partnership, and recognition that this is in the public interest,” Bethany Owen, chair, president and CEO of Allete, said in a news release following the decision. “Today’s decision caps a comprehensive public process and positions ALLETE well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Owen said. The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, a consumer advocacy group, several environmental groups and Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers were opposed to the sale, and an administrative law judge in July recommended, in a nonbinding opinion, that the PUC reject the deal as it wasn’t in the public interest. The role of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, came under particular scrutiny. Groups opposed to the deal feared Minnesota Power would favor deals that would benefit other BlackRock-owned companies at the expense of ratepayers. But Commissioner Hwikwom Ham disagreed, arguing that the fiduciary responsibility of CPP and BlackRock-owned GIP would prevent that and that the PUC itself could protect ratepayers from this in future rate cases. “The Commission’s confidence that they have the capacity, authority, and objectivity to regulate the likes of BlackRock — a financial behemoth that has tentacles in every part of the global economy — rings hollow, especially when they already oversee regular utility rate hikes that families struggle to afford,” said Maggie Schuppert, director of strategic intiatives for CURE, one of the environmental groups opposed to the deal. ADVERTISEMENT “It will fall on community and ratepayer advocates, utility watchdogs, and the public itself to hold these entities and the PUC to account and mitigate the harms of this decision,” Schuppert said. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, unions, a different consumer advocacy group and several clean energy groups supported the deal. Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of clean energy group Fresh Energy, said the group lent its support for the sale of Minnesota Power when it decided the deal “would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.” “We applaud the Commission for remaining focused on the substance of the issues at hand and what’s in the public interest of Minnesotans,” Gleckner said. Allete, which has long been publicly traded on the stock market, has maintained that going private under the ownership of GIP and CPP would allow it to more quickly and reliably access the money needed to fund its transition away from coal and carbon emissions and reach Minnesota’s law requiring 100% of the state’s electricity to be carbon-free by 2040. PUC Chair Katie Sieben said that while it “drove me nuts” to hear that the acquisition was needed to meet that law, she believed the PUC should approve the deal because investment was necessary to ensure reliability and affordability. “Whether Minnesota Power is publicly traded or privately held, it needs to comply with the laws of the state of Minnesota, including the state's 2040 carbon-free law. … Minnesota Power does need massive amounts of investment,” Sieben said. “That's not due to the state's carbon-free law necessarily, but also due to the fact that many of the utilities' assets are at end of age and need investment.” ADVERTISEMENT She added that support from commissioners came at different stages of the process, as parties involved in the proceedings reached agreements that got “it over the net benefit threshold of what would be in the public interest.” Throughout the nearly year and a half that the deal was in front of the PUC, and in particular the last few weeks, Allete, GIP and CPP have agreed to a series of commitments, including: Some PUC members said Friday that they had originally been skeptical about the deal, and Commissioner Joseph Sullivan said he had been opposed to the deal as recently as the Sept. 25 oral arguments but ultimately supported the sale Friday. “I still do have concerns in the out years … I’m concerned about what happens in the future, 10-15 years from now,” Sullivan said. “But I do think that the benefits in the near term and medium term clearly outweigh the status quo and clearly show that the partners, the parties, are taking very serious their commitment to the state.” He acknowledged the concerns residents of Northeastern Minnesota have about the deal and instructed Minnesota Power, GIP and CPP to build credibility with the public and customers. “If you don’t build that credibility,” Sullivan said, “that will redound unfavorably to everybody.” This story was updated at 2:40 p.m. Oct. 3 with details from Friday's meeting and reaction to the deal's approval. It was originally posted at 11:24 a.m. Oct. 3. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 1, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Title: Sam Altman on AI bubble: ‘People make some dumb capital allocations’ from time to time

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company’s valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don’t meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company’s AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that “over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

InternationalCommentary PoliticsNews SocietyNews Health CareCommentary PoliticsNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews LawNews SocietyNews InternationalNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews Commentary News PoliticsNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews International Commentary International News PoliticsCommentary Education Analysis SocietyCommentary PoliticsAnalysis Commentary Commentary Commentary Commentary SecurityNews FBI Director Kash Patel (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The FBI has confirmed that it severed all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left activist group that puts conservatives and Christians on a “hate map” along with Ku Klux Klan chapters. The “hate map” has inspired at least one terrorist attack against a conservative organization. “The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,” FBI Director Kash Patel told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “Their so-called hate map has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.” “That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,” Patel added. The FBI confirmed that it has no intelligence products from the SPLC and does not engage in contact or information sharing with the SPLC. The statement comes days after Patel told Fox News Digital that the FBI had severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that opposes antisemitism but also leans left and condemns critics of transgender ideology. While the SPLC began as a public interest law firm focused on civil rights cases, it gained its reputation by suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy and developed a decades-long relationship with law enforcement combating real hate. After the Klan largely disappeared, the SPLC started targeting mainstream conservative and Christian groups, putting them on a “hate map” alongside Klan chapters. In 2012, a domestic terrorist used the “hate map” to target the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C. He planned to kill everyone in the building. A building manager largely foiled the attack, but suffered lifelong injuries in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack, but kept the council on the “hate map” ever since. The man who opened fire at a Republican practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, nearly killing then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, had “liked” the SPLC on Facebook. The SPLC condemned that attack, as well. The SPLC added Turning Point USA to the “hate map” mere months before an assassin with a transgender boyfriend allegedly murdered Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The SPLC condemned the attack, but has not removed Turning Point USA from the “hate map.” A bureau official told The Daily Signal that the FBI was aware that the “hate map” included Turning Point USA before the shooting. Patel noted that he had previously criticized the SPLC at a panel on anti-Christian bias. “In April, during our Anti-Christian Bias Panel, I made it clear that the FBI will never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups—and certainly not from the SPLC,” the FBI director told The Daily Signal. “Under this FBI, all ties with the SPLC have officially been terminated.” At that April event, Patel slammed the FBI under President Joe Biden’s administration, particularly for the notorious memo in which the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office (working with other field offices) urged agents to develop sources inside traditionalist Catholic churches and to target “Radical Traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the SPLC. Critics have long accused the SPLC of being anti-Christian, and the group responded to these claims by noting that it does not put all Christian groups on the “hate map.” For years, the SPLC cited its decision not to put the organization Focus on the Family on the “hate map” as evidence it wasn’t anti-Christian. This year, it added Focus to the map. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledged that the Justice Department would not partner with groups like the SPLC. The Biden administration reversed that, however. The SPLC has tremendous impact inside and outside of law enforcement. Then-SPLC President Margaret Huang bragged in a 2021 donor meeting that “many agencies in the new Biden administration” reached out to “solicit our expertise” to “help shape the policies that the new administration is adopting to counter the domestic terrorism threat.” That wasn’t hyperbole. The Justice Department received a briefing from the SPLC shortly after it added Moms for Liberty to the “hate map” in June 2023. Big Tech companies like Amazon have used the “hate map” to screen recipients for its former AmazonSmile program, where customers could designate a portion of their purchases go to support certain charities and other nonprofits. Companies like Eventbrite, PayPal, and Hyatt Hotels have relied on the SPLC’s “hate” accusations to decide who they will allow to use their platforms and facilities. Donor networks worth billions have pledged to keep charitable funds from going to SPLC-labeled “hate groups.” The SPLC enjoys this impact despite multiple scandals. The center fired its co-founder and saw its president resign in a 2019 racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal. Amid that scandal, SPLC staff created a union that is part of a union organization that represents the radical anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace. And amid a round of layoffs last year, the SPLC Union accused the center of engaging in “union-busting.” Despite its penurious name, the SPLC has an endowment of more than $700 million, compensates its leaders handsomely, and possesses more than $30 million in offshore accounts, according to IRS filings. Finally, the SPLC has troubling ties to Antifa, the loosely-organized movement of far-left agitators that President Donald Trump recently declared a domestic terrorist group.

Rainx Drive is the Best Cloud Storage Platform Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Lenovo LOQ 15 Gen10 review

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model. PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You know what my biggest bugbear is for budget laptops? It's the screen. It is always the screen. For some reason, notebook manufacturers seem to have this almost obsession with pairing massively underwhelming graphics cards with panels that would put most 4K TVs to shame. It's madness. Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years. That might sound ridiculous, I'll admit that, but I've reviewed a lot of budget laptops in my time that do this, and it's frustrating because it doesn't need to be the case. You gain very little by doing that. Thank the dear and fluffy lord Gabe Newell then (he doesn't have anything to do with this, I don't think, I haven't checked), that Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 ditches that seemingly age-old laptop manufacturer mantra in favor of a more practical GPU and screen pairing instead. At its core, the Gen10 comes complete with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, a Ryzen 7 250, and, more importantly than that, a simple, elegant, beautifully crisp and punchy 15.6-inch, 1920x1080 IPS display, running at around 144 Hz. And it does all of that with a sub $1400 price point. Now, yes, I know what you're thinking, technically, no, that graphics card isn't really a "true" RTX 5060. I mean, it sort of is, so far as the name's the same and the core RTX Blackwell architecture matches it as well, but it's lost about 15% of its CUDA cores, and a not-so-subtle 12% of everything else, (ray tracing cores, ROPs, TMUs, Tensor cores, you know, all the good stuff that makes DLSS 4, kinda, work). Heck, I suppose we should be thankful it still touts that same 8 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Model No: 15AHP10CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 250GPU: Nvidia RTX 5060 115WRAM: 16 GB DDR5-5600Storage: 512 GB PCIe 4.0 SSDScreen Size: 15.6-inch IPSRefresh Rate: 144 HzResolution: 1920 x 1080Battery: 60 WhrDimensions: 15.6 ~ 23.9 mm x 359.9 mm x 258.7 mm | 0.94 x 14.17 x 10.19 inchesWeight: 2.3 kg | 5.07 lbsPrice: $1,389 | £1,300 The good news, though, is that on the whole, that mobile RTX 5060 does actually deliver when it comes to 1080p gaming. Most titles easily averaged well into the 60 fps mark and above, the only exception, of course, being Cyberpunk 2077 without any DLSS support (which still achieved a relatively respectable 36 fps). Chuck on DLSS Quality and the beautiful silky goodness that is MFG, and that too climbs well into the 100s. It's so refreshing to be able to just game at your native resolution on a laptop at this price point, without having to worry about dialling the graphics preset down, or swapping around resolutions and getting stretched pixels or worse. Plus, that 15.6-inch screen is already delivering a pixel density greater than a 32-inch 4K panel does. Alrighty. Stop the press, cancel the review, clearly this is the best gaming laptop of 2025, right? Isn't that right, tiny human? Well, just hang on one minute. It's not all sun-lit uplands and frame rates. We need to talk about the storage and memory setup on this thing. Because, to be blunt. It sucks. In its default configuration, the one I'm testing here, the LOQ 15 comes with a single stick of 16 GB DDR5 at 5,600 MT/s. Do you know what Ryzen loves more than memory frequency? Memory bandwidth. There are times, particularly when loading programs, running multiple applications, or intense, high-load activities, when you almost feel this stuttering effect occur on the Gen10. There's a lag as you attempt to move an application across the screen or open up Task Manager. It's chilling to be blunt, giving Windows Vista vibes, and I don't like it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For an additional $65, Lenovo will pop an extra 16 GB stick in there for you, but to be honest, this should've been two 8GB dual-channel sticks to begin with, retaining that budget price point. At least so you're not left wondering if the whole system's locking up because you just opened Paint, or because your memory setup sucks. Again, on the SSD front, it's similarly just not good enough. The stock model is a SanDisk WD Blue SN5000S, QLC affair, not too dissimilar from the WD Blue SN5000 I reviewed late last year. That's fine, nothing particularly wrong with that for a budget unit. At least, that is, until you see the capacity. It's a 512 GB model, which once Windows is installed, sits at around 370 GB of total available space. I couldn't even install our entire benchmarking suite in one go; it was that small. I had to test games, then delete them and install other games and then test those… Again, Lenovo will happily pop in a 1 TB variant, but for an additional $60 added on to the price tag, which should've been included as standard, given it's a gaming laptop. My list of mild grievances continues with the battery life, which petered out at just 89 minutes. Although that is better than some of the more premium, more power-hungry units out there, the LOQ is generally hampered by its relatively small 60 WHr battery and AMD's relatively power-hungry Ryzen 7 250 CPU. Now, I've been harsh here, I have. This is a budget notebook, effectively. It can't all be brilliant at the end of it all, and there is still a lot to love about it, far beyond that of just the screen being the right pick for that graphics card. CPU performance is impressive, even with that single-channel memory, and it beats out other RTX 5060 notebooks like Gigabyte's Gaming A16 in average fps too, that one in particular featuring an Intel Core i7-13620H (a damning indictment of Intel's currently poor Ultra line gaming performance, it'd seem), which is nothing to sniff at. And the overall build quality of this thing? Purely outstanding. It is a gaming notebook; you can tell that from the get-go, there's no hiding that. There are angles and edges, embossed logos, and a jutting webcam divot, among other things, along with a whole host of I/O ports protruding out of its bottom. But it's not ostentatious. There's a suaveness to it, from the "luna grey" metallic satin finish to the heft and bulk of the thing. It feels solid, yet remains sleek, like it's designed for even the most aggro of esports streamers to wail on after they go 0-3 in competitive. I've played around with laptops four times the cost of this thing that pale in comparison when it comes to the build quality on show here, and that's not nothing. ✅ You don't mind the upgrade path: There's no denying it. The single-channel memory and 512 GB SSD on the base model are massively underwhelming. If you don't mind spending a little extra or can upgrade the two, then the Lenovo LOQ 15 is a fine choice for 1080p gaming. ❌ You're looking for something with a bit more flair: Aside from the above, the LOQ is very much a marmite style. You'll either love how subtle it is for a gaming notebook or despise it. If you're looking for something a little flashier, this ain't it. Cooling is impressive as well, and throughout my time testing, temps rarely got over 70 degrees, even under intense loads. Yes, fan noise is a thing, particularly when it's plugged in, but it's all manageable in Lenovo's Legion app, which, although relatively barebones, does a good enough job of managing noise in exchange for heat, which again you've got a good 20 degrees to play with. There are, of course, your state-mandated AI apps integrated in here as well, requiring Lenovo account sign-up and more, along with the usual intrusive McAfee anti-virus pre-install to be aware of, but from a software perspective, that's about it for bloatware. Elegant. Sophisticated. Well paired. Dialled in to a T. Yet flawed. That is what the LOQ 15 represents. With resplendent gaming performance and a sleek, sharp design that eschews the usual "gamer" nonsense in favor of sophisticated style instead, it's a laptop that checks a lot of boxes. Yet, it's not without fault, and although it entertains well enough, it could've been far, far better if only Lenovo had tweaked that entry-level model's configuration first. Still, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find an RTX 5060 notebook that packs as much punch as the LOQ 15 does into that price, and for that, I doth my hat to you fine Lenovo, you have done well. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strengthening its alliance with Fujitsu to co-develop full-stack artificial intelligence infrastructure, a move aimed at accelerating enterprise adoption of AI across industries from healthcare to manufacturing and robotics. The collaboration centers on building industry-specific AI agents that continuously learn and adapt, forming what both companies describe as the foundation for the next phase of the AI industrial revolution. The effort will integrate Fujitsu’s Monaka Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Nvidia’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) via NVLink Fusion, enabling more specialized systems than general-purpose architectures can provide. Also Read: Nvidia Becomes The $4.5 Trillion Giant Driving AI’s Biggest Deals “Fujitsu’s strategic collaboration with NVIDIA will accelerate AI-driven business transformation in enterprise and government sectors. By combining the cutting-edge technologies of both companies, we will develop and provide full-stack AI infrastructure, starting with sectors such as manufacturing where Japan is a global leader. To further support the expanding needs of AI infrastructure, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will expand this partnership in the areas of high-performance computing and quantum,” said Fujitsu CEO Takahito Tokita. “The AI industrial revolution has begun, and we must build the infrastructure to power it, in Japan and across the globe. Fujitsu is a true pioneer in computing and Japan’s trusted leader in supercomputing, quantum research, and enterprise systems. Together, NVIDIA and Fujitsu are connecting and extending our ecosystems to forge a powerful partnership for the era of AI,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang added. Fujitsu framed the collaboration against a backdrop of rising demand for generative AI, where high costs and technical hurdles have kept adoption largely confined to major corporations. The company said the partnership is designed to address those barriers by creating scalable infrastructure that balances performance, security, and enterprise autonomy. The deal comes as Nvidia continues to ride surging demand for its GPUs, which underpin most of the world’s cutting-edge AI systems. The company’s stock has surged 41% year-to-date, far outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index’s 19% gain. Earlier this week, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market capitalization, underscoring its central role in the AI boom.

Title: Spiritans adding to suffering of survivors of sex abuse in their schools, says advocacy group

Time Published: 2025-10-03T11:16:54Z
Full Content:
The Spiritan religious order has been accused of adding to the suffering of survivors abused in their schools through ongoing delays in announcing a redress scheme. The Restore Together group, which represents survivors of abuse in Blackrock College, Willow Park School, Rockwell College in Tipperary, along with St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, accused the order of a “lack of urgency” in the matter. By November last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. In a statement on Friday, Restore Together said the Spiritan order last June issued a public statement about making plans to commence a redress scheme for victims or survivors of abuse suffered at Spiritan schools. It said the order hoped to have an update by “the end of the summer”. The group said the Spiritans had not made any statement and since the end of the summer and it had been seeking a meeting with the Spiritans “to discuss urgently progressing the agreed restorative programme, but to no avail”. [ Spiritans’ promise of redress must be ‘substantiated by actions’, says abuse survivors groupOpens in new window ] This “lack of urgency is seen and felt as a further abuse of victims/survivors, one of control, by the order that abused them sexually decades ago”, the group said, adding that the Spiritans have had “more than enough time to properly address it”. In the meantime victims, survivors and their families “continue to suffer trauma daily”. This “ongoing lack of urgency” on the Spiritans’ part is “not acceptable to victims/survivors, their families and friends or Restore Together”. It called for the timely delivery of “the full programme the Spiritans have signed up” for. Otherwise, the groups said, its benefit “will be diluted, or even lost if people are made to wait too long and fight for every element of it”. [ Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victimsOpens in new window ] The group said it has been more than four years since Restore Together first engaged with the Spiritans on this, while it is “three years since we launched the Restorative Process Framework with them”. It noted that most victims and survivors are “60 or older and have carried this burden for decades”. Last June, in an open letter to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritan congregation, Provincial Fr Brendan Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. It was his “sincere hope”, Fr Carr said then, that by the end of the summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. In response to queries from The Irish Times, a spokesman for the Spiritans said they would “not be comment” on the latest Restore Together statement.

Title: BTC, Gold Jump as Shutdown Delays Data, Fuels Rate-Cut Bets: Crypto Daybook Americas

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$121,738.90 may be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge. With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. "October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception." said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. "Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response." Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Furloughed federal workers were already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, then came the government shutdown. Frustrated young Trump supporters express what they want to see out of the president. And, Taylor Swift album drops have always been an event; her 12th one was no different. Here's what to know today. Furloughed federal employees won't be paid until Congress passes legislation to fund the government. And with neither side showing signs of budging as the shutdown enters its third day, some federal employees say they are "sad," "scared" and "afraid." While most of the furloughed employees won't be allowed to work during the shutdown, others who are deemed essential — such as members of the military and airport security screeners — will continue working without pay. Federal workers typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but that requires congressional approval. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In addition to the uncertainty around paychecks, the Trump administration has threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to carry out more mass firings. That's left federal workers, already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, scrambling to figure out how to cope with the possibility of weeks without pay and a new round of layoffs, according to nearly two dozen federal workers who reached out to NBC News. The wife of a Department of Homeland Security worker in Ohio said that her bank rejected her request for a deferment on her mortgage. Like nearly all federal employees whom NBC News spoke with, she asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, which has publicly fired federal workers it has deemed as being against its agenda. "I was never afraid to speak my mind before, I never felt afraid to talk. Now, people are afraid," an Arizona TSA worker said, explaining her concerns over speaking publicly about how the shutdown is impacting her. She will have to continue working without pay during the shutdown. Read the full story. President Donald Trump's victory last year was fueled in part by young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed his campaign are beginning to sour on his administration's approach to immigration and the economy. Fourteen swing-state Trump voters under age 30 participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 "Deciders" series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago. Nine said they disapproved of Trump's overall job performance so far, while five approved. The group included eight self-identified independents and six Republicans. And while some of the voters in the focus groups detailed concerns about Trump, that didn’t necessarily mean they're inclined to support Democrats. Many of them described the Democratic Party as weak and out of touch. Read the full story. Sean "Diddy" Combs apologized and expressed how "sorry" he was "for all of the hurt and pain" he caused in a letter to the judge set to sentence him on two prostitution-related convictions today. Combs, who faces up to 20 years in prison, also asked for mercy, writing he has "been humbled and broken to my core." The letter marks the first time that Combs has addressed U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian in any meaningful way. During the eight-week federal trial, Combs did not testify and gave brief answers to questions from the judge. Read the full story. Taylor Swift has already broken records with her latest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," being the most pre-saved album ever on Spotify, making her the first female artist to exceed 100 million album sales. The album features a dozen tracks and reunited her with Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who produced her most recent albums. Fans are also expected to flock to movie theaters this weekend to catch "Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl," which the singer described as a "dazzling soirée." The theatrical event will include the premiere of the music video for "The Fate of Ophelia." Read the latest updates on "The Life of a Showgirl" in our liveblog. Perhaps, nobody knows more about how to sound like Trump than Ryan Chen, a social media star from "CHI-na." Though Chen has never set foot in the U.S., he sounds as American as the president himself, nailing Trump's tone, rambling cadence, and the signature hand gestures. In his first U.S. media interview, Chen told NBC News that he posted his first Trump impression video last fall just as a dare. But the clip went viral. So, he just kept going. Chen's popularity continues to grow at home and abroad even amid the U.S.-China trade war. However, Chen said his videos aren't about politics, and he just wants to make people laugh by introducing Chinese food and culture to foreigners in Trump's accent. – Peter Guo, associate producer Still unsure what's actually worth buying during Prime Big Deal Days?

Early flows are reported around 180-190,000 bpd, well below pipeline nameplate but significant enough to hit crude benchmarks. Turkey, long resistant over the ICC arbitration ruling that saddled it with $1.5 billion in damages, signed off once it secured leverage of its own: proposals to build four refineries in northern Iraq and carve out a role beyond transit. Ankara also benefits from restored fees and influence as a corridor state, while quietly betting that U.S. pressure to ease global supply tightness will insulate it from the legal overhang. The real drivers of the breakthrough were Baghdad’s fiscal need for revenues, Erbil’s economic desperation, and Washington’s insistence on de-bottlenecking northern exports. For now, the flows are real but not at capacity, the companies are only partially back on board, and the framework is fragile. Each 30-day renewal cycle will become a bargaining round, with arrears, revenue-sharing, and arbitration liabilities still hanging over the corridor. DNO and Genel have not fully re-entered the new Baghdad–Erbil export framework, leaving Kurdistan’s flows below potential. Both firms continue producing but are diverting much of their crude into the local market rather than nominating volumes to SOMO for pipeline export. Output is being throttled (some wells left under-utilized, drilling programs paused, and operational ramp-ups on hold) a deliberate tactic to preserve leverage. Their arrears, estimated near a billion dollars, remain unpaid, and the new contract terms cap returns at a flat per-barrel service fee, far below the profit-oil model they previously operated under. With the export agreement only running on 30-day renewals through year-end, DNO and Genel are signaling they won’t sink fresh capital or restore plateau volumes until arrears and terms are resolved. The net effect is that Ceyhan flows are restarting at ~180-190 kbpd instead of approaching the 400+ kbpd capacity, highlighting that without these two operators’ full participation, northern exports will remain constrained and the political settlement fragile. The Kremlin is pushing hard against EU plans to tap frozen Russian assets, calling it theft and warning of retaliation. Brussels is weighing whether to use only the windfall interest or move toward seizing principal, with Washington pressing for the latter. Moscow is framing this as a direct attack on the sanctity of reserve holdings, with obvious implications for non-aligned states watching how safe their own money is in Western banks. Countermeasures are already being floated — expropriation of European assets still inside Russia, financial restrictions, commodity leverage. The warning lands just as Brussels debates tighter enforcement on oil sanctions, which only sharpens Moscow’s line that Europe is shifting from financial freeze to outright confiscation. Discovery & Development BP just approved a $5 billion spend on its Tiber–Guadalupe deepwater project in the U.S. Gulf, marking one of its biggest bets there in over a decade. The hub will tie in discoveries, including Tiber (2009) and Guadalupe (2014), targeting ~80,000 bpd at peak with first oil slated for 2032. BP is positioning this as part of its Paleogene push, where Chevron (CVX), Exxon (XOM) and Shell (SHEL) are also advancing high-cost but long-life plays. The move reflects a renewed appetite for mega-projects in the Gulf just as global majors juggle capital discipline with extending oil output. Exxon is trying to revive its Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique, a ~$30 billion development stalled since 2020 by insurgent violence in Cabo Delgado. CEO Darren Woods met this week with President Filipe Nyusi to push for tighter security guarantees so Exxon can restart. FID has now shifted to 2026. Rovuma would export 18 mtpa, bringing Mozambique closer to the status of Qatar and the U.S. as a top LNG supplier if it moves forward. MidOcean Energy, backed by EIG and Saudi Aramco, just bought a 20% stake in Petronas’ upstream gas assets tied to LNG Canada, one of the biggest export projects under construction. The deal plugs MidOcean into a 14 mtpa development led by Shell (SHEL) and expected online in 2025–26. LNG Canada is already oversubscribed on volumes, with Phase 2 under study that could double capacity. For Aramco, the move builds exposure to North American LNG just as Asian buyers scramble to lock in long-term supply. India has revealed a natural gas discovery in the Andaman Sea basin, a frontier area long thought to hold sizable untapped reserves. The find is being called a potential game-changer for India’s energy security, with ONGC leading exploration and officials hinting that it could open a new gas province. India imports more than half its gas, so even modest output here could ease the bill and reduce reliance on LNG cargoes. Development will hinge on further appraisal drilling and whether infrastructure can be built to move gas to demand centers on the east coast. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions Berkshire Hathaway just agreed to buy Occidental Petroleum’s OxyChem unit for $9.7B in cash, marking Warren Buffett’s largest acquisition in years. For Oxy (OXY), the sale trims debt after its $55B Anadarko buyout left the balance sheet stretched, while keeping focus on upstream oil and Permian growth. OxyChem is one of North America’s biggest PVC and chlorine producers, so Berkshire is getting a defensive cash-flow engine with long-cycle demand. The deal shows Buffett is still willing to swing big in energy, even as Oxy doubles down on crude. BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is in late-stage talks to buy AES Corp. in a $38B deal including debt. It would be one of the largest utility takeovers in U.S. history. AES has been building out renewable generation and supplying power to hyperscale data centers, making it a prime target as AI-driven electricity demand soars. For BlackRock, it’s a chance to grab a regulated cash-flow engine with growth optionality in renewables. The deal isn’t final yet, but if sealed, it would underscore how AI is reshaping utility M&A just as fast as it’s reshaping power demand. Tamboran Resources is moving to acquire Falcon Oil & Gas in a ~$172M all-stock deal, consolidating control of Australia’s Beetaloo Basin. The basin is viewed as one of the country’s biggest undeveloped shale gas plays, with Tamboran pushing to unlock LNG export potential as Asian demand rises. Falcon shareholders will get about 10% of the combined group, giving Tamboran full operatorship across key permits. The move is aimed at accelerating drilling scale and positioning Beetaloo as a future competitor to U.S. shale and Qatar LNG. BKV Corp just closed a $370M deal to buy Barnett shale assets from BHP’s old North Texas portfolio, adding ~300 MMcfe/d of production. The Barnett is mature but still cash-flowing, and BKV (already one of the top U.S. private gas producers) is betting it can squeeze more value through efficiency and scale. The acquisition lifts BKV’s footprint in the play to nearly 500,000 net acres. It’s another sign that while big publics chase LNG-linked growth, privates are still finding bargains in legacy shale gas. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Bitcoin Supercycle? Jeff Park Says Gold’s $1 Trillion Gains Could Spark It
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-supercycle-jeff-park-gold-1-trillion/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T10:15:14Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a wide-ranging interview with Anthony Pompliano published on October 2, Jeff Park, partner and Chief Investing Officer at ProCap BTC, argued that gold’s surging price and shifting global ownership patterns are not a threat to Bitcoin—but potentially the catalyst for its next structural leg higher. Park’s thesis centers on flows, geopolitics, and balance-sheet mechanics: if policymakers and large allocators learn to tap the paper gains embedded in sovereign gold holdings, they could redirect a meaningful slice of that liquidity into Bitcoin and ignite what he repeatedly framed as a supercycle. “The math is pretty simple,” Park said. “What if we find a way to unlock the ability to build leverage on the paper gains of gold to take a call option on Bitcoin? There’s something incredible here that could happen.” In his back-of-the-envelope scenario, “a trillion dollars of Bitcoin is actually hugely impactful for the bitcoin market.” He contrasted the magnitude of such an impulse with the size of the US fiscal problem, suggesting that while a trillion dollars is small relative to public debt, it would be outsized in a young asset with finite supply and thin free float. Park’s remarks were prompted by a simple question: why is gold ripping while Bitcoin has lagged on a relative basis? He did not dispute gold’s leadership—calling it “the story of the year”—but argued the drivers differ. Gold is presently the venue for acute geopolitical expression and central-bank rebalancing, while Bitcoin’s adoption curve hinges on institutional flows that are still ramping. “Ultimately [these markets] are driven by flows,” he said, adding that Bitcoin’s flows are “inevitable” so long as the institutional agenda advances with “focused deliberation.” A crucial plank of Park’s framework is the changing geography of gold. He pointed to two simultaneous realities: the headline that US gold reserves have reached a large notional value because of price—and the under-discussed fact that the US share of global official gold has sunk over decades. “At one point post-World War II the US had over 50% of the world’s global gold reserve supply as a central bank and now it’s less than 20%. So who’s making up for the compensation on their side? Likely China and many other BRIC countries in the lead.” That shift, Park argued, helps explain the persistence of gold’s bid. China, in his telling, is exerting influence not only through accumulation but also by building market infrastructure. He highlighted “the launch of the Shanghai Gold Exchange” and the rise of “the Shanghai Futures Exchange,” observing that “physical gold now actually trades in China” at a scale once associated with London. In a symbolic move earlier this year, “for the first time [they] opened up vaults in Hong Kong to allow offshore investors to put their gold in reserves,” a step Park sees as part of a longer-term strategy to enhance the creditworthiness of CNY-settled commodity trade. Park then connected this gold realignment to Bitcoin’s addressable demand. He referred to the scenario in which the US takes the massive unrealized gains on its gold if marked at market and either revalues or borrows against those gains to purchase Bitcoin for its strategic reserve under President Donald Trump. “Gold has been marked at the Treasury at $42 an ounce and we all know right now it’s trading at [roughly] 3850… There’s a trillion dollars of basically paper gains.” In that context, he argued that leveraging paper gains into a scarce digital reserve asset could be a high-beta upgrade to the sovereign balance sheet. Pressed on the political feasibility, Park distinguished between executive action and legislation. “The executive path is a great starting point to create a watershed moment,” he said, but “no democratic coalition is truly bought in until a legislative motion.” The former could demonstrate intent; the latter would make a Bitcoin reserve strategy “irreversible” and align it with the broader social mandate he associates with sound-money adoption. The crux of his “supercycle” framing is compounding. Park walked through return profiles to quantify why a large base allocation, even if financed, could matter over time. “If you own Bitcoin and you assume that it’s going to go up by 12% a year, you’ll make a 30x in 30 years… If you think it’s actually going to go up by 40% per year, which is what the [asset] has been otherwise annualizing, it’s 10 years.” He stressed that the point is not to promise those numbers, but to illustrate how modest annualized returns can cover meaningful fiscal gaps when the base is large enough and the asset is credibly scarce. Park also addressed why Bitcoin has not matched gold’s recent pace. Part of the answer, he suggested, is optics: Bitcoin is “living, breathing software” that evolves via open debate, whereas gold’s appeal is its millennia-long immutability. The transparency of Bitcoin’s governance can spook newcomers who only see the noise. “If I were outside and I was a BlackRock ETF buyer and I listened to the conversation that’s happening between the Bitcoin developers, I might say, ‘Hold on a second. This is crazy stuff.’” Even so, he framed current developer disputes—such as arguments over relay policy or spam-filter defaults—as hygiene issues, not existential ones. They matter for performance and propagation, but not for the core monetary assurances: “21 million or bust.” He invoked the lessons of the block-size war to explain why the system’s checks and balances are a feature, not a bug. “Ultimately, who is running consensus at Bitcoin?… The node clients are very valuable and they are in control versus miners and their self-interests. And that was a huge moment because it showed you decentralization was alive.” The line between hard-coded rules and socially enforced norms will always invite argument, he conceded, but in his view that process “future-proof[s] Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value.” Throughout, Park returned to flows. Gold’s flows, in his assessment, are being pulled by geopolitics and central-bank behavior—especially in Asia. Bitcoin’s flows will be pulled by institutional adoption and, potentially, by policy innovation that converts dormant balance-sheet strength into active demand. That is why he sees the assets as complements within the same macro problem set rather than rivals fighting for a single inflow. “Gold’s greatest cultural power is its impermanent fixture in our mindset and its durability for eons,” he said. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers sovereignty, portability, and programmability that younger cohorts find intuitive. “Young people are mentally more able to do things that older people can’t… the trend of young people understanding digital store of wealth… is the big picture.” I spoke with @dgt10011 on whether we should be worried about bitcoin lagging gold’s performance, durability of bitcoin vs gold, how to think about bitcoin as living software, and a new theme referencing the retardification of society. Enjoy! YouTube: https://t.co/kwCRnibemU… pic.twitter.com/0BckI7h7Eb — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) October 3, 2025 If that generational shift meets a government-level balance-sheet pivot, Park believes the market structure can change quickly. “A trillion dollars of Bitcoin is hugely impactful,” he repeated, not because it solves everything overnight, but because it reorganizes incentives for issuers, custodians, and policymakers around a credibly scarce digital reserve. In that world, the present period—where gold leads and Bitcoin consolidates—may be remembered not as divergence, but as staging. “Bitcoin will catch up,” Park said. “These are ultimately driven by flows.” And if those flows are seeded by the very gold rally now commanding headlines, the supercycle label he’s willing to use may not be hyperbole, but simply a description of how compounding works when new liquidity finally meets hard caps.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. It is pertinent to mention that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been vocal critics of the H-1B visa programme and have consistently contended that these visas are being abused by many to replace US workers with cheaper labour from overseas. In fact, just a few days after their missive to the ten companies, the senators said they are reintroducing bipartisan legislation to "reform and close loopholes" in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act targets fraud and abuse in US immigration system, provides protection for American workers and visa holders and enhances transparency in the foreign worker recruitment process, the two argued. "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the US on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions." On TCS, the statement noted that the company recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. "In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favour of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders," it said. It further said Cognizant Technology Solutions laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the US. "In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favoured South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages," it added. E-mails sent to TCS and Cognizant for comments by PTI did not elicit a response. The statement by Grassley and Durbin noted that Amazon laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Google, it said, laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 per cent of its small team managers "despite enjoying records profits". In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees, the statement observed. According to it, Meta laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labelled it a "year of efficiency". "In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five per cent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees," it said. Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees in fiscal year 2025, as per the statement. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits, it said adding amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterised its actions as an "enigma of success".

Title: How Microsoft Stock Rises 2x To $1,000
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/03/how-microsoft-stock-rises-2x-to-1000/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. We are fond of companies that generate cash. A lot of cash. What about 2% of market capitalization? Microsoft’s stock is valued at $3.9 trillion and generated $71.6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025, which is about 1.8% of its market capitalization. On a per-share basis, that’s $9.60 of free cash flow for a $520 stock. What’s not to adore? This cash accumulates on the balance sheet, can be reinvested, and fuels buybacks. Microsoft’s operating cash flow margin is at 48.3%, resulting in $136 billion from $282 billion in revenue. Net income? An astonishing $102 billion – a net margin of approximately 36%, marking the inaugural occasion that Microsoft surpassed the $100 billion profit threshold. The balance sheet resembles a fortress, boasting $95 billion in cash compared to $61 billion in debt, indicating a robust net cash position. Simultaneously, Microsoft returned $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks within the last twelve months alone. See – Why Microsoft Stock Is A Shareholder’s Paradise? – for additional insights. Although Microsoft stock has experienced a strong year, appreciating by 24% and surpassing the NASDAQ’s 18% gain, the crucial question now is: Is there still room for Microsoft stock to grow? An in-depth examination of the company's fundamentals indicates that the answer is yes, as growth is swiftly accelerating. Microsoft reported impressive results for fiscal year 2025, with revenue and operating income rising in the mid to high teens. A key contributor to this performance is the Intelligent Cloud segment. Azure alone surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, exhibiting remarkable growth of 34% year-over-year. Artificial Intelligence (AI) services are a major tailwind, accounting for 19 percentage points of that growth. The company is sustained by several massive, long-term growth drivers—most notably, the expansion of its AI offerings. These factors are anticipated to drive the stock to significantly higher levels, potentially doubling from its current price to exceed $1,000. We will delve into these specific growth drivers in greater detail. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is this the case? The HQ Portfolio stocks as a group have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; showcasing less volatility, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What’s Next For CoreWeave Stock? Let’s analyze the figures. Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, showing an accelerating growth trend. With AI adoption driving sustained annual revenue growth of 17% and margin expansion through operational leverage, sales could reach $450 billion by 2028. Microsoft’s operating margins are expected to expand to 50% as high-margin AI services scale up and operational efficiency improves. This equates to roughly $225 billion in operating income, or about $180 billion in net income after taxes. With ongoing share repurchases decreasing the float, the share count could trend toward 7.2 billion shares. This would imply an EPS of around $25 per share by 2028. Now, let’s discuss valuation. While Microsoft currently trades at 38 times trailing earnings (based on fiscal 2025 results), its AI monetization narrative justifies a premium valuation. Given Microsoft’s robust growth, superior margins, and strong cash flow generation, we do not expect any significant compression in multiples over the next three years. Despite Microsoft’s promising outlook, potential risks could impede the stock from doubling. The most significant concern is the normalization of AI spending, where businesses may become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current investment pace may not be sustainable indefinitely. Additionally, heightened competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging entities could exert pressure on Microsoft’s AI pricing power and market share growth. See, investing in a single stock without a thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive method to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Microsoft's investment appeal is compelling. Record cash generation of $72 billion and an indomitable balance sheet finance both aggressive AI infrastructure investments and steady shareholder returns, while diverse exposure across cloud, AI, enterprise software, and gaming diminishes risk and positions the company for continued long-term growth. The anticipated $70 billion AI infrastructure investment fosters competitive advantages that enhance market share growth, with additional upside potential arising from AI-driven margin expansion while sustaining accelerating growth. That said, investors should judiciously consider the risks prior to investing in Microsoft.

October 03, 2025 05:52 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Unmanned Ground Vehicles" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report explores emergent trends within the UGV market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote sensors, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.UGVs are finally making a mark in modern warfare, and their use can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome developmental hurdles, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves public and private investment in the sector and constant experimentation in Ukraine.Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been a distant second thought for those thinking about the future of unmanned warfare. Indeed, Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), but until recently, UGVs have rarely been mentioned. Yet warfare drives innovation, and the UGV sector has been developed by Ukrainian fighters seeking to manage personnel shortages. Since the start of that war, the use of UGVs for logistical, engineering, surveillance, and combat support roles has exploded, and Ukraine now plans to deliver 15,000 ground robots for combat use by the end of 2025. While it is important to recognize that UGVs still account for a fraction of the total of unmanned support in conflicts, the utility of UGVs has at long last been exploited by those on the battlefield. Modern UGVs are now suitable for a wide variety of defense and security applications beyond the traditionally limited scope of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), with nations including China, France, India, Russia, the UK, and the US developing logistics, ISR, and combat-capable UGV platforms.To capitalize on the growth of the UGV market, key industry players have been investing heavily in expanding their research, development, and manufacturing capabilities, with both established defense primes like Rheinmetall and KMW as well as emerging players such as EDGE Group engaging in mergers and acquisitions of specialist firms within the UGV supply chain to pre-emptively secure market shares in an emerging capability sector. Firms with expertise in associated technologies such as AI, weapons systems, mobility solutions, and power supply/management will also benefit from growing demand as the diversified applications for UGVs provide new opportunities to engage with primes and forge strategic partnerships to cement their positions within the supply chain.Studies of emerging technological trends and their broader impact on the defense market.Analysis of the various unmanned ground vehicle programs and projects currently under development, as well as the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence on the future outlook of the unmanned ground vehicles theme.Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/3bitvn About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: How posting on TikTok helped this 22-year-old land a software engineering role at Amazon after a yearlong job hunt

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, Andrew Chen couldn't stop thinking about the ticking clock. He was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. Then a glimmer of hope landed in his inbox: an email from Amazon inviting him to interview for a software engineering role in 10 days. He knew he couldn't waste the opportunity, so he made a plan: hole up in his room to study — and document his preparation for the big day on TikTok to hold himself accountable. "I canceled all my social obligations, locked myself in my room, and basically only left the house to have lunch," said the 22-year-old. "I was thinking, if I don't get this job, this is all for nothing." Chen is among the many recent college graduates who have struggled to find work. As of June, the most recent data available, 4.8% of Americans ages 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor's degree were unemployed — higher than the 4.0% jobless rate among the broader working-age population, a reversal from the typical trend in recent decades. These challenges reflect a broader hiring slowdown that's hit entry-level job seekers especially hard. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are hiring at one of the slowest paces since 2014. Tech professionals, including computer science graduates like Chen, have been particularly affected, with layoffs at firms including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. On Indeed, US software development job postings have declined by over 70% from their peak in 2022. While some new graduates are still searching, others, like Chen, have used creative job-search and interview preparation strategies to secure offers. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above — or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com (or Signal at jzinkula.29). You can also find more of our job market coverage below: Chen began looking for a full-time job in the summer of 2024. As a computer science major, he'd always envisioned starting his career in software engineering. But after applying to more than 400 jobs and struggling to gain traction, he expanded his search to include product management and design roles. But he didn't give up on software engineering. Between September 2024 and early February 2025, Chen applied to several software engineering roles at Amazon. In mid-February, he was asked to complete an online assessment for one of the roles he had applied to — he's still unsure exactly which one — that included a coding test and behavioral questions. He thought he had done well — news he excitedly shared with his parents — but as the months passed, he never received an update about his application status. "My parents would keep asking for updates on Amazon because it's a name brand," he said. "And I eventually told them I got rejected — I thought if I hadn't heard from them after months, it's probably not going to happen." By the time Amazon reached out in May, Chen said he was deep in interviews for product management and design roles — and had nearly given up on software engineering entirely. The unexpected opportunity to return to his preferred field was welcome, but its timing posed a challenge. After focusing on other types of roles, he'd largely stopped practicing his coding skills and would need to quickly brush up before the interview. Chen had just 10 days to prepare — and still had to carve out time for interviews with other companies, in addition to school exams and final projects. So he developed a plan of attack, dividing his days into blocks for coding practice on LeetCode, behavioral prep, and studying for other interviews. He set out to read everything he could on platforms like Reddit and Blind about Amazon's interview process and past candidates' experiences, practice common technical questions, study the company's leadership principles, and memorize STAR-format personal stories that illustrated how he embodied those values. "This was the first big company that had given me a chance in a while," he said, "so I really wanted to get this one." But pulling this all off seemed daunting, and Chen felt he needed something to help him stay motivated. Then he had an idea. He'd been interested in creating social media content for a while but had only posted a handful of TikToks. What if he started documenting his preparation for the Amazon interview? Sharing updates publicly on TikTok, he figured, would add the kind of pressure he needed to stay locked in — and maybe even attract advice from others who'd been through the process. On May 19, Chen posted a TikTok with the caption "10 days until FAANG final interview," sharing how much prep he'd done, how many classes he'd skipped, how much caffeine he'd consumed, and how many showers he'd taken. He followed it with similar updates in the days that followed. Chen said his videos — which received as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions, including skepticism that he could land the role given his limited preparation time. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," he said. When interview day arrived in late May, Chen was anxious and sleep-deprived. He said his Amazon "loop" interview process consisted of three back-to-back virtual interviews with short breaks in between. The first round focused on technical questions, the second on behavioral scenarios tied to Amazon's leadership principles, and the third included a mix of both. "I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed," he said. Chen gradually settled in as the day went on and left the interviews feeling like he'd done his best. On June 3, shortly after finishing his third interview of the day for non-Amazon roles, he saw an email notification on his phone. He'd received an offer from Amazon with a six-figure salary. On June 5, Chen posted a TikTok with the news that received over 941,000 views. He graduated in mid-June and, after moving to New York City, started working full-time in July. Chen said his biggest takeaway from the Amazon interviews was the company's emphasis on behavioral questions tied to its leadership principles — something he felt played to his strengths. "They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise," he said. "I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that." One of his top pieces of advice for job seekers: while application quality matters, volume is essential in a tough market. "Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game," he said. "You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for." Jump to

Title: BlackRock, Fidelity pile in as crypto companies raise $3.3bn in September

About us Copy link Seventy-seven crypto companies raised over $3.3 billion in September, according to DefiLlama data. That brings the total funding for crypto companies to over $17 billion so far in 2025, outpacing 2024’s total by over $7 billion. And analysts say investment in the space is only accelerating. PitchBook predicts that the industry will raise $18 billion this year. Investors from Galaxy Ventures and Codebase expect it to go even higher and that investors will plough over $25 billion into the industry in 2025. Here are the crypto companies that raised the most money in September. Blockchain lender Figure Technology pulled off one of the year’s biggest crypto-linked floats, raising $787.5 million in its Nasdaq debut valuing the company at about $5.3 billion. Founded in 2018 by former SoFi chief Mike Cagney, Figure builds blockchain infrastructure to power loans and exchanges. It has already funded more than $16 billion in loans and is expanding into crypto-backed lending and digital asset trading. Superstar investors including legendary trader Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office have lined up for the offering. Kraken recently closed a $500 million fundraising round at a $15 billion valuation, a final step before its planned IPO, Fortune reported. To be sure, Kraken has not publicly confirmed the raise. The raise was, according to Fortune, part of Kraken’s plans to go public. It hinted as far back as 2021 that it planned to debut on the stock market, but those plans were delayed due to market downturns and conflicts with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. Yet, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi recently told DL News in an exclusive interview that the company doesn’t have any plans to follow rival exchanges Bullish and Gemini and file for an initial public offering. “If we were a part of what I call the pack of companies that have FOMO to go public, then we would have already filed,” he told DL News. He also said that Kraken did raise money as part of its drive to acquire NinjaTrade, a retail futures trading platform, for $1.5 billion in March. That raise, Sethi told DL News, put Kraken’s valuation at $15 billion. Rapyd, the global fintech platform for cross-border payments, has closed a $500 million Series F round backed by Wall Street titans including BlackRock, Fidelity, General Catalyst, and Dragoneer. The raise aims to bring deep liquidity pools, crypto-as-a-service, fiat on- and off-ramps, and custody solutions to Rapyd’s platform. Rapyd, meanwhile, is preparing new web3 offerings aimed at bridging digital assets and traditional finance across payments, DeFi and embedded finance.

Title: Iren: Company built by two Sydney brothers Dan and Will Roberts now worth more than ASX

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Three years ago a computer company built by two Sydney brothers, Dan and Will Roberts, looked like it was going broke. On Friday morning shares in their datacentre business, Iren, hit a record high in the US, turning them into Australia’s newest billionaires. Iren is worth around $19 billion, or more than Qantas Airways or the Australian Securities Exchange, which wasn’t interested in the Bitcoin miner when it tried to float in 2021. Trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market instead, the stock has risen 678 per cent over the past six months, driven by demand for AI-specialist computer servers the brothers lease out to big technology companies. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Based on Thursday’s trading, the brothers are worth $1.06 billion each, placing 35-year-old Will among the richest ten Australians under 40. Daniel is 41. The brothers attended Sydney boys school Saint Ignatius’ College and studied business at University of Technology, Sydney. Both men declined to comment on their new wealth. A professional investor who follows the stock, Shaun Weick at Wilson Asset Management, said they had perfectly timed a shift from Bitcoin mining to Artificial Intelligence. “Some might say they’re lucky, some might say it’s skill,” he said. “It’s probably both, but they’ve been very clever pitching themselves with bitcoin and are now big beneficiaries of the AI story.” Three years ago it was unclear the company would survive. The shares had fallen 96 per cent. The business was bleeding cash and fighting off creditors who claimed they were owed more than $US100 million ($150 million). On December 28, 2022, the stock hit $US1.06. On Thursday it hit an intraday high of $US49.39. Before starting their own investment business, the brothers worked at investment bank Macquarie in Sydney, gaining experience across the capital market advisory, infrastructure, and renewable energy investment sectors, which their bitcoin and AI business now straddles. Daniel is a self-confessed bitcoin apostle. He regularly predicts the digital token’s price will hit a $US1 million by 2030. He’s also a keen skier, golfer, and AFL fan, who spends his time between the company’s data centre sites in Texas in the US and homes in Sydney, with a farmstead in regional New South Wales. He regularly flies between Sydney and Houston on Qantas, and doesn’t mind reminding Australians that he was rejected in his home town. “After the brown cardigans at the ASX rejected us due to their anti-technology stance, IREN - now ASX100 scale - was forced to list overseas. I know others haven’t even bothered trying locally as a result,” he wrote on LinkedIn a few months ago. In response the ASX said it doesn’t comment on individual companies, but has supported around 190 prior tech-specific floats and 11 are worth more than $10 billion. “We consider a range of factors when evaluating an entity’s suitability for listing, including the organisational structure and the nature of its business operations,” a spokesperson said. Iren’s ASX listing likely failed because it was a bitcoin miner, which was an alien quantity to regulators in 2021. The company was known as Iris Energy before changing its name in 2024. In November 2021, the brothers tied their company to bitcoin’s fortunes by listing it on the Nasdaq at the peak of a pandemic-era tech stock and crypto bubble linked to ultra-low interest rates and government money printing. The fastest interest rate hikes in a generation sent the business down 96 per cent into a near death spiral in 2022, before it recovered in line with rising bitcoin prices and a investor mania for companies linked to AI. Early investors included billionaire Atlassian co-founder and climate change activist Mike Cannon-Brookes via his Grok family office. Grok was attracted to Iris Energy’s initial business plan as a renewable energy powered data centre operator in Canada where hydro power is abundant. The brothers shifted from a clean energy data centre dream to zero-emission bitcoin mining in 2020 and shifted to leasing servers to AI operators in 2023. “They’ve just done a great job in pivoting the company,” said Wilson’s Mr Weick. “Bitcoin mining was first pitched as the key focus [to investors] and the [renewable energy] cost of compute would be their edge to generate profits and that’s another factor as we now move into AI. “They’ve also been appointed as an Nvidia preferred partner and that places them in a good position to access chips and build out capacity.” Their jaw-dropping success has drawn controversy. Creditors in the US sued them in Australian courts, claiming Iren owed $US107.3 million for bitcoin computers. The company got hit by a US short seller report last July. Culper Research labelled Iren “a painfully transparent stock promotion”. It called Iren’s claims that it could pivot into high performance computing (HPC) “nonsense” and pointed out the company had spent $US716 million since its inception. Iren has previously declined to answer questions about how a halving of the reward for mining bitcoins in April, 2024, affected its business. The short seller claimed the business would be “decimated” as it meant the same amount of computing power cost was needed for half the amount of bitcoin to be mined as a reward. Iren’s latest accounts show it earnt $US486.4 million from bitcoin mining last year at a cost in electricity of $US157.7 million. Net profit reached $US86.9 million. Share traders have largely dismissed the short seller’s claims and decided the Australian-led business is a potentially big AI beneficiary. Professional investors are largely on board too. On August 29, analysts at the brothers’ former employer, Macquarie Group, suggested their professional experience and expertise in conventional energy and infrastructure development gave them an edge. It noted they could use their experience to raise money to buy instal more servers with Nvidia computer chips for data centres that tech companies need to train their AI models on. The company has borrowed close to $US1 billon to fund expansion. Big investors include Blackrock, Fidelity and Citadel. Macquarie’s analysts say Iren is at risk from a fall in the bitcoin price. Both brothers are steadily cashing out of a business still largely tied to the fortunes of bitcoin. On September 11, they sold 1 million shares each for around $US66.4 million ($98 million) between them. In total both retain 13.99 million shares individually, worth $1.06 billion based on Thursday’s share price. Copy Link Copied Has relationship bliss finally ended Taylor Swift’s creative run?

Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our expanded daily Links Yves here. This is a devastating, must-read paper by Servaas Storm on how AI is failing to meet core, repeatedly hyped performance promises, and never can, irrespective of how much money and computing power is thrown at it. Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” is still garnering worse-than-dot-com-frenzy valuations even as errors are if anything increasing. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website This paper argues that (i) we have reached “peak GenAI” in terms of current Large Language Models (LLMs); scaling (building more data centers and using more chips) will not take us further to the goal of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI); returns are diminishing rapidly; (ii) the AI-LLM industry and the larger U.S. economy are experiencing a speculative bubble, which is about to burst. The U.S. is undergoing an extraordinary AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to exceptionally high valuations of AI-related tech firms, which are fueling economic growth by the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars they are spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels. But the summer of 2025 did not bring good news for enthusiasts of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) who were all hyped up by the inflated promise of the likes of OpenAI’s Sam Altman that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI), the holy grail of current AI research, would be right around the corner. Let us more closely consider the hype. Already in January 2025, Altman wrote that “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”. Altman’s optimism echoed claims by OpenAI’s partner and major financial backer Microsoft, which had put out a paper in 2023 claiming that the GPT-4 model already exhibited “sparks of AGI.” Elon Musk (in 2024) was equally confident that the Grok model developed by his company xAI would reach AGI, an intelligence “smarter than the smartest human being”, probably by 2025 or at least by 2026. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his company was committed to “building full general intelligence”, and that super-intelligence is now “in sight”. Likewise, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said “powerful AI”, i.e., smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in any field, could come as early as 2026, and usher in a new age of health and abundance — the U.S. would become a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, if ….. AI didn’t wind up killing us all. For Mr. Musk and his GenAI fellow travelers, the biggest hurdle on the road to AGI is the lack of computing power (installed in data centers) to train AI bots, which, in turn, is due to a lack of sufficiently advanced computer chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would exceed the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. Spurred by the imperative to win the AI-race with China, the GenAI propagandists firmly believe that the U.S. can be put on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City of AGI by building more data centers faster (an unmistakenly “accelerationist” expression). Interestingly, AGI is an ill-defined notion, and perhaps more of a marketing concept used by AI promotors to persuade their financiers to invest in their endeavors. Roughly, the idea is that an AGI model can generalize beyond specific examples found in its training data, similar to how some human beings can do almost any kind of work after having been shown a few examples of how to do a task, by learning from experience and changing methods when needed. AGI bots will be capable of outsmarting human beings, creating new scientific ideas, and doing innovative as well as all of routine coding. AI bots will be telling us how to develop new medicines to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our genetically modified crops. Hence, in a radical bout of creative destruction, AGI would transform not just the economy and the workplace, but also systems of health care, energy, agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, R&D, innovation and science. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go.” He “think[s] we know what to do,” saying that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PhD.” Announcing the launch of ChatGPT-5 in August, Mr. Altman posted on the internet that “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous Al. It is useful, it is smart, it is fast [and] intuitive. With GPT-5 now, it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD level expert in anything any area you need on demand, they can help you with whatever your goals are.” But then things began to fall apart, and rather quickly so. ChatGPT-5 Is a Letdown The first piece of bad news is that much-hyped ChatGPT-5 turned out to be a dud — incremental improvements wrapped in a routing architecture, nowhere near the breakthrough to AGI that Sam Altman had promised. Users are underwhelmed. As the MIT Technology Review reports: “The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it’s still far short of AGI.” Worryingly, OpenAI’s internal tests show GPT-5 ‘hallucinates’ in circa one in 10 responses of the time on certain factual tasks, when connected to the internet. However, without web-browsing access, GPT-5 is wrong in almost 1 in 2 responses, which should be troublesome. Even more worrisome, ‘hallucinations’ may also reflect biases buried within datasets. For instance, an LLM might ‘hallucinate’ crime statistics that align with racial or political biases simply because it has learned from biased data. Of note here is that AI chatbots can be and are actively used to spread misinformation (see here and here). According to recent research, chatbots spread false claims when prompted with questions about controversial news topics 35% of the time — almost double the 18% rate of a year ago (here). AI curates, orders, presents, and censors information, influencing interpretation and debate, while pushing dominant (average or preferred) viewpoints while suppressing alternatives, quietly removing inconvenient facts or making up convenient ones. The key issue is: Who controls the algorithms? Who sets the rules for the tech bros? It is evident that by making it easy to spread “realistic-looking” misinformation and biases and/or suppress critical evidence or argumentation, GenAI does and will have non-negligible societal costs and risks — which have to be counted when assessing its impacts. Building Larger LLMs Is Leading Nowhere The ChatGPT-5 episode raises serious doubts and existential questions about whether the GenAI industry’s core strategy of building ever-larger models on ever-larger data distributions has already hit a wall. Critics, including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus (here and here), have long argued that simply scaling up LLMs will not lead to AGI, and GPT-5’s sorry stumbles do validate those concerns. It is becoming more widely understood that LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching — which is why, for example, they still cannot even play chess reliably and continue to make mind-boggling errors with startling regularity. My new INET Working Paper discusses three sobering research studies showing that novel ever-larger GenAI models do not become better, but worse, and do not reason, but rather parrot reasoning-like text. To illustrate, a recent paper by scientists at MIT and Harvard shows that even when trained on all of physics, LLMs fail to uncover even the existing generalized and universal physical principles underlying their training data. Specifically, Vafa et al. (2025) note that LLMs that follow a “Kepler-esque” approach: they can successfully predict the next position in a planet’s orbit, but fail to find the underlying explanation of Newton’s Law of Gravity (see here). Instead, they resort to fitting made-up rules, that allow them to successfully predict the planet’s next orbital position, but these models fail to find the force vector at the heart of Newton’s insight. The MIT-Harvard paper is explained in this video. LLMs cannot and do not infer physical laws from their training data. Remarkably, they cannot even identify the relevant information from the internet. Instead, they make it up. Worse, AI bots are incentivized to guess (and give an incorrect response) rather than admit they do not know something. This problem is recognized by researchers from OpenAI in a recent paper. Guessing is rewarded — because, who knows, it might be right. The error is at present uncorrectable. Accordingly, it might well be prudent to think of “Artificial Information” rather than “Artificial Intelligence” when using the acronym AI. The bottom line is straightforward: this is very bad news for anyone hoping that further scaling — building ever larger LLMs — would lead to better outcomes (see also Che 2025). 95% of Generative AI Pilot Projects in Companies Are Failing Corporations had rushed to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices. Then came the news that the AI tools are not doing what they are supposed to do and that people are realizing it (see Ed Zitron). An August 2025 report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, concludes that 95% of generative AI pilot projects in companies are failing to raise revenue growth. As reported by Fortune, “generic tools like ChatGPT [….] stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows”. Quite. Indeed, firms are backpedaling after cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing these by AI. For instance, Swedish “Buy Burritos Now, Pay Later” Klarna bragged in March 2024 that its AI assistant was doing the work of (laid-off) 700 workers, only to rehire them (sadly, as gig workers) in the summer of 2025 (see here). Other examples include IBM, forced to reemploy staff after laying off about 8,000 workers to implement automation (here). Recent U.S. Census Bureau data by firm size show that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees. MIT economist Daren Acemoglu (2025) predicts rather modest productivity impacts of AI in the next 10 years and warns that some applications of AI may have negative social value. “We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,” Acemoglu says. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.” Similarly, using two large-scale AI adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces) in Denmark, Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard (2025) show, in a recent NBER Working Paper, that the economic impacts of GenAI adoption are minimal: “AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects.” These findings provide a much-needed reality check for the hyperbole that GenAI is coming for all of our jobs. Reality is not even close. GenAI will not even make tech workers who do the coding redundant, contrary to the prediction by AI enthusiasts. OpenAI researchers have found (in early 2025) that advanced AI models (including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) still are no match for human coders. The AI bots failed to grasp how widespread bugs are or to understand their context, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. Another new study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) finds that in practice, programmers, using early 2025-AI-tools, are actually slower when using AI assistance tools, spending 19 percent more time when using GenAI than when actively coding by themselves (see here). Programmers spent their time on reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and correcting AI-generated code. The U.S. Economy at Large Is Hallucinating The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use. During 2024 and 2025, Big Tech firms invested a staggering $750 billion in data centers in cumulative terms and they plan to roll out a cumulative investment of $3 trillion in data centers during 2026-2029 (Thornhill 2025). The so-called “Magnificent 7” (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) spent more than $100 billion on data centers in the second quarter of 2025; Figure 1 gives the capital expenditures for four of the seven corporations. FIGURE 1 Christopher Mims (2025), https://x.com/mims/status/1951… The surge in corporate investment in “information processing equipment” is huge. According to Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, data center investments’ contribution to (sluggish) real U.S. GDP growth has been the same as consumer spending over the first half of 2025 (Figure 2). Financial investor Paul Kedrosky finds that capital expenditures on AI data centers (in 2025) have passed the peak of telecom spending during the dot-com bubble (of 1995-2000). FIGURE 2 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025). https://www.apolloacademy.com/… Following the AI hype and hyperbole, tech stocks have gone through the roof. The S&P500 Index rose by circa 58% during 2023-2024, driven mostly by the growth of the share prices of the Magnificent Seven. The weighted-average share price of these seven corporations increased by 156% during 2023-2024, while the other 493 firms experienced an average increase in their share prices of just 25%. America’s stock market is largely AI-driven. Nvidia’s shares rose by more than 280% over the past two years amid the exploding demand for its GPUs coming from the AI firms; as one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the insatiable demand for GenAI, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, which is the highest valuation ever recorded for a publicly traded company. Does this valuation make sense? Nvidia’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio peaked at 234 in July 2023 and has since declined to 47.6 in September 2025 — which is still historically very high (see Figure 3). Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. In key cases, as explained by Ed Zitron, Nvidia offered the neocloud companies, which are loss making, to buy unsold cloud compute worth billions of U.S. dollars, effectively backstopping its clients — all in the expectation of an AI revolution that still has to arrive. Likewise, the share price of Oracle Corp. (which is not included in the “Magnificent 7”) rose by more than 130% during mid-May and early September 2025 following the announcement of its $300 billion cloud-computing infrastructure deal with OpenAI. Oracle’s P/E ratio shot up to almost 68, which means that financial investors are willing to pay almost $68 for $1 of Oracle’s future earnings. One obvious problem with this deal is that OpenAI doesn’t have $300 billion; the company made a loss of $15 billion during 2023-2025 and is projected to make a further cumulative loss of $28 billion during 2026-2028 (see below). It is unclear and uncertain where OpenAI will get the money from. Ominously, Oracle needs to build the infrastructure for OpenAI before it can collect any revenue. If OpenAI cannot pay for the enormous computing capacity it agreed to buy from Oracle, which seems likely, Oracle will be left with the expensive AI infrastructure, for which it may not be able to find alternative customers, especially once the AI bubble fizzles out. Tech stocks thus are considerably overvalued. Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, warned (in July 2025) that AI stocks are even more overvalued than dot-com stocks were in 1999. In a blogpost, he illustrates how P/E ratios of Nvidia, Microsoft and eight other tech companies are higher than during the dot-com era (see Figure 3). We all remember how the dot-com bubble ended — and hence Sløk is right in sounding the alarm over the apparent market mania, driven by the “Magnificent 7” that are all heavily invested in the AI industry. Big Tech does not buy these data centers and operate them itself; instead the data centers are built by construction companies and then purchased by data center operators who lease them to (say) OpenAI, Meta or Amazon (see here). Wall Street private equity firms such as Blackstone and KKR are investing billions of dollars to buy up these data center operators, using commercial mortgage-backed securities as source funding. Data center real estate is a new, hyped-up asset class that is beginning to dominate financial portfolios. Blackstone calls data centers one of its “highest conviction investments.” Wall Street loves the lease-contracts of data centers which offer long-term stable, predictable income, paid by AAA-rated clients like AWS, Microsoft and Google. Some Cassandras are warning of a potential oversupply of data centers, but given that “the future will be based on GenAI”, what could possibly go wrong? FIGURE 3 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025), https://www.apolloacademy.com/… In a rare moment of frankness, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had it right. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco in August. “My opinion is yes.” He also compared today’s AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think,” Altman said. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money – we don’t know who …”, but (going by what happened in earlier bubbles) it will most likely not be Altman himself. The question therefore is: How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key firms in the GenAI race remains to be seen. Earnings of the AI industry continue to pale in comparison to the tens of billions of U.S. dollars that are spent on data center growth. According to an upbeat S&P Global research note published in June, 2025 the GenAI market is projected to generate $85 billion in revenue 2029. However, Alphabet, Google, Amazon and Meta together will spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone. At the same time, the AI industry has a combined revenue that is little more than the revenue of the smart-watch industry (Zitron 2025). So, what if GenAI just is not profitable? This question is pertinent in view of the rapidly diminishing returns to the stratospheric capital expenditures on GenAI and data centers and the disappointing user-experience of 95% of firms that adopted AI. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, Florida-based Elliott, told clients that AI is overhyped and Nvidia is in a bubble, adding that many AI products are “never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” “There are few real uses,” it said, other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”. It added that it was “skeptical” that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker’s graphics processing units in such high volumes. Locking billions of U.S. dollars in into AI-focused data centers without a clear exit strategy for these investments in case the AI craze ends, only means that systemic risk in finance and the economy is building. With data-center investments driving U.S. economic growth, the American economy has become dependent on a handful of corporations, which have not yet managed to generate one dollar of profit on the ‘compute’ done by these data center investments. America’s High-Stakes Geopolitical Get Gone Wrong The AI boom (bubble) developed with the support of both major political parties in the U.S. The vision of American firms pushing the AI frontier and reaching GenAI first is widely shared — in fact, there is a bipartisan consensus on how important it is that the U.S. should win the global AI race. America’s industrial capability is critically dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China. In this context, America’s lead in GenAI is considered to constitute a potential very powerful geopolitical lever: If America manages to get to AGI first, so the analysis goes, it can build up an overwhelming long-term advantage over especially China (see Farrell). That is the reason why Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the Trump administration are doubling down on the “AGI First” strategy. But astute observers highlight the costs and risks of this strategy. Prominently, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” Schmidt and Xu are rightly worried. Perhaps the plight of the U.S. economy is captured best by OpenAI’s Sam Altman who fantasizes about putting his data centers in space: “Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere around the solar system and say, “Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.”” For as long as such ‘hallucinations’ on using solar-collecting satellites to harvest (unlimited) star power continue to convince gullible financial investors, the government and users of the “magic” of AI and the AI industry, the U.S. economy is surely doomed. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” Clearly Altman doesn’t know how science is done. I have, for instance, done an AI search on a theme I used to be an expert years ago namely the cell-to-cell-movement of viruses in plants. With google AI what you obtain is a rehash of ideas more or less currently known. Very importantly, it comes without caveats, critical thinking and without any real experimental data already obtained with its experimental context. The first thing a researcher has to do is to be very critical on any data obtained before, conscientious that all that data was obtained in certain experimental conditions which very frequently result in situations in which the functioning of things are altered or controlled. In this sense, many research results are artificial artefacts and the results of research are often misleading and needing more checks and controls. I very well remember a congress (in Capetown 2001) about plasmodesmata , structures that bridge and communicate plant cells. Virus cell-to-cell movement was amongst the main issues in this small, very specialized, meeting. In a session dedicated to this issue there was a researcher exposing a vast body of research the lab had been doing using state-of-the-art methodology. This included data already published (several articles) and in the same line of research new data to be published soon with important conclusions. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. Starting any research with the very redacted rehash of ideas without any kind of critical thinking looks to me the exact recipe for hallucinatory AI-driven research. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. You’ve touched upon what AI boosters are hoping for (AGI) and what the limitations of the current state of affairs are and why humans will be sticking around, especially in knowledge generation fields, for some time still. I remember there being some links here on Naked Capitalism that touched on symbolic computation, and how that got discarded for machine learning/statistical approaches in AI, which were highly successful in tackling computer vision/classification problems, and led to a winter in research in symbolic methods, which researchers are slowly rediscovering will be essential for AGI. In this case, symbolic computation would be invaluable for any type of “thinking machine” to simplify contradictory information into abstract logical terms, recognize they form a contradictory set of statements, and then work around that to identify what could be the cause of contradiction, and how it could be resolved, while recognizing a limitation in its own knowledge set to be able to resolve it. Much of scientific research is dedicated to finding and resolving these contradictions. Phenomenon A predicts X happens in some novel set of circumstances. Phenomenon B predicts Y happens in the same novel set of circumstances. Except in pure mathematics, you can’t ‘reason’ your way through whether A and/or B will fail when tested in those novel circumstances. Likewise as you described, testing a phenomenon A in circumstances X and in presumably the same circumstances X’ generated different results. Reasoning can help identify what may caused different results in this instance, but current LLMs aren’t performing this type of reasoning. Anyone who’s knowledgeable in physics would understand these limitations. We’ve dedicated billions of hours of research into trying to reconcile quantum physics with general relativity, an instance of where two theories cannot be reconciled where both gravitational and quantum effects are significant. Much of that research gave us string theory, but string theory itself suffers from a lack of testable and verifiable circumstances, and also has gaps in certain circumstances. As for the life sciences, I’ve seen AI boosters try to remark that LLMs are extremely advanced, since now they’ve begun creating “designer viruses” or “designer gene therapies” that are engineered to achieve certain therapeutic or other effects. However, I’ve been frustrated to try and explain that first, it didn’t actually engineer it, it only proposed it, or “hallucinated it” as you said. Until it actually gets tested or synthesized in a lab, there might be some underlying principle it ignored in its proposal that will prevent synthesizing it. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs when everyone else catches on that simulating clerical work isn’t that profitable. All of these GPUs and hardware setups are well suited to be adapted into giant protein dynamic simulation clusters. However protein folding doesn’t sound as sexy to Silicon valley investors as replacing human workers. Thank you for your interesting reply Chris. Indeed, computing models are very useful for, for instance, simulating protein dynamics, their folding and changes these undergo under different conditions. There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed for such simulations. The simulations themselves are to be taken with (tons of) grains of salt. Scientists know that these are just simulations. I think that a big effort has been dedicated to obtain improved versions of RUBISCO, the protein that fixes CO2 to be incorporated in organic material and thought to be the most abundant protein in the world (here an example on Machine Learning to accelerate the process). This kind of work is termed in silico analysis. It isn’t obviously experimental. Whether ML will indeed accelerate the process or make it more complicated it is something that has not been readily shown in this case. It might be that other methods based on random procedures are more efficient and faster. Chris N: I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs Of course. That’s exactly what’s happening and biomedical research simulations are one intention. Among others. It’s naive to announce the bleeding obvious, that LLMs can’t hyperscale to more AI or to AGI — whatever that is — as the OP above and many commentators here do as if this were a revelation. Or to point out that LLM-based AI is a bubble. Of course, it is — that’s arguably the business model. The executives running the companies building these giant datacenters almost all went through the dotcom bubble, after all. Ask the next question. (You’re the only person here I’ve seen starting to do that, Chris.) What are they going to do with all that compute besides LLMs? How much compute are we talking about? Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer is El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, capable of 2.746 exaFLOPS — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer). Microsoft is building Fairwater, an AI-focused datecenter in Wisconsin, operational in 2026 that will by comparison supposedly do 17 exaFLOPS and, via massive GPU parallelism, achieve 10x El Capitan’s performance. And this is only one datacenter among others Microsoft is building and which we can presume therefore will get built. (As opposed to speculating, forex, about how much of the Oracle-Softbank-OpenAIStargate effort will come to fruition). So what other kinds of AI architectures can run in such datacenters. Over the next 3 years, here’s some of the roadmap — Large Physics Models (LPMs): Foundation models trained on physics texts, equations, and experimental data, capable of reasoning across scales—from QM to cosmology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): For modeling relational systems like molecules, social networks, or traffic flows, where entities and their interactions evolve dynamically. Neural PDE Solvers: AI systems that learn to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), for simulations in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and fusion energy. Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs): These simulate individual decision-makers (humans, cells, vehicles) whose behaviors evolve based on learned rules, for applications in economics, epidemiology, and urban planning. In 3-7 years’ time, the hope/intent is to leverage this massive datacenter compute to develop neuromorphic computing, which will need massively lower energy inputs (i.e. like the human brain). That way, AI can be pushed out the Edge, as it’s now being referred to, with the Edge meaning autonomous cars, robots, etc. Now, how much of this will happen? Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future. But one other factor needs consideration here: we’ve entered a period of geopolitical conflict, unrest, and war, and war generally accelerates technological development — e.g.the state of things pre-WW2 with biplanes and radio to post-WW2, five years later, with jets, rockets, television, and computers. And this is without the climate threat. So, this could a period of greater technological acceleration than we’ve seen in our lifetimes previously. Who’s they? This GPU compute needs to earn some kind of yield that compensates for the risk undertaken by the investors. And it’s only suitable for a handful of very specialized workloads. Who’s going to pay for this cool-sounding science stuff? Capitalists certainly are not altruistic. They can’t do anything like Uber-for-pets with it. Capitalists aren’t altruistic, but they are greedy, and are willing to invest large amounts of money into things if they think they’ll get a return from them, not because they necessarily or actually will get a return from them. In this case T Rowe price, Vanguard, and every other 401k or pension fund manager is basically putting money into this because of the predicted productivity ramifications from it. I.E. worker output is going to double translates to double value generated, translates to double revenue generated, translates to earnings increasing many times over. However, if that doesn’t materialize, and the bubble pops, there will be all of this hardware left over. Even if the hardware is old, it won’t actually be obsolete. I mentioned folding at home, because many of these types of simulations are embarrassingly parallel computational problems, or those where any computer of any power level can contribute towards calculations. Those GPUs will still be useful for anything that requires a lot of matrix multiplication. This means there will be discount sales for a lot of these data centers, providing opportunities for others companies or investors to buy them up for less than what it would have cost to construct them and buy the hardware new. This is the conspiracy that I’m alluding to: Entrepreneurs can’t pitch a use-biochemical-simulations-to-solve-aging start-up because the time horizon is too long, and initial captial cost too risky to convince non-technical investors to pitch in. But if they can convince them to put money into something that they see a return on, and use that to lower the initial capital cost for their own pet project, they’ll go ahead and do that and fund the entire endeavor for either themselves or their associates interested in those ideas after the crash. As a tangentially related thought, Elizabeth Holmes’ former partner is starting up another medical testing and diagnostics company. A lot of people from the Rational/Less-Wrong Sphere, who came up with Effective Altruism and Long-termism, have a deep cult-like interest in trying to overcome death, either by uploading consciousness into machines, or through mastering genetics and developing therapies to reverse aging. If these individuals lacked scruples to defraud investors via cryptocurrency (See Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX), I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re willing to defraud investors because in their moral calculus, raising lifespans to be 10x longer than they are now is worth it, even if some proportion of the population dies from impoverishment from the bubble crashing, because the net result was positive for the survivors. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. Interesting you mention this, a story in NY Times earlier this week some researchers at OpenAI left to do a startup that takes these kinds of inputs and then claims they’ll have robotic researchers that will actually perform the experimentation itself physically in a lab, presumably a brute force kind of approach to testing. I can only imagine the number of combinations that might need to be tested for any hypothesis. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish; they were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement. PapP: I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish Essentially, with some differences. AlphaFold used a transformer architecture to model relationships between amino acids similiarly to how LLMs model word dependencies and has attention mechanisms that work across both sequence and spatial dimensions, similarly to how LLMs track long-range dependencies in text. Differences were no autoregressive token prediction — AlphaFold doesn’t generate sequences, it infers structures — and optimization for protein folding, not open-ended tasks. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. ~~ Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? Certainly, it’ll give you the proof that the free LLM system for the masses that you used isn’t intelligent, but just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. But it tells you nothing about what specialized LLMs can achieve at full stretch. So, if you believe it does, who’s the joke on? Because it’s not on the LLM, which is indeed just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships.

This got me thinking about Kurt Gödel and his Numbering System as applied to LLM architecture with regards to patterns/tokens; these are axiomatic systems govern by simple rules woven together into a regression. So if this is the case, then this is an at least formal-like system and will be ultimately be Incomplete even if you account for the largest vocabulary/library of everything ever written (the totality of the Library of Babel from Jorge Borges comes to mind). So is this chase for AGI a fool’s errand if we can’t even prove AGI on a formal level? What does this say about us on a formal level? Maybe we can relate to this other ontological thing as a fellow confused pattern-recognizing being? Not equal but different. Regarding the replacement of journalists i believe that there are some of a kind who can be easily replaced by AI. Those whose work consists on following a script and who are so frequently and sadly found in MSM. AI can probably do it more reliably. In fact they probably use AI tools to write their articles. Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. I think it’s worth pointing out here that these GPUs go obsolete in 6-12 months, so their value drops sharply. Their collateral is like fresh fish. They have to hold on to it, but it will inevitably make a huge stink. It seems that with computer operating systems software (OS), the free & open source (FOSS) Linux has proven to be superior to non-FOSS/closed OS software like Windows. What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI? If no AI/LLM software is producing the hyped extreme productivity breakthroughs, wouldn’t there be an incentive globally in most nations to use or make limited propietary modifications on DeepSeek instead of the US closed software alternatives. Especially if it is the case that DeepSeek can provide similar quality models with 10% of Meta’s AI software’s computing power. Any computer scientists or financial analysts/economists focused on the InfoTech sector have a take on how a FOSS software like DeepSeek will influence future AI development? “What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI?” Sure thing bro, just search for “running deep seek on raspberry pi and you’ll get a long list of how to do it and many examples of it running. Raspberry is a very cheap one board computer that runs linux. https://www.hackster.io/ElecrowOfficial/how-to-run-deepseek-on-a-raspberry-pi-5-step-by-step-guide-c2c790 There’s a big difference between what FOSS can do and what it does do. Mostly the difference between what a motivated individual wants and what a pointy haired boss wants. ProNewerDeal claims Linux is superior (I agree, personally), but that hasn’t budged the needle on desktop market share, has it? Sure, you can shoehorn a LLM onto a Pi (it’ll run like molasses in January), but what CEO is going to boast about that to a quarterly analyst conference call? The CapEx orgy is hype driven, not performance driven (duh). This is an apples / oranges question. The real worry is that the current AI ‘productivity’ hype was a head fake to fund the infrastructure, and the real goal is to get everyone hooked on AI (a la Facebook/TicTok), dumb down the population, grab Google’s advertising money firehose and end up owning the mother of all Big Brother propaganda engines. I recently stumbled into some on-line drama about how the latest OpenAI model was messing with paying customer’s feels, by routing “dangerous or emotional” prompts to a safer model which was heavy on the warnings, and offering up information about self harm hotlines and such, rather than playing along like the previous model. Oh the humanity! I gather that paying customers can select the older model, but there’s real-time “psychological analysis” of your prompts so if it judges that you’re veering into dangerous territory, it routes to a newer, safer model. And let me tell you, THEY DONT LIKE IT! From my 30 minute climb down that rabbit hole, I came to the conclusion that there’s already a lot of people well on their way to the LLM addiction you mentioned in your last paragraph. It may not be plain jane FOSS, but Linux derivatives are being used by the biggest of big boys: Inside Google‘s Data Centers: The Operating Systems Powering Google‘s Global Infrastructure https://expertbeacon.com/inside-googles-data-centers-the-operating-systems-powering-googles-global-infrastructure/ Google‘s servers predominantly run customized versions of the open source Linux operating system that have been tuned and hardened for Google‘s unique technical environment. Rather than rely on standard “off-the-shelf” Linux distributions, Google‘s engineering team has modified and secured the Linux kernel and userspace tools to create server operating systems tailored for massive server fleets running containerized workloads. This journey to create a highly optimized server OS began nearly two decades ago and continues to evolve today. In Google‘s early days in the late 1990s, its initial fleet of servers ran a modified version of the Red Hat Linux distribution. However, as the scale and complexity of Google‘s infrastructure increased, its engineers began customizing the OS to meet its specific technical and operational needs. In 2006, Google started work on “goobuntu”, its own in-house distribution of the Debian-based Ubuntu Linux OS [1]. Goobuntu was used for Google‘s corporate desktops and also some of its production servers. For its larger server fleet, Google hardened and slimmed down the Linux distribution even further, removing extraneous packages and attack surfaces. This more spartan Linux system used an in-house software distribution and management tool called Midas. In the 2010s, Google began migrating servers to its latest generation custom Linux distribution known as gLinux [2]. The article also mentions that Linux derivatives are used by Amazon and Facebook. Admittedly, using a Pi for an LLM is probably not going to work too well, but AMD’s latest high end laptop CPUs are bringing some real heat if you want to do LLM at home: Linux on the New Framework Desktop PC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZDzrDI7AM That’s definitely NOT a cheap PC, but the LLM performance is pretty astonishing even at that price point. Overall though, I agree that AI is way, way over hyped for what it’s actually doing. But strangely, AI in other countries (at least one other country) is actually doing some pretty amazing stuff: China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 China is already a powerhouse in AI for radiology and medical imaging. Next they’re going global. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJlqhYt2XQ AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites, but it’s a dream that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Glen: AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites .. that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Yes. The trend is broadly recapitulating nuclear, which American capitalism — where corporate elites had to be served and profit before all else — also screwed up. Also, automobiles. Also, airliners (e.g. current Boeing failures). Don’t quote Silicon Valley at me, because that was built on Pentagon money; in 1960, 100 percent of all microprocessor chips it produced were bought by the DoD for ICBM guidance systems and early-warning radar networks like NORAD; as late as 1967, 75 percent of all chips from Silicon Valley were still going to the DoD. It took the Japanese to pioneer transistor/chip based electronic consumer appliances — computer tech for the civilian masses — not the Americans. Thanks for this excellent article. Indeed, the whole idea that LLMs are going to lead to AGI is just a laughable fantasy. Perhaps if Sam Altman hadn’t dropped out of a comp sci program, he might know this, but he’s from a rich family so he could always retreat back into money and vast carelessness. And then we get to the whole issue of data centers, their costs, the investment bubble, etc. Regarding the question about FOSS alternatives, and alternatives to the big data center apps… One of my colleagues has been experimenting with local LLMs. This colleague is a professional software engineer with decades of experience. Key findings about local LLMs: * Vision detection using an Intel Arc A770 (12GB of ram) works but gives many false positives. * Voice commands work only for the simplest commands. Anything beyond “turn on the kitchen light” fails to translate into expected actions. * Trying to write kubernetes YAML — the results are so terrible it’s just laughable. * Code generated in other languages “utter trash”. * Trying to resolve actual networking problems gives the same few suggestions, all of which were incorrect. * Trying to solve networking problems with cloud-based LLMs isn’t much better. * Using the app for an interactive diary, it got stuck in discussion loops after a few days. * Open source LLMs on Hugging Face are always well behind the commercial offerings from OpenAI et alia. Conclusion: currently-available local LLMs are simply not usable for many problems, or will cost too much to produce better results. From my vantage point, a lot of the hype around generative AI is being sustained by people who stumble through vibe coding a basic app and then say “wow, this is amazing — I wrote an app but I didn’t have to learn to code!” Basically, these are people looking for a free lunch. They want to be able to say “I wrote an app” but they don’t want to make the effort to learn a programming language. There are also those who say they want to learn, but in fact they are unwilling to just sit down and read a book. There are hundreds and hundreds of books about many different programming languages, expressly for this purpose. E.g., once upon a time, I read Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Language. It’s well-written and not very long. This is the tried and true way of doing it. But vibe coders don’t want to make such an effort. They want to “chat” with an AI to “learn” what they would get from simply reading a book. In other words, they want hold-holding and fawning attention from a sycophantic bot, all the way through. The unspoken premise here is that learning a programming language is some sort of insanely difficult task — but is it really? IMO, this leads us directly to a deeper issue, which is people who expect rewards — or actually feel entitled to those rewards — but don’t want to make any effort to get those rewards. What i found more damning is that while there are indeed applications for which de LLM models can be useful and help humans with some cumbersome tasks the big 7 keep focused on AGI. Interesting but boring business models bypassed in the search for some utopian or dystopian tech control of everything. The bubble is very, very high above us. And agreed: very good article. “…once upon a time, I read…” This is actually the key failing of AI. You read and comprehended something. LLM’s are given information to make statistically inferred outputs. They don’t read nor comprehend the information that was provided to them in training. I have some limited experience with local LLMs. It was like working with a 3 year old… but unlike a 3 year old, it never learned and kept making the same mistakes. Once in a while, I got better results without changing anything, and other times worse. Software engineer here. I can’t add much to this, unless the idea of AI code generation is to change my job from thinking about solutions to business concerns to thinking about editing the AI’s probabilistic solutions to business concerns, is the order of the day. Of course the there has been some big talk, but not many takers yet it seems. Amazon made hay over exactly this not long ago, as if the efficiency gains are something you can now take to the bank, and removed “tens of thousands” of workers from their rolls. But a few months later it turns out they just wanted to hire a bunch of H1b visa holders instead. Turns out AI ‘efficiency gains’ are simply wage cuts: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ “Those aren’t eatin’ sardines, their tradin’ sardines.” *they’re too early in the morning to try to be witty. sardine (n.) : “pilchard, type of small oily fish,” migratory and highly esteemed as a food, early 15c., from Latin sardina, sarda, from late Greek sardinē, sardinos, earlier sardē, which is often said to be from or related to Sardō “Sardinia” (see Sardinia), the Mediterranean island, near which the fish probably were caught and from which they were exported. which takes us back to the previous discussion of Sardonic Laughter. When i was in Cali i didn’t ask for pilchards but sardines and it was better understood by many sellers there. You know what happens with fish names: they are local and you have plenty of regional variations which apply to some similar fish species. If you enter “sardine” in fishbase you obtain 63 entries from many different regions representing more than two dozen species besides Sardina pilchardus. My wife has had a curious experience with AI-driven decisions taken in a Spanish bank. She was being charged some commissions on her account which according to bank rules were not applicable in this account. She went to a branch to get those removed and dis-charged. The person attending her agreed that she was right but when she tried, the AI algorithms didn’t allow to remove the commission because some obscure “original sin”, let’s call it this way, coming from the merger of the original bank where the account had been opened long ago. In the end this has been solved by a helping attendant who decided that the only way to do this was to deceive the algorithm with false data. You can imagine where is this all going when you have to resort to tricks. Sounds like a great way to have a crooked bank employee feed the AI algorithm some dodgy data so that bank funds are sent to an account that may not be “officially” listed. Would banks miss money going into a bank account that they cannot find listed in their files or even know about? That sounds a lot like the begging process that medical professionals face, with insurance company “care approval” protocols. There is no shortage of stories about doctors and patients trying to get timely care coverage. Insurers claim cost savings and better care, but charts suggest otherwise. There is a thingy about this on the Netflix show Barry and is in real life the Australian Robo Debt debacle – https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-04/robodebt-victims-get-compensation-from-class-action/105734030 I mean its not like there is some decades of these machinations in the “Market Place” and some are still confused … HR is old hat now lmmao … This is a tangent, but bear with me – it’s good and kinda relevant. The last link in the article is to a Science News Today article about building a “Dyson Sphere.” The article states: Dyson’s idea was born out of a need to conceptualize how an advanced civilization could continue to thrive as it consumed more and more energy. This is fake news (and a very common misconception). Freeman Dyson was making fun of the tortured logic used by SETI scientists to explain why they thought looking for particular radio waves would be a reasonable way to scan the stars for life. The article in which Dyson proposed the sphere was a one-page parody letter to an astro-physics journal. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t get dry humor (which is extremely obvious when you read the actual ‘paper’) and took him seriously. Dyson himself thought it was funny that he was best known for a joke he made instead of any of the actual physics he did. At any rate, the fact that a science news website is acting like Dyson Spheres make any sense at all (they don’t, and purposely so) is pretty indicative of where we’re at as a society…i.e. pretty far down the path to Idiocracy. So the guy bringing us GenAI talking about building Dyson Spheres is pretty on-brand. The best part of Altman’s quote got cut out in the article, however. Right after mentioning Dyson spheres, he says, “Like probably in the next 10 years or something.” roflmao. IBM TV ad on streaming: “Blue gonna help you transform your business with AI.” Reminds me of the TQM craze, everyone chased it no one read Deming! It’s doing wonders for their stock price, though. Victory! Why does this whole sorry episode remind me of the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel? It will all end in tears … As of last night, it finally dawned on me that I’ve been noticing what must be AI generated text in the description feeds to my Amazon Prime video account feeds. The first one I saw, but didn’t recognize it at the time as an AI hallucination, was a movie with the description that started something like, “Set in the 1920’s…”. However watching the trailer it was obvious the story was more modern, but the one item that probably threw me was there was one brief photo in the trailer that was older – maybe from the 1920’s. Anyhow I was confused enough by it that I just kept skipping it. Then last night I watch “The Healer”. It’s intro text started something like, “From the 17th century…” but again the trailer was all modern. I mentally just assumed the 17th century was a reference to a family history of healers which was part of the story line (that it was a family thing). However, after watching it there is NEVER any mention of anything from the 17th century. Then it dawned on me that it might be an AI hallucination. When I even went to the Amazon website the descriptive text there for “The Healer” never said anything about the 17th century, it was only in my Amazon Prime feed from the app on my Android TV. I am now certain my confusion over the “Set in the 1920’s” is also a hallucination. For all your readers who are interested in the history of AI’s coming into being in its current form Matteo Pasquinelli’s book, ‘The Eye of the Master: a social history of Artificial Intelligence’ is indepensable. It chartes the battles of the neuroscience sector, the interests of the US navy and Marxist analysis of labour power with formidable argument to demonstrate the deep flaws in AI’s claims to triumphant revolution. Well, with AI replacing labor, AI robotics replacing labor, AI replacing thinking … AI replacing….. with AI getting all the money to be productive while actual humans have income while that income is depleted more and more by out-go. You would think that fewer and fewer people will be able to afford the purchase or consumption of these magical AI fantasies. I guess if humans are to be digitized to the point of no choice, well then, AI will have all the biological imput devices for it’s consumption and outputs designed to maximize profits I am waiting for AI to come of age in law and take over for lawyers and judges. Between the constant stories of AI hallucinations re: legal case, and anecdotes about AIs learning to “cheat,” I can only imagine what sort of dystopic Wild West is coming for the court system… “The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use.” The disappointing performance of the COVID-19 vaccines raises doubts about Biomedicine’s ability to read and understand the scientific literature, which has demonstrated conclusively that durable immunity to coronaviruses is unattainable in vertebrates, either through previous infection or vaccination. Nevertheless, Operation Warp Speed was built on the premise that after everyone was vaccinated the pandemic would recede into nothingness. Cost was no object, and a few transnational Big Pharma corporations made tens of billions of dollars during 2021 and 2022, with the expectation of a continuing money stream after the initial surge in vaccinations. This approach was the only way forward and would lead to a revolution in rapid responses to future emerging infectious diseases using mRNA vaccines. And the scientists who figured out how to stabilize expression of exogenous mRNA in the target cells and tissues were awarded a Nobel Prize for their previously underappreciated research. Some calm reflection is in order. If all progress in AI development stopped cold today, it would take 20 years for its benefits to percolate through the world economy. Note that the productivity potential of networked computer technology and uniform electronic data standards available 20 years ago has still not been achieved, largely because of institutional behavioral inertia. The gating factor in the application of intelligence to the problems of man is not the pace of the synthesis of intelligence, it is the unwillingness of mankind to behave intelligently in accepting change. We know how to make universal medical charts and records. We know how to fully automate air traffic control. We know how to prevent train collisions. We know how to build trusted voting systems. But we are good at finding reasons for not doing the things we say we want to accomplish. Of course, when something becomes an “emergency,” suddenly the obvious is discovered. Welcome to the modern world: powered by emergencies, not emergent technologies. It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. — Niccolò Machiavelli This IS calm reflection, and not a moment too soon, in the face of too much cult-like marketing hype. Who is this “we” that will harness technology for the good of mankind? If recent history has shown us anything at all, it is that the application of new technologies—at least in the Western world—will be controlled by the most ruthlessly exploitive financial interests and used primarily if not exclusively to extract value from everyone else. This is the opposite of broadbased dissemination and learning that filters into quality improvements across sectors, raising living standards. My sister is a nurse. I’ve heard quite a bit about the rollout and aftermath of the EPIC medical management system. It is not designed to help medical providers or improve patient care. It’s about billing, full stop, and it’s hated by pretty much everyone she knows in her field. “We know how to make universal medical charts and records.” Yes, we do. And they have very little to do with improving healthcare and everything to do with billing and upcoding. No single $8-ibuprofen tablet shall remain unaccounted for! It is also true that AI transcribed charts are often replete with mistranslations and outright hallucinations. It is a sad fact that U.S. hospitals have effectively resisted the automation and interoperability of their systems for decades. Medical professionals have insisted on preserving institutional moats and drawbridges that render their computer systems highly incompatible, despite the obvious need to track the same patient information. There is no digital standard for the patient chart, the most basic medical record. Between 5 to 10 percent of patients are harmed by medical error. Surely uniform AI cross checks on diagnosis and treatment would reduce that. Put on top of this a health insurance structure that only M.C. Escher could depict, and you have an inefficient mess attributable not to evil computer geniuses, but to institutional turf wars, perverse incentives, and just plain cussedness. It’s not just medical institutions. Look at the power grid, the rail system, pipeline infrastructure, and air traffic control. Look at the inability to build housing, the plague of homeless mentally ill people, all in a nation that is among the richest in the world. Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem? Is misguided technology speculation [that will probably crash a debt-ridden economy] really a central problem? It sounds bad to me… Private Debt mate “Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem?” It’s certainly not the solution. Most of this is due to the category error that his health insurance. People insure their lives and property against events that are unlikely. Illness and accident are not in this category. No argument from me that if healthcare were the objective instead of private profit (even in “nonprofit” hospitals), interoperability and legitimate electronic health records could be useful and universal and improve healthcare all around. According to STAT yesterday, UpToDate is unveiling its AI version. UpToDate has become the near universal cheat sheet for clinicians. Still, from the article: That kind of explainability is critical as doctors choose when and how to let different AI tools help them, said Crowe. But healthcare AI experts emphasized that those advances have not eliminated the chance for error through hallucinations, omissions, or other more nuanced LLM mistakes. Stanford’s Chen cited an example in which a resident had treated a patient with severe alcohol withdrawal with phenobarbital, a powerful sedative and anticonvulsant, based on an LLM-based tool’s response. Chen asked the AI the same question, and got the response he expected: First line therapy was safer benzodiazepines, followed by phenobarbital. “AI will just make up some stuff — or even if it doesn’t make up stuff, it’s a little bit random,” he said. “This unpredictability is what allows it to be kind of creative and flexible. But do you want to be creative when you’re practicing medicine?” Some clinical generative AI tools may perform better than others — depending on their engineering, the data they’re trained on, or their underlying LLMs. There are tradeoffs involved in choosing any subset of medical material to train on. “You are potentially missing some important information if you’re not pulling from more up-to-date resources,” said physician Cornelius James, who researches AI and evidence-based medicine at the University of Michigan. “But you also avoid bias in that you’re not pulling from some of those more up-to-date resources.” But clinicians are missing the details needed to make informed choices between tools. “The general state of the evidence is terrible,” said neurosurgeon Eric Oermann, who directs the Health AI Research Lab at NYU Langone. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. Benchmarks are imperfect, said Oermann, but at least they allow for researchers to compare large language models from tech companies like Google and OpenAI on a level playing field by peppering their APIs with thousands of programmed questions. Anyway, I do not think it unreasonable to expect a resident physician to know that benzodiazepines are the preferred choice over phenobarbital for a patient suffering from alcohol withdrawal, which is not a particularly rare condition. It has been said millions times that “being educated means knowing where to look up something.” No, being educated means knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. GingerBalls on the Twitter often points out that there’s an unintelligent solution to every intelligence test, so passing these licensing exams is meaningless. Participation in the technical aspects of this discussion, which I am reading with great interest, is above my pay grade, but an observation: the medical and pharmaceutical professions, at least in Canada, are currently the sole remaining market for fax machines. You clearly have not been paying attention to our decade+ posting, based on the work of medical professionals who happen to be experts in IT, as well as the experience of users, that electronic health records are an utter train wreck. And it has NADA to do with your bogus depiction. The process has been driven by billing and the desire to upcode. Not medical care. Not ever remotely your fabricated “medical professionals preserving institutional moats’. You need to stop Making Shit Up when you do not know what you are talking about. Agree with everything here except timing. Some economists tried to quantify the technology diffusion rate and found it’s closer to fifty years instead of twenty if you’re looking at full global adoption. Smartphones took over the world and changed our brains in less than ten years, on the other hand. But yes, there are still Homo sap tribes living in the Amazon who don’t know the world outside their forest and are living the way they lived in 20,000 years (though not in the Americas). Personally, I think it’ll be a sad day if and when they cease to be there — because the world is coming for them — though I wouldn’t wish to be one of them. “Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” … Perfect. Re: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last? By Servaas Storm Proper descriptive language is critical to the analysis and reworking of human systems. Therefore, being lulled into repeating truisms that are not true undermines the work being undertaken. In the article, Storm says, “The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels.” That phrase is not true. Eliminating “workers and” corrects the statement, ironically, by doing exactly what makes AI so attractive to “firms.” The idea that automation makes the residual workforce more productive has always been a lie, a lie that has been encouraged by ownership simply because it has some ability to make that residual workforce proud of the machines that make it “the most productive workforce in human history,” even as the latest machines pick off the remaining laborers, one by one. Dividing amount of production by number of laborers to get ever-rising labor productivity figures is a stupid accounting trick. Dividing production by labor equivalent units (LEU’s – and, yes, this is adapted from containerized shipping) gives away the game. By not defining or measuring LEU’s, it veils the possibility that productivity – given that energy and pollution would necessarily be figured into the cost of each LEU – would be revealed as having heretofore invisible periods of stagnation, even regression. More importantly, defining and measuring LEU’s would eliminate any last trace of simplistically attributing productivity to labor. By dividing measured production between labor and LEU’s, it would make stark the reality that ownership always trumps attribution. Attributed productivity has never given more than a tenuous claim to the profits of production. Labor has always known that. Labor has long been able to project the trend of increasing productivity and has long dreaded that projection: that eventually “labor” would be reduced to a janitor cleaning up after the machines, working for minimum wage, while being attributed trillions in productivity. Ownership matters. Once nourishment and a safe place to live is secured, ideas are the most valuable commodities, yet “intellectual property” is almost an oxymoron. Technique ends up embedded in tools. That is why, where the guilds were strong, possessing the tools of a craftsman, without being a member of the appropriate guild might actually be a crime. Similarly, the Luddites were not so much opposed to advances in technology as they were the embedding of their intellectual property into an array of machines. Truly, the machinists were the first computer programers, and they feasted on converting the deep skills of others into own-able hardware. Now, the programmers are coming for the artists, the scientists, even the C-suites, and the latest generation of programmers might be the last, as intellectual property devours its producers, and is left to eat its own tail. But the last programmer will be attributed a vast productivity. “Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” That’s some Chinese characteristics that I endorse. The USA business and financial sector is preoccupied with trying to insert rent-seeking middle-men between all the issues that could be addressed now – for and by people in the here and now. The people who have to be healthy, sane, and safe in order to have healthy, sane, and safe people in the future. It’s still just fucking software! What a con! If you are interested in a detailed outline of the progress of AI in the MIC, here is a great substack that explains what is going on in the field where military combat AI is being developed. It focuses on Arizona and New Mexico because the largest combat military training centers in the world are located there. I foresee a great future for AI as the military has unlimited financing for the large corporations dabbing in that field. https://sonoransown.substack.com/p/life-recast I guess this is the terminal phase of the AI bubble, the phase I remember from the dotcom one – if you mention the risks that were mounting by the hour people would yell at you because the objective was to get funding and walk away with all you could in the crash. And in five years somebody buys the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar and turns a profit on porn or whatever. Only a tiny example of odd experience: I was testing duck.ai as my system is too old to host the new programs. I wanted duck.ai to shorten a narrative text by 10, then 20, then 50%. For some internal error it cut it down by 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. This failure repeated. It never came up with versions which would be 10% shorter or 20% than what I had fed it with. Strange. Generally the results with narrative fiction are horrible. What the system is offering (they claim to treat the texts confidential) is either total nonsense or equipped with some sense but solely by coincidence. Containing meaning that has little to do with what I had originally written. This is especially true – and now any programmer should seriously lsiten up – humour or “poetical” formulations. Style in general is overwhelming it. Anything where “tonality” comes into play crashes it . As I said I can´t judge state of the art systems. But unless I tell any AI to reproduce something in the style of say TS Eliot, or Dickens or Austen, it doesn´t know wha to do. It is totally lost and will fail to develope inherent styles of its own. And produce gibberish. Which shouldn´t surprise. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers rebelled against the machines. They intuited that if they did not own the machines, the machines would own them. This is also the case with robotics in production, “Who owns the robots?” AI in my thinking is no more than a language and data collecting robot. So, “who owns AI?” We see that financialization and rent-seeking have turned AI research into a mess. By all accounts, researchers in China do not do the same. #DotComBoomBustMemories I had a video chat with one of my younger colleagues at work, and they asked me what similarities if any I see between the dot-com-boom, and this new AI-boom. At first, I thought that the dot-com-boom was really more intense flying-by-the-seat-of-ones-pants-into-the-unknown … but as we talked through it, I realized, that this is potentially far worse. The lemmings from lower Manhattan and the sycophants from the valley of silicon are getting the band back together! Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. Once again, the odious runaway sewage train (via YouTube) of unicorn valuations looks set to derail and spill sh** everywhere. When the colo-business (via dgtlinfra.com) collapsed after the dot-com-bust, a lot of data-center space in NY/NJ, for example, reverted to office space. The intervening years brought public-cloud to the fore, and now public cloud space is set to expand just like metro datacenter space expanded at the turn of the century. One can only imagine the impact of large AI-specific datacenters being built out in the boonies (where land/tax, water and power are cheaper, ostensibly) only to have them decommissioned and empty when the bust invariably comes. Empty strip mall desert redux, anyone? One of the reasons the tech-bros are focused on “surpassing human intelligence” is because they absolutely loathe labor. The finance bros may seem convinced about AI, but they’re not fully. They want two things: • Proof that AI can generate new revenue streams – this, they have gotten thus far. • Proof that AI can kill jobs – this, they haven’t got (to a satisfactory degree yet), and I think this is what they really, really want. The dumb asses don’t understand how an economy works at all, and are blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. So, yeah … bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! And if, by some chance, this edifice of irrational exuberance somehow manages to survive, just remember: AI is gonna replace everyone … except VC’s … #natch (via futurism.com). Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. > I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. Thanks much for the confirmation! I know these types, but don’t share environs often. Sadly, the article did NOT look at AI in China – but was navel-focused. China AI is primarily focused on the factory, where it actually provides quantifiable cost savings. The US AI has been focused on rendering a larger fraction of the population as inessential workers – to use the language of Bender in Futurama – meatbags – consistent with the disdain the oligarchs have for the lumpen population.

Title: 'No excuse' as to why Spiritan redress scheme not started
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/1003/1536582-spiritans-redress/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T06:00:00Z

Ailbhe Conneely Social Affairs & Religion Correspondent The Spiritan Order has been accused of further traumatising victims and survivors of child sex abuse, by failing to implement the Independent Restorative Justice Framework it announced three years ago. The advocacy group Restore Together which represents many of victims/survivors of Dublin's Blackrock College and Willow Park School, Rockwell College, St Mary's College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, has pointed to a lack of urgency by the order in completing the programme. The Spiritan Restorative Justice Framework has six elements including an apology, therapy, testimony (truth telling), redress, memorialisation and restorative justice. Just half of those have been activated in full according to Restore Together. The redress scheme and the truth searching process - to help the Spiritans and Irish society learn from the abuse scandal - has yet to be agreed and started. The last element (physical and other forms of memorialisation at Spiritan schools), will not be implemented until the other elements are activated and progressed. The restorative framework, which is independently managed, has the potential to be a ground-breaking development in Irish social justice if fully implemented, according to the group. It has described it as "progressively designed" to address the traumas of abuse in a holistic, collaborative and non-adversarial manner, to help people to heal and get justice, and to rebalance the power between victim and perpetrator. In a statement it said there was "no excuse" for not having all six elements implemented by now. Spokesperson Philip Freddis said the group "can't get a meeting" to discuss the status of the redress scheme and the other elements of the framework. He pointed out that those suffering are mainly in their 60s or older, "so we are deep into overtime". In June, the order said it realised that time was of the essence for those awaiting an announcement of a redress scheme. It acknowledged that the pace of putting the necessary framework for "overhauling and restructuring the assets of the Province" had been slow. It expressed hope that "a more detailed update of progress" would be issued by the end of the summer. Mr Freddis said the full Restorative Justice Framework "must be delivered in a timely way" or its benefit would be "diluted or even lost" if people had to wait and fight for every element of it. "Why after all these years, is there a lack of urgency and why must we be made to appeal, plead, fight and ultimately wait for justice like this? "We can only conclude that there is a lack of understanding, empathy and prioritisation by the Spiritans for their victims/survivors," he said.

Blackrock College in Dublin. Photo: Brian Lawless/PA Victims and survivors of child sex abuse at Spiritan schools are suffering “further trauma” due to ongoing delays in the delivery of a redress scheme, an advocacy group has said. The Spiritan schools involved are Blackrock College and Willow Park School, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The advocacy group Restore Together has said there is a “lack of urgency” in the setting up of an agreed redress scheme. Restore Together spokesperson Philip Feddis said the group was told in June that it would have an update by the end of the summer, but has not been able to hold a meeting to discuss the status of the redress scheme or other elements of a restorative framework. "We were told in June that we would have an update by the end of the summer, but currently we cannot even get a meeting to discuss the status of the Redress Scheme and the other elements of the Restorative Justice Framework that was announced no less than three years ago,” he said. "It is not acceptable to victims/survivors because justice delayed is justice denied. Blackrock College in Dublin. Photo: Brian Lawless/PA Today's News in 90 Seconds - October 3rd “It is over four years since we first engaged with the Spiritans on this scandal. The people suffering are mainly in their 60s or older, so we are deep into overtime. "The full Restorative Justice Framework must be delivered in a timely way or its benefit will be diluted or even lost if people are made to wait and fight for every element of it.” A restorative framework was first announced by the Spiritans in 2022, and according to Restore Together would be a “groundbreaking development in Irish social justice” if fully implemented. "Restore Together say there is no excuse for not having all six elements of the programme implemented by now considering it is decades after children were abused, over four years since Restore Together first met the Spiritans and three years since the Restorative Justice Framework itself was announced,” the group said in a statement. It said the delivery of a redress scheme, instead of individuals having to go to court, is a “particularly important element” of the promised programme, and just three of the six elements of the programme have been implemented. These elements include apology, therapy and counselling, and restorative justice services. Along with the redress scheme, Restore Together said a truth searching and gathering process is yet to be agreed, which would help the Spiritans and Irish society “learn from the abuse scandal”. The last element, physical and other forms of memorialisation at Spiritan schools, will not be implemented until the other five elements have been progressed. “There is no argument about the need to address the wrongs that continue to harm us or how it should be done,” Mr Feddis said. “So why, after all these years, is there a lack of urgency and why must we be made to appeal, plead, fight and ultimately wait for justice like this? We can only conclude that there is a lack of understanding, empathy and prioritisation by the Spiritans for their victims/survivors.” The Spiritans have been contacted for comment.

Title: Hyperliquid Still Best-Positioned Perp DEX Despite Aster’s Surge, DeFi Analyst Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/03/hyperliquid-still-best-positioned-perp-dex-despite-aster-s-surge-defi-analyst-says
Time Published: 2025-10-03T04:20:33Z
Full Content:
A new thesis from DeFi analyst Patrick Scott argues that despite losing market share to rivals, Hyperliquid remains the most investable decentralized exchange for perpetual futures. Perpetual futures — or perps — are crypto derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices without an expiry date. The decentralized platforms that host them, known as perp DEXes, have surged in popularity as traders move activity away from centralized exchanges (CEXes) such as Binance. Scott noted that perp DEXes have expanded from less than 2% of CEX perpetual trading volume in 2022 to more than 20% last month. Hyperliquid, which issues the HYPE token, has been a key driver of that growth. Still, recent shifts have raised questions. Hyperliquid’s share of perp DEX volume fell from 45% to just 8% in recent weeks, while Binance-affiliated rival Aster ballooned to more than $270 billion in weekly trades. Other upstarts such as Lighter and edgeX also posted triple-digit percentage gains in activity. Scott argued that Hyperliquid’s fundamentals set it apart. The exchange continues to generate strong revenue, trading at what he described as a reasonable multiple compared to peers, with user stickiness reflected in open interest. “Unlike volume and revenue, which measure activity, open interest measures liquidity. It’s much stickier,” he wrote, noting Hyperliquid still commands about 62% of the perp DEX open interest market. Beyond trading, Scott highlighted expansion plans including the HyperEVM network, already hosting over 100 protocols and $2 billion in total value locked and USDH, a stablecoin backed by reserves held with BlackRock and Superstate. Another initiative, HIP-3, would allow builders to launch new perps markets by staking large amounts of HYPE, creating what Scott described as a “supply sink” for the token. Scott cautioned that his thesis would be invalidated if Hyperliquid’s open interest or revenue dropped materially, or if USDH failed to gain liquidity over the next year. But for now, he maintains Hyperliquid is better positioned than competitors running heavy incentive programs.

Title: Saudi considers removing foreign investor restrictions on stocks
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/10/03/2025/saudi-considers-removing-foreign-investor-restrictions-on-stocks

Saudi Arabia is preparing to lift restrictions on foreign investors buying local stocks, in the latest step by regulators to boost trading on the Tadawul exchange. The Capital Market Authority (CMA) launched a 30-day consultation on rules that, if approved, would scrap the so-called Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) program, which forces international investors to meet certain criteria before they can trade. The proposal would also eliminate a swap program used by foreigners to access the market indirectly. The CMA said the move was part of a âgradual approach to opening the marketâ designed to attract âgreater flows of foreign capital.â It hinted that further measures would follow to increase international participation. In this article: Following on from moves announced last week, removing the QFI program signals that Saudi Arabia is getting serious about taking steps to attract foreign cash, even if the latest announcement sparked some confusion. The QFI program was introduced a decade ago as the kingdomâs first step to open its exchange to global money, initially requiring participants to have at least $5 billion of assets under management. At the time, regulators worried about an influx of âhot moneyâ entering and exiting quickly. No longer. Criteria have been eased several times since then as the kingdom increasingly sees the need to court foreign capital. Saudi Arabia has a big pipeline of companies planning to list on the stock market, many with government ownership. To digest all this new supply of shares the market will need to attract as many investors as possible. That should also help boost liquidity. Low volumes of trading has been a common bugbear for foreign investors looking at investing in Tadawul. There are now around 4,500 registered QFIs on the Saudi exchange, including some of the worldâs biggest fund managers: including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan Asset Management. Once the latest amendments to the rules are finalized anyone around the world will be able to quickly start investing in the Saudi market. Some investors were confused that the draft rules published Wednesday evening still contained references to a foreign ownership cap that was set to be amended. Dumping the QFI regime is the start. Next would be changes to foreign ownership limits, which are currently capped at 49%, two people familiar with the plans said. The CMA is reportedly working on a proposal to adjust that cap, though currently foreigners hold only about 11% of the market and no single stock is anywhere near the limit. Market reaction to the QFI consultation was muted, in contrast to the buying spree triggered by potential lifting of foreign ownership limits. But that was probably overdone. Saudi companies will still need to demonstrate strong earnings growth amid a public sector showing signs of slower spending if they are to truly attract more foreign capital.

Title: Meta Superintelligence Labs executives are pushing staff to ditch slow internal systems for faster engineering tools

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is trying to speed up AI development by steering its teams toward new tools that allow developers to build and test products more quickly, according to internal memos obtained by Business Insider. The shift highlights the stakes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's massive bet on AI. Over the past year, Meta has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into luring top researchers with nine-figure pay packages and reorganized its AI work under the new Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Now, its new leaders are revamping the internal engineering tools that those teams use — a shift that underscores the urgency with which Meta is moving as it races to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Internal documents show that MSL's Product and Applied Research (PAR) group, led by former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, is pushing staff away from Meta's slower, home-grown infrastructure toward mainstream developer platforms like Vercel. One memo from late September notes that Meta's existing systems, designed for billions of users and giant engineering teams, take "too long" to deploy changes and are "not conducive to vibe coding," making it harder for small, fast-moving AI teams to experiment. The practice of vibe coding, or having AI tools write code, is becoming more widespread among engineers in the tech industry. Meanwhile, Meta is also building an internal alternative called "Nest" that will integrate more easily with Meta's data for quick experimentation. Another internal post shows that Meta has paired Vercel with GitHub, a widely used code-hosting and collaboration platform owned by Microsoft, to give its PAR teams a faster way to work. Friedman and Alexandr Wang, Meta's new chief AI officer, are investors in Vercel. Vercel has become one of the biggest names in the market for building web and AI apps. In September, it raised $300 million at a $9.3 billion valuation from backers including Accel, Singapore's GIC, BlackRock, Khosla Ventures, and General Catalyst. The company's customers include giants like Netflix, Adobe, and Stripe. The memos offer a rare glimpse into how Meta is trying to accelerate its AI ambitions by relying on outside development and engineering tools, and sidestepping the limitations of its own systems that were built for a different era. Meta declined to comment. Vercel and GitHub did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. In one of the memos sent in late September, Aparna Ramani, head of infrastructure for MSL, told staff that the company's internal systems, which were built to support billions of users and massive teams of developers, don't work well for the small, fast-moving engineering teams inside PAR. "Deploying changes takes too long (hours vs. minutes), and the overall tech stack is not conducive to vibe coding," Ramani wrote. In other words, engineering tasks that would be quick and easy to deploy elsewhere often require more manual work at Meta, slowing teams down. Ramani's memo outlines a plan with two approaches to quickly build app prototypes and reduce deployment times from 99 minutes to two minutes or less. The first approach uses Vercel, which, Ramani wrote, is "widely used and can unblock MSL immediately." She wrote that Vercel is willing to work with Meta to mitigate some data and hosting restrictions. Ramani also wrote that Meta already has one tool running on Vercel, with multiple other projects in development. The second approach is to build an internal platform called "Nest" for hosting apps built with TypeScript — a popular Microsoft-created programming language widely used across the industry — on Meta's systems. Ramani wrote that a working prototype was expected within two weeks of the memo. Nest will eventually become the "de facto" option, and keeping Vercel available provides "an escape valve where there are capability gaps," the memo said. A second internal memo, published on September 17, shows how Meta used Vercel with GitHub to provide its PAR teams with a faster way to build and prototype apps. Meta is already running 10 projects on Vercel and GitHub, which could now be updated "in minutes," the post said. Meta has often turned to outside technology when its own tools fall short. Earlier this year, Business Insider reported that Meta rolled out an internal coding assistant called Devmate that uses AI models from rivals, including Anthropic's Claude, after employees said Meta's own Llama AI model struggled with complex tasks. Meta has also recently launched a feature called Vibes, which uses Midjourney, an external AI image generator, rather than its own image-generation technology. Friedman is an advisor to Midjourney.

According to a Bloomberg report, the secondary sale lets current and former staff who had held shares for at least two years sell stock to a handful of companies, including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The deal marks OpenAI’s second major tender offer in under a year, following a $1.5 billion SoftBank transaction last November. In January, the Japanese conglomerate was reportedly in talks to earmark up to $25 billion for OpenAI. SoftBank’s U.S.-traded shares (SFTBY) rose 1.7% to $66.04 on Thursday after news of the OpenAI share sale, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its AI-linked deals. The $500 billion figure reflects a steep rise for OpenAI from earlier in the year, when the ChatGPT developer was valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by Softbank in March. With this latest move, the company now sits ahead of SpaceX—whose own valuation is estimated near $400 billion—putting OpenAI at the top of the private company universe. Despite scrutiny around the rollout of GPT-5, investor confidence remains undimmed. In September, OpenAI and Nvidia unveiled a strategic infrastructure partnership: OpenAI plans to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed. Jensen Huang described it as part of “bringing AI infrastructure from the labs into the world.” It also coincides with the ongoing Stargate partnership between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle to build out America’s AI infrastructure backed by the Trump Administration. The sale also gives employees liquidity that could help the company fend off nine-figure pay packages from rivals such as Meta, which is aggressively hiring for its new Superintelligence Labs. The timing also coincides with structural moves at OpenAI. The company lifted its capped-profit limit in May, all the while facing continued legal pressure from Elon Musk. An OpenAI co-founder, Musk has sued the company on multiple occasions. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission and allegedly attempting to steal xAI data and trade secrets.

Title: OpenAI now worth $500 billion, possibly making it the world's most valuable startup

OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. Fukui is a coastal prefecture easily accessible from Tokyo; away from crowds and tourists, but with plenty to do, see and taste. So the investors really still have any expectations? LOL This article is pure hype. ChatGPT is currently losing between $13 million and $23 million per day, depending on how costs are calculated, reflecting operating losses of roughly $400 million to $700 million per month in the second half of 2025. These figures are from several financial reports and news articles published just recently. OpenAI disclosed to shareholders and international media that it lost $2.5 billion in the first half of 2025, mostly due to R&D and operational costs for running ChatGPT on a global scale. This equates to approximately $400 million per month, or about $13 million per day, with other estimates for ongoing all-in costs reaching higher daily figures based on infrastructure, energy, and training expenditures. ChatGPT's unveiling of version 5 was a serious flop, and many users reverted to older models. The new model design and infrastructure changes obviously reflect an attempt to balance costs but at the expense of 'intelligence'. Claude by Anthropic is now preferred by most serious users, and Perplexity is favored for research. ChatGPT's research now lacks the depth, scope, and accuracy of its competitors by a significant margin. OpenAI on a standalone business basis might not be that valuable, but it turns out they have a vast amount of business partnership opportunities, $synergies which are highly unique and thus in the minds of many highly knowledgeable investors, justifying the $valuation Only time will tell, but their chances seem solid, as their scale and biz model flexibility in AI is hard to $achieve Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Title: ‘I don’t know why I need to go to college’: Ford CEO says his Gen Z son worked as a mechanic and wondered if the 4-year degree was still worth it
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/jim-farley-says-gen-z-son-worked-as-mechanic-college-degree/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T21:28:22Z
Full Content:
Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Ford CEO Jim Farley gathered a host of experts this week to discuss what he calls “the essential economy,” the blue-collar backbone that he sees mired in crisis. AT&T CEO John Stankey and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam talked about how AI is impacting manufacturing and how they’re hustling to stay ahead of the curve; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a sober warning about how China could “dominate” if we’re not careful with our auto industry; and even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon appeared via video to urge America not to become a “nation of compliance and box-checking.” But during the keynote discussion with Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Mike Rowe of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation, Farley revealed how his own family is being impacted. “My son worked as a mechanic this summer,” Farley said while moderating. Then, Farley added, his son said something that stunned both of his parents: “Dad, I really like this work. I don’t know why I need to go to college.” Farley said he and his wife looked at each other and wondered, “Should we be debating this?” It’s something that’s happening in a lot of American households, he noted. “It should be a debate.” Rowe, a longtime vocational advocate, seized on data showing that while two skilled tradespeople enter the workforce, five retire each year. The imbalance, he explained, is “the math that’s catching up to us” as the baby boomer generation ages and birth rates fall. Rowe cited data from his own life. His own degree cost $12,200 in 1984, he said, whereas today it would cost something like $97,000. “Nothing in the history of Western civilization has gotten more expensive, more quickly,” Rowe said. “Not energy, not food, not real estate, not even health care, [nothing has been inflated more] than the cost of a four-year degree.” The Associated Press reported that, yes, many colleges were charging roughly $95,000 per year as of April 2024, but the financial aid system lowers that in practice. Still, it’s by and large true that inflation for college tuition, health care, and housing costs has far outpaced that for, say, televisions, toys, and software, showing Rowe is making a solid point. With costs this high, the value proposition of college is under serious scrutiny. Fortune has reported on several Gen Z entrepreneurs who dove straight into the trades instead of going to college. One, at 23, was already his own boss and making more than $100,000 per year, and the other, 19, was working his way up to it. Both of them had side hustles as social-media influencers, adding another revenue stream. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, said she often gives options to students that are different from a traditional four-year degree. “Our youth want to know why. Why do I need to go to college? Why do I want to get in debt? Why do I want to do these things?” She said that “because I told you so” doesn’t cut it anymore. Labor Secretary Chavez-DeRemer echoed this sentiment, saying government, educators, and industry must partner to make the skilled trades attractive to young Americans. “For far too long, we haven’t brought the right people to the table,” she said, emphasizing the need for collaboration so that “businesses are heard, and the American workforce is valued.” Chavez-DeRemer argued that if the average American wants to have a good-paying job and a mortgage, they should strongly consider the trades. She questioned: “Do you know that most of our 35- and 40-year-olds are not going to be able to buy a home anywhere near the future?” This is the time in people’s lives when they’re trying to grow their families, and the current U.S. economy does not set them up to do that, she said. She noted that trade school graduates often emerge earning more than $100,000 per year. The average tradesman will come out making about $11,000 more than a college graduate will, she said. The essential obstacle, said Rowe, is not just economics but stigma. “Stigmas and stereotypes and myths and misperceptions have conspired to keep a whole generation of kids from giving trades an honest look,” he said. Until the culture changes and people recognize the dignity and opportunity of these jobs, attempts to fill workforce gaps will be “quixotic or Sisyphean.” Asked about the fear AI and robotics might replace human workers, both panelists were optimistic. Chavez-DeRemer compared the transition to prior industrial and tech revolutions, stating: “We adapt. We are an adaptable people.” She emphasized AI should be seen as a tool that empowers, not replaces, the essential workforce. “Businesses are retraining their employees,” she said. “The R&D is showing us that [they’re] going to create new types of jobs.” Rowe added, “AI is coming for the coders, not yet for the welders,” reflecting the resiliency and growing demand in the trades. He argued every “frontline” vocation, from welding to pipe-fitting, is now seeing a boom, and AI won’t touch that. Rowe also cited remarks covered by Fortune from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about the need for blue-collar workers to power the data-center infrastructure underlying the AI boom. He also mentioned BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s comments that his $12 trillion–plus portfolio was dependent on having enough electricians, a sector short of hundreds of thousands of workers. “The biggest CEOs in our country [are ringing] the metaphorical alarm bell,” Rowe said, calling it a “macro problem” the essential economy can solve. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: IBIT Surpasses Deribit to Become Largest Bitcoin Options Platform

Written & Edited byLandon Manning BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is currently the largest venue for BTC options trading, reaching a whopping $38 billion in open interest. The product surpassed Deribit, a derivatives exchange owned by Coinbase, to achieve this goal. This record could serve as a bullish data point for crypto ETFs, as IBIT was better-equipped to deal with setbacks last month. Still, in the long run, a TradFi takeover could cut into crypto margins. With Bitcoin options traders preparing for Uptober, it’s important to remember just how huge this market really is. Four months ago, Coinbase agreed to a $2.9 billion deal to purchase Deribit, the popular derivatives exchange, and the firm’s stock rose 37% during the negotiations. Last month, Coinbase completed this deal to make bold expansions in the Bitcoin and crypto options markets. However, the BTC ETFs are apparently even more popular than this platform, with BlackRock’s IBIT reaching a mesmerizing $38 billion in open interest: $IBIT has surpassed Coinbase's Derbit platform as the largest venue for bitcoin options with $38b in open interest. I told y'all ETFs are no joke.. Fat crypto margins in trouble. Nice find by @sidharth_shukla pic.twitter.com/LUcnpW5g4I Experts already called IBIT the “greatest launch in ETF history,” but this really puts the asset’s prominence in perspective. Even while Bitcoin ETFs saw institutional outflows and deflated gains in September, this single product has still come to dominate the options market. To be fair, the graph clearly shows that Deribit’s open interest fell sharply in the last few days, which is an important component of this crossover. A record-breaking $21 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expired last week, creating a huge stress-test for derivatives exchanges. Still, this evidently wasn’t a comparable problem for ETFs. This data point is a handy piece of evidence supporting ETFs’ growing stature. Both IBIT and Deribit faced important setbacks last month, but the ETF has apparently weathered them more effectively. Considering that a flood of altcoin ETFs may hit the markets after the US government shutdown ends, this could be very useful information. Regardless of which venue is more successful, this high open interest for Bitcoin options trading is a bullish signal. While BTC’s price continues to rise, the markets show a diversified appetite. Still, there might be some potential downsides to this approach. As TradFi institutions like BlackRock become the preferred vehicles for Bitcoin options trading, it may become harder to achieve the same rapid price gains that crypto is famous for.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Buffett's Berkshire Buys; Fair Isaac Soars, Equifax Falls

Shares of a data analytics firm took off after the company said it would provide its consumer credit scores directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage lenders. The move pressured the credit bureaus that also evaluate potential borrowers. Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher Thursday. Outperformance from materials and technology stocks offset declines in most sectors as investors continued to weigh the implications of a government shutdown. The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%, while the Dow and the Nasdaq were up 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. See here to read Investopedia's full coverage of the day's trading. Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) confirmed a nearly $10 billion deal to acquire the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum (OXY). The transaction marks Berkshire's largest deal since 2022. Shares of Occidental Petroleum fell 7.3%, while Berkshire Hathaway shares posted fractional losses. Fair Isaac (FICO) shares surged 18%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after the data analytics company said it would offer its FICO consumer credit scores directly to firms that sell consolidated credit reports to mortgage providers. The data provider said the move would reduce the reliance on the three nationwide credit bureaus, and shares of the credit bureaus moved lower. Equifax (EFX) shares were down 8.5%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock, while TransUnion (TRU) shares dropped nearly 11%. The prices of bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other major cryptocurrencies extended their recent revival. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, jumped 7.5%, while of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which also offers crypto trading, added 4.1%. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev at a conference predicted that the "tokenization" of real-world assets, including stocks, would have a major impact on global financial markets. Intel (INTC) shares gained 3.8% in the wake of recent reports that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in early talks to become a customer of Intel's foundry business. Intel stock has doubled in value since reaching its year-to-date low in April, boosted by a series of high-profile investments from Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank (SFTBY), and the U.S. government. Shares of the renewable energy provider AES Corp. (AES) sank 7%. The downturn reversed some of the gains posted in the previous session amid reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by BlackRock (BLK), was in advanced negotiations about a potential acquisition of AES, which has signed deals with several tech firms to power artificial intelligence data centers.

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) capitalized on Wall Street’s artificial intelligence boom Thursday, fueled by billions in chip investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and other technology giants. Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market. While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers. Also Read: Broadcom Wins $10 Billion OpenAI Order, Analyst Sees More Growth Ahead This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips. By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution. KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain. Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply. Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted. A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double. Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production. Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS).

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Meta is continuing to build AI for advertisers. Its latest AI agent and several new tools are designed to serve as an automated online sales assistant and personalization feature for small- to medium-sized businesses, even outside of Facebook and other Meta platforms. Also: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude At the same time, the company will start using your chats with Meta AI to personalize the ads you see on Meta platforms. The company's new Business AI agent can provide online shoppers with basic customer support and product recommendations on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. The goal is to quicken the process between customers discovering a new product and completing a purchase, while simultaneously freeing businesses up to focus their attention on more pressing tasks. Leading tech companies have been investing heavily in business-facing AI agents, promoting them as a simple and effective way to automate busywork. Like many other agents, Business AI specializes in analyzing and integrating with the context of the business deploying it; the system automatically assesses a brand's preexisting online presence to modify its outputs. Also: How autonomous businesses succeed by engaging with the world Eligible businesses can now access Meta's new agent for free via Meta Ads. It's also available "at a fraction of the cost of other solutions," Meta wrote in a company blog post, for businesses based in the US that want to add it to their website, or to their WhatsApp and Messenger accounts, with availability in more countries expected soon. (A company spokesperson declined to provide additional details around the agent's pricing structure.) Alongside this product release, Meta had some news about its user experience and personalization policy. Starting Dec. 16, the company will begin using individual users' interactions with its Meta AI chatbot to customize the ads and content recommendations they see on Facebook and Instagram, the company announced Wednesday. Someone asking one of Meta's chatbots about local dining options, for example, might start seeing ads for nearby restaurants on Meta platforms. There's no opt-out option for the new personalization changes, Meta said in its announcement. You always have the option of not interacting with the company's chatbots while using its apps, of course, but the company is also reportedly working on chatbots that proactively strike up a conversation with users. Also: My new favorite Photoshop AI tool lets me combine images in one click - and I can't stop Some conversation topics won't be included as training data, including anything that covers sexual orientation, health, race, religion, or political views. Chats that take place before Dec. 16 also won't be used, and the personalization changes will not initially apply to users in the UK, South Korea, or the European Union, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to ZDNET. While Meta said it won't start using chat data for targeting ads until Dec. 16, it's hard not to see a relationship between the company's increased in-house personalization via AI and the launch of external AI personalization tools for businesses. It's unclear what the relationship will be between user chat data and the models powering external tools for advertisers. Meta also announced Thursday that it was launching more AI tools to help businesses create ads on Advantage+, its AI-powered social media ad campaign management platform. There's a new AI-generated music feature, for example, which, according to Meta, "understands the content of an ad and produces unique, custom music that reflects the product, style, and sentiment -- helping brands better engage their audiences and connect in new ways." Also: Meta wants AI to automate every step of the ad production process - report The company also introduced AI dubbing for quick translation to reach international audiences, a tool for generating higher-quality AI-generated videos in ads, and another that generates a set of images curated to different audience demographics. The new features build on a broader offering of generative AI tools for advertisers, which Meta first began rolling out in October 2023, during the company's so-called "Year of Efficiency," which centered on -- among other initiatives -- internal layoffs and a shift in focus toward AI. While Meta pushes new AI tools to businesses to help them sell products, the company is also working towards automating the entirety of the advertising production process, from ideation to campaign launch -- although it isn't totally clear at this point what such comprehensive automation might look like in practice. Also: The work AI should really be doing, according to these pros Similarly, Amazon unveiled an agent last month that can assist with every step of creating a short video ad, including the generation of custom voiceovers.

Title: OpenAI valuation reaches $500 billion, topping Musk’s SpaceX
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/openai-valuation-reaches-500-billion-topping-musks-spacex/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T18:37:55Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500 billion valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300 billion level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year. That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies. Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp. now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars. Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp. and SK Hynix Inc. Representatives for Thrive Capital and Dragoneer didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, SoftBank and T. Rowe Price spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for MGX said the firm is “pleased to be a core partner to OpenAI and to continue building on our strong relationship as a significant investor across multiple funding rounds.” The deal vaults OpenAI past SpaceX’s $400 billion valuation. That milestone coincides with a pivotal time for Altman’s company, which is in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. to convert into a more traditional for-profit company. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit dedicated to advancing digital intelligence “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Planned changes will give the existing OpenAI nonprofit entity control over a new public benefit corporation. Both Altman and Musk, who were OpenAI co-founders, have spoken about the potential existential risk to humans posed by AI. Yet they’ve since fallen out: Musk has sued to try and stop the overhaul, accusing OpenAI of forsaking promises to him when he helped to create the nonprofit. He claims it abandoned its founding purpose when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI’s board. When it comes to the business itself, OpenAI faces an increasingly competitive market for AI talent as big tech firms jockey for the resources they need. Meta Platforms Inc., for one, has recruited researchers aggressively from OpenAI and other top labs for its new “superintelligence” team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale could help OpenAI incentivize staff to stay at the company and turn down those lavish compensation offers. Major US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. OpenAI is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth. The value of a company tied to a secondary share sale is separate from the traditional private market valuation set when a startup completes a new round of funding. The total amount of eligible units sold in the secondary fell short of the $10 billion-plus worth of stock that the company allowed for sale, the person familiar said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private. That could mean current and former employees are demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability of the business, the person added. In the long run, OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure from rivals such as Google and Anthropic, which is also raising capital at a rapid clip. In response, OpenAI has embarked on a spate of recent technology product launches. Those include a pair of open and freely available artificial intelligence models that can mimic the human process of reasoning, months after China’s DeepSeek gained global attention with its own open software. OpenAI released its most powerful GPT-5 model in August, aimed at shoring up its lead in an increasingly crowded sphere. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Could AMD Make Intel's Business as Hot as Its Stock?

Time Published: 2025-10-02T18:13:19Z

Intel (INTC) was down and out, and then the White House flipped a switch and made it one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Semafor yesterday reported chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was in early talks to become an Intel Foundry customer. The report noted it was unclear how much of AMD’s business would go to Intel instead of its primary manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), or if the deal would include a direct investment. The White House is pushing hard to prop up Intel, which has spurred an outpouring of support for the embattled chipmaker from major tech companies. But none of the deals announced so far have come with commitments to use Intel's foundry. A manufacturing deal would signal more concrete support for Intel, giving investors more faith in the sustainability of its turnaround. The agreement would make AMD the latest in a string of entities partnering with or investing in Intel to extend a lifeline to one of the only U.S. companies capable of manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Japanese tech investor SoftBank in August invested $2 billion shortly before the White House converted Intel’s CHIPS Act grants into an approximately 10% equity stake. Nvidia (NVDA) followed suit in September when it said it would invest $5 billion and partner with Intel on new products. Intel has also reportedly discussed a tie-up with Apple (AAPL). Intel’s stock has soared amid the shows of support. Shares have doubled in value since hitting a year-to-date low in early April, and are up about 80% since CEO Lip-Bu Tan sat down with President Donald Trump in early August. It was shortly after that meeting that talk of the government taking a stake in Intel seemed to turn the tide in its favor. President Trump has made reviving American manufacturing a cornerstone of his second term, and semiconductors have taken on extra importance in the context of the U.S/China AI arms race and geopolitical tensions centered on Taiwan, where the majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors are made. The White House appears to think Intel is America’s best hope for making the kinds of chips deemed essential to securing technological and military superiority. Securing AMD as a foundry customer would be a major win for Intel, which has struggled for years to compete with TSMC, the world’s largest and most advanced contract chip maker. However, some analysts are skeptical that a foundry deal will materialize. “We could easily believe stories of companies (AMD or otherwise) seeking equity stakes, possibly at the encouragement of the administration,” wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a note on Thursday. “Hopes for a foundry deal (from anyone) seem very premature to us though, and not just because Intel and AMD remain locked in a competitive product battle that the latter is clearly winning at the moment.” The biggest challenge facing Intel in its efforts to strengthen its foundry business is capability, according to Bernstein. Intel’s new 18A manufacturing process, which is supposed to make chips faster and more energy efficient, “has suffered from delays and a general lack of foundry interest,” wrote Rasgon in August. And its next-gen 14A process, he says, is still years off. Investments from the government and tech partners may give Intel the capital it needs to improve its processes, but that will take time and Rasgon “suspect[s] concrete foundry announcements will have to wait until Intel can definitively demonstrate capability.” In the meantime, Rasgon expects to see more rumors of foundry deals bubble up as the White House carries on with its campaign to reinvigorate America’s industrial base.

The world's richest man just got richer. Elon Musk became the first person with a net worth of $500 billion in October 2025, according to Forbes. Rising Tesla shares fueled this jump in Musk's fortune. The company's stock was up nearly 17% year-to-date as of Oct. 2, 2025. Musk's wealth has been in the news for a proposed new pay package that could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shareholders are set to vote on this pay package in November. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. esla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

BySteve Denning, Senior Contributor. In my last article, How To Picture—And Understand—The Dow For The First Time, I showed how understanding the American stock market involves mastering the relationship between the long-term total return of leading firms and their performance on three key value-creating principles: Understanding how leading European stocks perform on the same measures in in Figure 1 provides further illumination. with some differences. Some of the American firms in the Dow win big in tech (The Mag 7 firms) but Europe dominates fashion (Hermès, LVMH) and has winners in tech (ASML) and defense.(RNMBF). Overall, European stocks have fewer big winners but also fewer bad losers. Value creation is key to long term performance in both, Firms doing consistently well on all three value-creation principles create more long term value than firms that don’t. 1.

Δ “Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Vlad Tenev told a panel at a cryptocurrency conference in Singapore on Wednesday (Oct. 1). “I think most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” said Tenev, whose comments were reported by CNBC. The CEO added that reaching 100% could take more than a decade. As that report notes, a tokenized asset is a digital representation of a real-world asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities, that can be recorded and traded on a blockchain. Robinhood in June began offering more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union, bringing the company’s stock to what was then a record high. “I think it will become the default way to get exposure to U.S. stocks outside the U.S.,” Tenev said, adding that he expects the practice to expand after there is more clarity around licensing and regulations throughout the world. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “I think that will come, starting in Europe, but then expanding to the rest of the world,” he said. Beyond Robinhood’s launch of tokenized stocks, the CNBC report points out that there have been other indications of tokenization’s growing popularity, with financial sector titans Morgan Stanley and BlackRock expressing interest. “I actually think cryptocurrency and traditional finance have been living in two separate worlds for a while, but they’re going to fully merge,” Tenev said at the event. Tenev is not alone in forecasting the transformative effect of tokenization. As covered here last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. “A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks,” PYMNTS wrote. “The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission.” The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has emphasized the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to make sure tokenization scales responsibly. “Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments,” that report concluded.

Title: ChatGPT owner OpenAI hits $500B valuation after massive sale of shares

Full Content:
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI’s rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T. Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank’s earlier investment in OpenAI’s $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit.

In Blackrock, Co Louth - reigning tidiest small town in Ireland, they’ll have you know - an older man snaps an errant piece of litter with his picker and shoves it into a bag. He glances down the frightfully clean path as the mobile melee that is a presidential campaign rolls into the seaside village The branded Heather Humphreys cars, bright yellow campaign jackets, the colourfully dressed candidate herself, and the not insignificant cohort of media orbiting her has roused the little village from its mid-morning slumber. A woman driving down the main street shrugs gamely at the camera crews and journalists, who stop traffic as they trail across the road after the candidate. Humphreys strides into The Village Garden cafe, a pretty coffee shop on Blackrock’s main thoroughfare, and brings the whole media kit and kaboodle with her. Spoonfuls of overnight oats and coffee cups hang in the air as the stunned patrons watch the national media overwhelm what had been, until moments ago, a peaceful coffee shop. In their surprised glee to meet her, husband and wife John and Catherine Pepper, natives of Blackrock, wrangle Humphreys for a chat. After a quick search in the depths of a handbag, a bit of paper is produced, and John insists that Humphreys sits down and signs a message to each of their children: Seán and Meábh who live locally, and Sienna who is out in Dubai. “And do one more,” he tells her, for a grandchild not yet born. “I wanted them to be the first in Blackrock and Dubai to have the president’s autograph,” John explains. Humphreys helped John, who is visually impaired, into the seat beside her along with his white cane. “It would be a terror if I collapsed beside the president,” he told her. [ On the canvass with Jim Gavin in Roscommon and Catherine Connolly in BallyfermotOpens in new window ] John, who is a lifelong Fianna Fáil supporter, assured Humphreys: “If I still had my faculties, I’d be out campaigning for you.” He explains to The Irish Times that he had canvassed for “Albert and for Charlie,” but would break the habit of a lifetime and vote for Humphreys instead of for Fianna Fáil. “And if I had my sight, I’d be campaigning for her. That’s what she means to me,” John said. Out on the prom, another Soldier of Destiny was pledging his support for Humphreys. Declan Breathnach, the former Fianna Fáil TD for Louth, has known Humphreys for years through local and national politics. They even danced together back in the day, though Breathnach says Humphreys had “two left feet”. But why would a former Fianna Fáil politician not support Jim Gavin? “I don’t know Jim Gavin, I suppose. And when you know somebody and know them on a very personal basis, I think it’s incumbent on you to say what you feel.” On Fianna Fáil’s presidential campaign in general, Breathnach says “there was a lot of dithering [that] went on within the organisation, and I’m sure that Billy Kelleher saw that as well”. Fine Gael couldn’t have crafted a canvass that suited Humphreys more. The visit to Blackrock revolved around the diligent Tidy Towns committee and, of course, the local credit union. Tidy Towns in Blackrock seems to be something akin to a local sport, or maybe a religion. [ Heather Humphreys denies Simon Harris pressured her to drop disability reformsOpens in new window ] The committee effusively thanked Humphreys for pushing for the competition to continue during Covid-19 when she was the minister responsible for community development. Blackrock manages a “voluntary” ban on election posters, which every candidate has known better than to breach. Mary Murtagh of Louth Tidy Towns together thanked Humphreys for her compliance. “It’s the cable ties,” Mary says, visibly wincing at the thought of them. Humphreys recalls how her grandmother would bring her to Blackrock on her holidays. “And we had the tea in a flask, and we had the sandwiches on the beach, weather permitting!” Someone produces a sprig of literal heather for her. “I’ve me bit of heather,” Humphreys says, as she fusses to pin it to her lapel, “heather for the Heather!” People are leaning out of passing car windows to pledge first preferences. There are “wee selfies,” everyone is citing whatever Monaghan relation they can think of (“your mother must have been good stock so!”) and the spirit of the late county and western star Big Tom is invoked more than once. “I knew him well,” Humphreys told a voter emolliently, “he was a gentle man, and a gentle giant”. As is compulsory any time Humphreys visits a town, she also goes into the local Connect Credit Union to approvingly survey it and its comparatively low rate of written-off loans. “Must be very decent people in Blackrock,” Humphreys, who used to work as a credit union manager, says. In nearby Ardee, Humphreys graciously makes impressed noises when shown around the town’s run-down, cobweb strewn castle; which the local community has been loyally trying to restore for over a decade. “It will be lovely when it’s finished,” Humphreys says, generously. She also calls into a Men’s Shed in Slane, where she tried her hand at working a circular saw. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: OpenAI Is World's Top Startup With $500B Valuation After Employee Share Sale

OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

FuncomGame PassGameStopMorning CheckpointROG Xbox Ally XStarbreeze Why is GameStop torching its business partner on social media? Can unionization help the studio behind Disco ElysiumÂ pull out of a rough couple of years? And what is one of the first people to get their Xbox Ally Rog handheld in the mail saying about it? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, Kotaku‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take a stroll down memory lane with this excerpt from then-chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shawn Layden’s speech at E3 2014. “It really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing,” Souls archeologist Lance McDonald wrote in a thread that’s been circulating again recently. 6 years ago @ShawnLayden delivered this mostly forgotten speech for PlayStation at E3, which for some reason it really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing. The CEO saying "It wasn't a multi-million seller, but that wasn't the point" at the time was nice pic.twitter.com/iK6KdnXm4w — Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) November 30, 2020 Project Baxter was a “co-op urban crawl through a reactive Dungeons & Dragons world, utilizing procedural tools to enhance emergent gameplay in an endlessly replayable setting.” It is no more. Starbreeze announced the project has been canceledÂ as it pivots to focusing exclusively on its multiplayer heist franchise. âThis was a difficult but necessary decision,âÂ CEO Adolf Kristjansson said in a statement. âOur strategy is clear: PAYDAY is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreezeâs position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.â The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, GamesIndustry.bizÂ reports. The change comes after the cancellation of a Disco Elysium sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads. “It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told GamesIndustry.biz. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio. You had no idea what was going to happen.” ZA/UM revealed a trailer for its next RPG, Zero Parades for Spies, at Sony’s most recent State of Play.

That was after several viral posts dunking on the latest Xbox move. Kotaku reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last. Funcom called the desert survival crafting MMO “the biggest release weâve had in our 32-year-long history of making great games,” but added that it now has begin the “difficult process” of laying some people off as it pivots toward a console launch next year. Dune: Awakening debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since. “The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues,” the studio told GamesIndustry.biz in a statement.

And my god, the console is quiet and well-cooled even at high TDP. One of the main strengths is the sound of the device. It [feels] like the sounds are going all around my head, I almost don’t need headphones.” The post has since been nuked.

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

Title: Job losses might be likely due to AI but Nvidia's CEO says the booming billion-dollar industry will always need more plumbers and electricians

It seems like it's AI or nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top. In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, "If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories." Huang argues, "The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom". "You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year." Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, tells Channel 4 News, that ‘electricians and plumbers’ will be the big winners in the AI race as the skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a 'boom'. #Tech #AI #Nvidia #Economy #C4News OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing "US dominance in artificial intelligence". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions. When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, "just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it.

Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that "Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be "totally, totally gone" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a "short-term dystopia" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing. Huang tells reporters, "You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade," but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that. 1.

Title: Why Adobe Stock Is A Cash Engine?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/02/why-adobe-stock-is-a-cash-engine/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:13:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is down 22% this year, primarily due to rising concerns centered on rising competition from both lower-cost creative software alternatives and new AI-powered tools, combined with signs of slowing growth in the company’s subscription business. Despite these headwinds, we believe the stock warrants a close look. Here is why we believe Adobe deserves your attention. Free Cash Flow Yield is calculated as free cash flow per share divided by the stock price. Why does this matter? High cash generation per share allows a company to invest in further revenue growth or distribute dividends, or buybacks to shareholders. For context, Adobe offers a wide array of software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, catering to enterprise clients in the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. But do these figures convey the whole picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine if Adobe still possesses an advantage that withstands scrutiny. This is just one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio takes a broader approach, aimed at mitigating stock-specific risks while providing exposure to potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The following statistics stem from a high FCF yield selection strategy between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025. These statistics are calculated based on monthly selections and assume that once a stock is chosen, it cannot be re-selected for the next 180 days. That being said, Adobe has faced considerable declines during difficult periods. It dropped roughly 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decrease was around 60%. Even less severe declines, such as in 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic, erased approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite its numerous advantages, Adobe is not immune to adverse market conditions. However, the risk extends beyond major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market environments—consider events such as earnings releases, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor—especially given the fluctuations associated with individual stocks. Instead, look at the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ChatGPT Shopping: How to Get AI to Recommend Your Products
URL: https://backlinko.com/chatgpt-shopping-optimization
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:05:17Z
Full Content:
A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers getaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Written by Yongi Barnard ChatGPT recommends products — complete with photos, pricing, and purchase links — to its 700 million weekly users. And now customers can complete purchases without leaving the chat. BIG deal. But will ChatGPT recommend your products? That’s not automatic. And you can’t pay for placement. What you can do is optimize your site so ChatGPT understands what you sell, trusts your brand, and surfaces your products when buyers search. This guide shows you how. You’ll learn the eight-step framework for getting featured in ChatGPT Shopping. I also spoke with Leigh McKenzie, Backlinko’s Head of Growth and founder of the ecommerce brand UnderFit, to get his insights on what’s actually working. First, let’s look at how ChatGPT decides which products make the cut. ChatGPT Shopping kicks in automatically for some shopping intent prompts. While it doesn’t fire every time, I found it appears more often than not after testing 100+ prompts. The key? Typing a prompt with clear buying intent. Like “e-bikes that can handle potholes.” Instead of just explaining things or offering advice, ChatGPT Shopping recommends specific products. This includes product images, pricing, and links to online stores and websites where users can make a purchase. Side note: The ChatGPT Shopping experience isn’t consistent. Even with the same prompt, the carousel may (or may not) show. It can also appear at the top, middle, or bottom of the chat. This variability suggests the feature is still evolving. If your store gets recommended, countless high-intent shoppers will see your products. For example, when I tested the e-bike query, ChatGPT gave me a brief explanation of what features to prioritize. But it also provided a visual product carousel with eight products, each in its own card with key details. (It looks similar to Google Shopping ads, except you don’t have to pay for them.) Clicking on any card opens a side panel with: From there, users simply click “Visit” to reach the merchant’s product page. But this experience is changing. As of September 2025, OpenAI is rolling out Instant Checkout — a feature that lets shoppers buy directly inside ChatGPT. This is a huge shift. ChatGPT is no longer just a product discovery tool. It’s a full shopping destination. Right now, Instant Checkout is only available to Etsy sellers in the United States. But OpenAI plans to expand this feature to Shopify merchants and other countries soon. Not on either platform? They’re also accepting applications for merchants to build their own integrations. (More on this in Step #7.) A shopper describes what they’re looking for (“running shoes with arch support under $150”), and ChatGPT’s AI goes to work. It scans the web for the most relevant products based on that request. And weighs details like product names, descriptions, features, reviews, brand authority, and other signals to find the best matches. If your product checks the right boxes — and the information on your site is clear and crawlable — it has a chance to be recommended. ChatGPT may also consider the user’s location and preferences when making recommendations. Ultimately, all product recommendations must also pass through OpenAI’s safety systems. This filters out low-quality, misleading, or unsafe products. So, what does all of this mean for you? ChatGPT Shopping is evolving fast — and the brands that keep up will win the most visibility. Here’s how to ensure ChatGPT can understand, trust, and recommend your products. ChatGPT needs structured data to understand what you sell. Schema markup is code that labels key details on your product pages (and website as a whole): name, price, description, availability, reviews, and more. It turns raw HTML into data AI tools can parse instantly. Without it, ChatGPT (and other AI systems) have to guess what’s on your page. With it, they see clean, structured information they can confidently include in product recommendations. At a minimum, your product schema should include: It may look intimidating, but many content management systems — like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix — offer plugins or built-in tools that generate the markup for you automatically. Once your markup is in place, test that it’s working correctly using Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema.org’s validator. These tools make it easy to check that your structured data is valid, visible, and error-free. Pro tip: Go beyond the schema basics. Add AggregateRating for average review scores or FAQPage markup to answer common buyer questions. The more context you provide, the easier it is for AI to surface your product in response to specific prompts. A product feed is a structured file that packages up your product details and sends them to platforms like Google Merchant Center, Shopify, and Etsy. It includes details like titles, prices, availability, images, links, and more. ChatGPT may use data from major platforms like Google to decide which products to recommend. Pro tip: Want to add your product feed directly to ChatGPT? OpenAI will notify interested merchants when this feature is available. Fill out the Merchant Application form for consideration. For example, if your Google Shopping feed is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, ChatGPT may return bad information about your products. Or skip recommending them entirely. That’s why a high-quality, up-to-date product feed is critical. Side note: If you’re on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Shopify, feeds are usually created automatically. But keeping feeds accurate is easier said than done. There are a lot of moving parts, like site updates, refresh schedules, and third-party tools. And it only takes one slip for mismatches to creep in. Here are a few common product feed issues — and how to fix them: Automation keeps most updates in sync. And manual checks before major launches or sales help catch anything that may slip through. Here’s how Leigh maintains a balance of the two for his ecommerce store: “I keep all my product data in a spreadsheet. Whenever I change a product detail, I update it there first. WooCommerce uses that data to update my site’s pages and schema automatically. Then, Channable takes the same spreadsheet and syncs those updates into my product feeds. That way, my site and my feeds are always pulling from the same source, so everything stays consistent.” If ChatGPT can’t read your site, it can’t recommend your products. Two simple technical issues block many ecommerce sites from showing up: hidden content and restricted crawlers. Many AI bots — including ChatGPT — still struggle with content that only loads via JavaScript. If key details aren’t in the page’s raw HTML, the bot might never see them. This includes your product descriptions, prices, and images. Eek. Here’s how to check if that’s happening: If your product details disappear, it means they’re only loading through JavaScript. To fix this, work with a developer to ensure all essential information is in your site’s raw HTML. Your robots.txt file can also block AI crawlers. This small file tells bots which parts of your site they can (and can’t) crawl. By default, most sites already allow all bots, including ChatGPT’s crawler, OAI-SearchBot. But it’s still worth double-checking. Here’s how: First, go to yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Then, look for a rule like this: And this: If it says “Disallow,” then ChatGPT is unable to crawl your site. You (or your dev team) can fix this issue by changing it to “allow.” Further reading: 23 Best Large Language Models ChatGPT matches products to prompts by language, not keywords. So, if your product copy doesn’t sound like the way people talk, it may not surface in shopping results. The goal: write the way buyers phrase their prompts. You don’t have to guess how your customers talk. Use research tools like: Look for modifiers that mimic real queries — terms like “best,” “for beginners,” “eco-friendly,” or “kid-friendly.” Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit show you the actual prompts people type into AI engines. So, instead of manually guessing or testing one by one, you get a ready-made list of conversational queries buyers already use. Once you understand how your audience speaks, weave the terms naturally into your product titles and descriptions. This will increase the odds of your products showing up in ChatGPT when shoppers search. Further reading: 11 Awesome ChatGPT Alternatives to Try When you’re writing copy, pay special attention to your product titles. They often feed directly into the shopping carousel. And they’re the first thing shoppers see before deciding to click. The golden rule: Lead with what matters most to your audience. If trust drives decisions — like in categories such as laptops or smartphones — put your brand front and center. If features, benefits, or use cases are more important, focus on those instead. Use this simple formula: [Main Benefit or Feature] + [Product Type] (+ [Brand] if it builds trust) On Leigh’s site, for example, his titles highlight what buyers care about most: product benefits. That’s why they’re structured as Benefit (Invisible) + Product Type (Undershirt). But when brand recognition is vital to trust, it makes sense to include the brand name. Like this product title for a Sony home theater: Don’t worry about cramming every detail into the title. Most ecommerce platforms give you multiple fields for product info. Use those strategically to sprinkle in conversational keywords. Titles get people to click. Descriptions get them to buy. This is where you expand on features, benefits, and use cases — all in plain, natural language. For example, UnderFit’s product copy mirrors the words buyers use when searching for an undershirt. These words aren’t filler — they’re search terms. Which means they’re likely the same language people use when prompting ChatGPT. Your product’s value proposition needs to be clear and visible at the top of your product page. This ensures ChatGPT immediately understands: But that’s not enough. The rest of your page should support and reinforce that promise. This gives ChatGPT a complete picture of your product. And helps it see your product as the best fit for the query. This means every section — features, benefits, reviews, specs — should back up your value proposition with proof and detail. Huel’s Black Edition product page is a great example of this in action. The value proposition is right under the product title: “High Protein Complete Meal.” This instantly explains: The image reinforces this by highlighting complementary copy: “This is a meal. Not a protein shake” and “40g protein per meal.” The product description repeats the promise yet again: “40 grams of protein.” But it also adds details like “27 essential vitamins and minerals.” This repetition is exactly what you want. While you can (and should) use word variety, your page should tell one clear story from top to bottom. Explain what the product is, why it’s valuable, and how it delivers on that promise. So, audit your site. If copy and images don’t reinforce your core message, rework them until it does. The more consistent and focused your messaging is, the easier it is for ChatGPT to understand (and recommend) your products. Further reading: How to Use AI for Writing Exceptional Content (7 Best Practices) ChatGPT doesn’t just look at your product page when deciding what to recommend. It cross-checks authority signals from across the web to figure out whether your brand (and your product) are trustworthy enough to recommend. These signals include: One way to see which sources matter most for your brand is to run a manual check in ChatGPT. Type a shopping prompt into the tool, scroll to the answer, and click “Sources.” The links you see there are the sites that ChatGPT used to pull its recommendations. (And, by extension, the sites it trusts.) For example, when I asked for a “yoga mat with serious grip for hot yoga,” ChatGPT cited: Use the sources as your roadmap. Target them with outreach strategies like expert quotes, partnerships, and co-branded content. Can’t land mentions on the exact sites ChatGPT cited? Go after similar ones with comparable authority. And build your presence on community platforms, too. A strong showing on Reddit, Quora, and niche Facebook groups can boost your brand’s credibility. Instant Checkout lets shoppers go from product recommendation to purchase without ever leaving ChatGPT. Once they find something they like, they can confirm details, pay, and place an order — all within the same chat window. (Hashtag mind blown) Instant Checkout currently supports single-item purchases in the U.S. on Etsy. (But Shopify integration is coming soon.) If you’re on either platform, you’re in luck. Eligibility is automatic. For everyone else? You’ll need to apply and integrate with OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). Translation: Roll up your sleeves. There’s work to do. Here’s what you can do now. Start by filling out OpenAI’s merchant application form. This lets OpenAI know you want in. They’re onboarding merchants on a rolling basis and will reach out when you’re accepted. Once you’re in the pipeline, you’ll need to: Pro tip: Even if ChatGPT Instant Checkout isn’t available for your store yet, preparing your product data, feeds, and backend now will help you move faster when it is. This should give you a head start as this feature gains popularity. It’s not enough to show up in ChatGPT Shopping. You also need to measure how well you’re performing. Start with tracking traffic. The easiest way is through OpenAI’s built-in UTM tag. This is code that OpenAI automatically adds to all outbound links. And looks like this: Set up a custom segment in Google Analytics to track and analyze ChatGPT traffic to your site. Once that’s done, look for patterns: Side note: Not every ChatGPT mention will be traceable. Some users see your product in a chat and search your brand directly on Google instead of clicking. Look for spikes in branded search traffic or direct visits to gauge the broader impact of LLMs. But traffic only tells you what happens after people click. You also need to measure what happens before — specifically, which prompts surface your products. To do this, it helps to understand the kinds of prompts shoppers type. Most fall into four buckets. Think of these buckets as templates. Test prompts in each category and ask yourself: Repeatedly run these checks to gather more data. You’ll learn which prompts lead to product mentions, how your LLM visibility changes, and how buyers talk about your brand. Rather automate this process? Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit let you: There isn’t a magic formula for getting ChatGPT to recommend your products.

Full Content:
Nasdaq has filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to list the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a product designed to generate income by selling options on bitcoin-linked holdings. The proposal was submitted on September 30, 2025, and the SEC has opened a comment period as part of its review. According to the Nasdaq filing, the Trust will hold primarily bitcoin, shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), cash, and the premiums earned from written options on IBIT or on indices that track spot bitcoin ETPs. The product is described as an actively-managed exchange-traded product that the sponsor intends to be treated as a publicly-traded partnership for US federal tax purposes. The filing also sets a minimum of 80,000 Shares required to be outstanding at commencement, and lists trading hours from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. BlackRock’s move follows a wider push by asset managers to offer income-style crypto products. Reports have disclosed that the new ETF would collect premiums by writing covered calls, a strategy meant to produce regular distributions for investors who want yield rather than pure price exposure. Analysts quoted in market coverage say the approach limits upside in strong rallies but can smooth returns when bitcoin moves sideways or down. Covered calls are straightforward in concept but not without risk. The Trust would hold IBIT and bitcoin while selling call options against those holdings to collect premiums. If the calls are exercised early, the filing says IBIT shares may be delivered out to the options clearer; certain OTC options would be cash-settled. That mix of physical holdings and options income is intended to create a yield-focused product that behaves differently from a spot ETF. Market watchers note this is not BlackRock’s first bitcoin product. Based on reports, IBIT has already become a major vehicle for US investors since its launch, reaching large asset levels quickly and helping to normalize bitcoin exposure inside regulated funds. That track record likely makes it easier for BlackRock to pitch a second, income-focused offering to both retail and institutional audiences. The next steps are procedural but important. The SEC’s notice solicits public comments and will consider whether the proposed listing satisfies Nasdaq’s Rule 5711(d) and investor-protection standards. If the SEC requires changes — for example on disclosure around OTC options or daily NAV dissemination — Nasdaq and BlackRock would have to respond before trading can begin.

Title: Tokenized US Stocks & ETFs Coming To Telegram Wallet Via Kraken & BackedFi

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Telegram is taking another step toward bridging traditional finance with crypto. Through a new partnership among Wallet in Telegram, xStocks operator Backed, and US-based crypto exchange Kraken, tokenized equities will soon be available directly within the messaging platform. The announcement, made on Wednesday, confirms that users will gain access to tokenized versions of US equities. Wallet in Telegram, a third-party crypto wallet app integrated into the Telegram ecosystem, will serve as the gateway for this new offering. By leveraging xStocks, which specializes in tokenized assets, and Kraken’s infrastructure, the platform aims to deliver seamless trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. Users will be able to purchase fractions of these equities in digital form, opening access to markets that are typically less inclusive. This move represents a significant evolution in Telegram’s crypto ecosystem, expanding beyond digital assets into the tokenization of traditional securities. It also underscores the growing role of tokenized finance in making equities more accessible, liquid, and tradable across global markets. With the launch planned for late October, investors are watching closely to see how Telegram’s massive user base responds to this new frontier. The news was shared by Wallet in Telegram’s chief strategy officer, Halil Mirakhmed, during Token2024 Singapore, highlighting the project’s mission to merge traditional financial markets with Web3 accessibility. At the same event, Max Crown, President & CEO of the TON Foundation, outlined the significance of the move in his keynote at Token2049. He emphasized that the partnership with xStocks, in collaboration with Kraken and Backed, will allow over 100 million Telegram users to access more than 60 tokenized US assets at launch. These will include major names such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and MicroStrategy (MSTR), all backed by a 1:1 collateralization framework to ensure trust and transparency. One of the most notable features of this integration is fractional ownership, which enables users to purchase small portions of high-value stocks that might otherwise remain inaccessible. Trading will also be available 24 hours a day, five days a week, breaking away from the restrictions of traditional US market hours. This flexibility lowers barriers for global investors and represents a major step toward democratizing access to equities. Looking ahead, xStocks is set to become available on the TON blockchain in Q4, further cementing TON’s role as the foundation for Telegram’s growing financial ecosystem. By combining blockchain scalability, tokenization, and Telegram’s massive user base, the initiative has the potential to redefine how millions of people interact with traditional markets. Toncoin (TON) is trading around $2.80 after a modest rebound of nearly 3.6% on the 3-day chart. Despite the short-term bounce, the broader trend remains bearish, with TON locked in a prolonged downtrend since peaking above $8.50 in early 2024. Price has consistently posted lower highs and lower lows, signaling persistent selling pressure. The moving averages reinforce this picture. TON remains well below its 50-period (blue), 100-period (green), and 200-period (red) moving averages. The inability to reclaim these levels underscores weak momentum and the dominance of bears in the market. The $3.00 area has become a critical resistance zone; without a decisive break above it, TON risks further sideways or downward action. Support continues to cluster near $2.50–$2.70, where buyers have stepped in repeatedly over the past months. A breakdown below this level could accelerate losses toward $2.00, while a successful defense may allow the token to consolidate and attempt another push higher.

Title: Robinhood CEO: Here’s when the tokenisation ‘freight train’ will shake up the $115tn stock market

Time Published: 2025-10-02T08:43:10Z

About us Copy link Bringing stocks, bonds, and just about every other financial asset onchain is inevitable. At least according to Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev. “Tokenisation is like a freight train,” Tenev told a captive audience at this year’s Token2049 crypto confab in Singapore. “It’s going to eat the entire financial system.” During a fireside panel in the Marina Bay Sands convention centre, the 38-year-old entrepreneur unpacked how the $127 billion stock trading app is positioning itself to tap the burgeoning tokenisation niche. In June, Tenev announced the launch of over 200 tokenised stocks on Arbitrum, a Ethereum layer 2 network, for its users in Europe. The launch also included tokenised equity in private companies, such as Tesla and OpenAI. But when will tokenised stocks become available in the US and then globally? “Most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” Tenev said. “I think a hundred per cent? That might take a decade or more.” For years, turning traditional financial assets into cryptocurrencies has been pitched as a key upgrade to financial markets. The technology ostensibly eliminates intermediaries and streamlines back offices required for trading equities and other assets. Despite these perceived advantages, it has yet to take hold in a meaningful way. The entire tokenisation market is worth $32 billion, according to rwa.xyz. Meanwhile, the global public stock market is valued at more than $115 trillion as of 2023, according to the World Economic Forum. Still, companies — on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley — are working to close that gap. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and other stalwart asset managers are actively tapping blockchain technologies to tokenise various fund products. Elsewhere, crypto firms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Kraken are moving to offer tokenised stock trading, too. The enthusiasm comes amid key market structure legislation winding its way through the halls of the US Congress. Draft bills outline which financial agency will regulate newer asset classes, such as tokenised stocks and cryptocurrencies alike. The House Clarity Act passed in July, while the Senate version is still being debated. Ultimately, lawmakers will merge the two versions before executing a vote as early as the end of the year. Thanks to the European Union’s comprehensive crypto rulebook, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, the continent has a slight lead in terms of crypto adoption — for now. “Unfortunately, but realistically, the US will probably be somewhat behind,” Tenev said. “The US will probably be the last economy to fully tokenise. But it’s inevitable. “ Liam Kelly is DL News Berlin-based DeFi Correspondent. Got a tip? Email at liam@dlnews.com.

More Info BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is negotiating the acquisition of power utility AES in a deal that could be worth $38 billion. That would make the tie-up one of the largest in history involving a public power utility in the United States, per Reuters. Media reports on the news cited sources in the know that remained unnamed and that said the deal included AES’s substantial debt load, at $29 billion, per the Financial Times. Its market capitalization, on the other hand, was valued at $9.4 billion at the time the first reports about the talks surfaced. Later, Reuters said AES’s market cap has risen to $10.94 billion, giving the potential deal a total value of over $40 billion. The reports suggest that BlackRock’s approach is related to the strong growth in electricity demand coming from the booming IT sector thanks to artificial intelligence development and the rush to build data centers to handle AI. AES gas spent a substantial sum of money over the past few years on building low-carbon generation infrastructure, namely wind and solar installations, to supply Big Tech majors concerned about their green energy credentials. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that AES had become the subject of takeover interest from large investment firms and was studying a sale. At the time, the enterprise value of the company was calculated at some $40 billion. It has electricity supply deals with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, among others. As of July, however, the company’s stock was down 38%. As of this week, the stock is down by close to 23% over the past 12 months, but it rebounded on the news that Global Infrastructure Partners was in advanced talks for the acquisition of the company. GIP itself became part of BlacRock last year, for a price of $12.5 billion. The company currently manages some $200 billion worth of assets worldwide.

Title: OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation after share sale

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank's earlier investment in OpenAI's $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Can XRP’s recovery extend itself as RLUSD eyes $800 million? He will remain with the team in an advisory role to have more time with his family. XRP’s price slipped after the update, but it rallied soon after. Ripple Labs is set for a key leadership reshuffle by the end of the year as current CTO David Schwartz will step away from his role. However, he will join the Ripple Board of Directors. In a statement, Schwartz said he will continue to work on side projects and novel applications for the XRP Ledger. “The last few months I’ve been tinkering on the side – spinning up my own XRPL node and publishing its output data, researching other use cases for XRP (besides what Ripple is focused on), and more.” He has been with Ripple for over 13 years and is part of the founding team of the XRP Ledger. Surprisingly, Schwartz contributed to Bitcoin’s early days and was even mistaken for being Satoshi Nakamoto last year. For his part, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed his illustrious impact on the XRP community as “legend.” Source: X In another development, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, expanded by nearly $50 million after last week’s BlackRock and VanEck partnership. It has also expanded to African markets via stablecoin payment providers in the region. Overall, RLUSD’s market cap is close to hitting $800 million – Underscoring strong growth for a stablecoin that debuted last December. Meanwhile, XRP closed Tuesday’s trading session in the red, with a 1.2% price dip after Schwartz’s update. However, it soon shrugged off the loss and rallied by about 4% on Wednesday. This, after Bitcoin’s [BTC] spike on the back of the U.S government’s shutdown. Source: XRP/USDT, TradingView In fact, the altcoin has consolidated for three months on the charts. And, it could front a bullish breakout or capitulate over the next few days. Market bulls might be ready for another run too. Especially since Binance’s top trader data showed they added 3% of long positions from 67% to 70% in the last three days.

Title: Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios announces Liverpool shutdown and workforce cuts in Sweden

The Swedish developer behind the Just Cause and Mad Max series, Avalanche Studios, has announced the shutdown of its Liverpool studio, alongside a reduction of workforce at its core Malmo and Stockholm locations. The studio broke the news in a statement published on the company’s website on September 30, 2025, amid ongoing hurdles in the gaming industry. The Liverpool studio, established in 2020 as part of its global expansion, has now ceased operation entirely. Previously, the Liverpool location focused on support roles and had not released any standalone titles. Avalanche stated: In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success best. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio and to initiate a collective consultation process as required by UK law. This will impact all “Avalanchers” in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmo and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs. The company also mentioned that it is focusing on offering full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time and that, despite the structural changes, the studio will remain fully committed to delivering amazing games to its passionate players. Currently, the number of affected employees remains under wraps. Avalanche Studios Group employs more than 600 people worldwide. This move marks the third such action by the company in just over a year, following the shutdown of its New York and Montreal offices in June 2024, which resulted in 50 layoffs. This announcement comes just one month after Microsoft canceled the co-op heist game, Contraband, which was being developed by Avalanche’s Liverpool team, which was first revealed four years ago in 2021. In August 2025, Microsoft paused development on the title amid its sweeping layoffs, and Avalanche announced that “active development has now stopped.” Considering the given circumstances, it seems unlikely that Contraband will be released anytime soon.

Title: This Working Life: ‘Patrick Kavanagh was spellbinding. He was radical. I had to get involved’

Art Agnew is a volunteer at the Patrick Kavanagh Centre and former principal of St Louis in Carrickmacross Art Agnew My father and mother were our teachers at our school in Co Louth. And my grandfather and grandmother were teachers before them. I was born in 1943 and had three older sisters and three younger sisters. I was reasonably quick at school, though my sisters were all very quick. Three sisters joined the St Louis order in Carrickmacross, one left and became a teacher. My eldest sister was a nurse. My next three sisters became teachers and my younger sister was a social worker. I was a bit young at 17 when I started my teacher training in St Pat’s in Drumcondra. I went back teaching at home in Kilcurry and in 1962 returned to Dublin and started in the Christian Brothers in Crumlin. At night we did a BA in UCD as mature students. I studied English, philosophy and economics. I loved these subjects – but my love of Kavanagh did not come from them. The thing is Kavanagh was always about. He had grown up six miles away in Inniskeen. My grandaunt Brigit had taught him. She was the Miss Moore in his semi-autobiography The Green Fool. I was teaching in Crumlin for four years. I enjoyed it – though it was challenging teaching 40 boys in one class. They ranged in ability from the very bright to those who needed help. My mother told me that if I had the opportunity to go to my Aunty Gaye in Terenure for my dinner. I used to get an hour-and-a-half lunch with the Christian Brothers and it was not too hard to get there from Crumlin. We did not finish school until 4pm then. We used to get buns on a Friday, but back then not every child was well fed, it is good they have free school meals now. I knew I was not going to spend my life teaching in Dublin. I saw a position advertised in St Louis in Carrickmacross. My sister, mother and godmother had been at school there. I got the job and I stayed until I retired in 2005. I was principal for the last seven years. I was part of the community from which the children came. Occasionally I could be dealing with pastoral care, dealing with parents – and by the time I became principal, I was familiar with many kinds of problems. The vast majority of parents were supportive, the children generally had good parents. It was very important to know the parents when the idea of special needs came in. In the past, parents were a wee bit reticent about speaking up for their kids. I remember one child who came into the office this day around 2000, with tears in her eyes. But those tears were tears of joy. “I am dyslexic,” she told me, “I knew I was not thick.” I enjoyed my work – but I won’t say I enjoyed every single day as Helen, my late wife, will confirm. I would come home and I would be exhausted. I’d sit in the armchair and not get out of it until bedtime. At those times you would have hoped you could solve a problem but you could not. The things you need are energy and patience. And a comradeship with the teaching staff, and to give people space. We had a tea-break at 10.50 – and as principal you learn not to arrive into the staff room on time. You’d give people six or seven minutes before you land in to get a cup of tea, so they could suppress their annoyances with the system. We had a strong public speaking and debating tradition in the school. We took part in debating competitions in Dublin run by university students and we got to several finals. There was one time in the Eighties when we were playing the Donegal team in basketball and we had to cross the Border. Things were a bit grim at the time. Anyway, we were stopped and were waiting for clearance. There was a female soldier and she called out that she wanted our bus searched. Who came on the bus but two young soldiers. So our head girl jokes: “You can search me.” The soldiers went scarlet, with all the girls beaming at them – and they left. We went on and we won that game. Our next game was in Cork, and then we won the All-Ireland. Helen stayed at home with our four children. With my father and mother both teaching, I thought my mother had to work too hard when I was growing up. So we survived on one salary. We did ok. I taught two of our daughters Neasa and Rosita, and they didn’t mind. Rosita was the first student in Ireland to get eight A1s in her Leaving – though she’ll kill me for bringing that up. I retired in 2005 and that meant we had time to go travelling. We went to America, twice, and all over the EU. Helen died two years ago, there is much grieving – and you have to go along with it, you have to put up with it. You have to get on with things – and having four children and 10 grandchildren is a great diversion for me. I have many photographs of Helen around the house and I include her in all my conversations. We met in the Pavilion Ballroom in Blackrock, near Dundalk, on an August Bank Holiday. It turned out she grew up five miles away from me – and at the time she lived 200 yards away from my bedsit in Dublin, and so that was that. Apart from my interest in soccer, I had a grá for poetry. I had been to a lecture Patrick Kavanagh gave in Earlsfort Terrace. He was spellbinding. He was radical. I felt it was important to get involved. In 1967, the year he died, I was teaching and doing the degree at night – but two years before that, we had called into O’Dwyers pub one night. He was there with John Jordan, James Liddy, Macdara Woods and I heard him say “the top of Parnassus is flat”. Much later I was out in Greece with Helen – and it was indeed flat. I did not go talking to him that night. He was in own company. I went to his wake on Haddington Road, but I was teaching and could not go to his funeral. I got involved with the Patrick Kavanagh Centre because my grandaunt taught him and because my mother was in the training college with his sister Celia. My sister Una has written extensively on Kavanagh. In 1998 she wrote The Mystical Imagination of Patrick Kavanagh. I’ve been active since 1980 in organising Kavanagh’s yearly weekend in late September to mark his birthday. We used to hold it in November, but the weather in Carrickmacross and Inniskeen was too poor. We held it last Sunday and there were around 70 at the graveside. People came from all over Ireland. We had a poetry workshop, the Patrick Kavanagh award and a book launch, and a panel discussion on the inevitability of art. Then after that we had a film screening of Three Irish Writers – about Kavanagh, Brendan Behan and Myles na gCopaleen. In a way it was awful to watch, they all died young enough. After that we went out to the Brew House for a story telling session and a nice beer. The Kavanagh Centre opened in 1994 in what would have been St Mary’s Church, and the cemetery is where Kavanagh’s remains rest. Monaghan County Council invested nearly €1m in refurbishing the centre – and it’s world class. The annual poetry competition has been going since the Patrick Kavanagh Society was set up in 1971. The lady who won this year was Róisín Leggett Bohan from Cork. She was good. Her poetry is like Emily Dickinson with a nip to it. When I retired, I became kitman for the under 18’s Irish soccer international team. I was in 12 European countries and Turkey. I did that until 2009. I’ve been involved with Carrick Rovers since 1968, I am on the committee and would watch the matches and that. Jack Charlton and Brian Kerr brought their Irish squads to Carrickmacross and they trained on our grounds, and Ronnie Moran also brought the Liverpool squad. I have to get out of the bed before 9am. I make porridge the night before with raisins. I add honey and a banana. I walk to the shop for the paper. I’ll have tea and toast at 11. I would go walking most days. It would depend if I had anything to do. I might call out to the Kavanagh Centre if it is busy. We have schools coming all the time when Kavanagh is on the Leaving. I used to love doing the tours, but retired from tour guiding last year. I’m also chair of the Inniskeen Development Group, though again I’m planning on retiring next month. I can get around no problem at 82. There are a few who are not as fortunate and they need visiting. You know you have to do it and you do it – and you enjoy it. I’m not spouting any wings. My mother was a great believer in putting people at ease by talking away with them. And I think I have a doctorate in trivia. When I got the teaching job in Carrickmacross, in the late Sixties, towns were encouraging people to come and live there. There were 45 serviced sites, so we applied for a bungalow and got it. And I am still there today. I can cook. I’ve always cooked. I make my lunch at home. I generally go to the butcher on a Saturday. In the winter I buy half a pound of stewing meat, a sideline chop and a pork chop and lamb liver to keep me going until Thursday, then in the fish shop I buy hake, smoked cod and mackerel to take me to Friday. Generally speaking I would go to McNallys on a Friday night and meet friends. A year and a half ago we started a ciorcal comhrá – and Irish conversation group – on Wednesday evenings in the library. There are usually between 10 to 12 of us. Tomorrow I’m getting the bus to Dublin to go to a past-pupils reunion of those boys who left in 1973. They invited me. They started in 1968 and so did I. I was happy to be invited. Many have been so supportive since Helen died. I would read a good deal at night. At the moment it’s a book on the Roman empire and Frank McNally’s Not Making Hay. He is a good armchair writer, I’m full of chuckles. I would say Spraying the Potatoes is my favourite Kavanagh poem. There is a lyrical earthiness about it. I am often asked about line: “The axle-roll of a rut-locked cart/Broke the burnt stick of noon in two.” It was never fully explained by him – but I think it was just the hint of going home for the dinner. Noon in Ireland was twenty-five past one. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Wall Street indexes closed higher Wednesday, primarily boosted by the healthcare sector following Pfizer's drug price agreement with President Trump. Investors largely overlooked weaker private payrolls data and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, demonstrating historical market resilience. Technology stocks also contributed to gains, while the materials sector declined.

Title: Bitcoin Surges Past $116K Despite U.S. Government Shutdown: Is $120K Next?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin blasted through $116,000 with a 3% daily gain even as the U.S. government officially entered shutdown, its first since 2018. The political stalemate over health-care funding has 750,000 federal workers on furlough and could cost about $400 million per day, yet risk assets shook off early nerves. Crypto’s total market cap rose 3% to $4.09T, with Bitcoin leading and dominance climbing from 57% to 59%, a structure analysts say tends to produce more durable rallies than altcoin-led surges. Gold’s sprint to fresh records near $3,875–$3,895/oz underlined the flight-to-safety backdrop, but BTC’s two-day rebound from $112,000 suggests buyers are treating macro uncertainty as a dip-buying opportunity. Fueling the rally, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.53 billion in net inflows in September, topped by $429.9 million on Sept. 30 (BlackRock, Ark, Fidelity leading). On-chain and derivatives data indicate healthy conditions as leverage resets after the decline, funding levels normalize, and open interest remains steady, allowing BTC to resume its upward trend. Technical analysts point to a multi-week bull flag with the price now pushing against the upper boundary, mirroring patterns seen before previous impulsive moves. Seasonality also favors the market, with “Uptober” traditionally showing strong performance after a positive September close. Telegram’s Pavel Durov even revived long-term optimism, reaffirming a $1 million BTC target driven by fixed supply versus money printing, sentiment often seen during mid-cycle expansions. In the near term, Bitcoin resistance is around $117,500. A clear reclaim and daily close above this level could pave the way toward $119,300–$120,300, with a psychological target near $ 120,000. Order-book heatmaps indicate significant short liquidity between $118,000 and $119,000 (about $7 billion), which could trigger a squeeze if this level is broken. On the downside, bulls aim to defend the $114,800–$115,200 zone first, then the $112,000 pivot identified before the bounce; below that, there’s a larger liquidity pocket at $107,000–$108,000 (roughly $8 billion in long liquidations). Analysts MN van de Poppe, Ted Pillows, and Daan Crypto Trades all agree on the same strategy: hold $112,000, break above $117,500, and then let momentum push toward new highs into Q4.

The skin care brand is unable to accept new orders on its website, with customers being redirected to Amazon. Senior Editor, Beauty What’s going on with Glamglow? The Estée Lauder Cos.-owned brand has removed e-commerce capabilities and content from its website. Instead, a text-based page now informs shoppers that while it’s unable to accept new orders, it’s still here “to help with any existing orders or refunds.” Shoppers are advised that they can still buy Glamglow products on Amazon. Lauder declined to comment when asked if the brand was shuttering or now only selling on Amazon. Related Articles Skin Care Nordic Impact: Oslo Skin Lab Lands in Milan Fashion Scoops Lucy Bridge Is Tom Ford's First Global Makeup Artist Glamglow, which Lauder acquired in 2014 for an undisclosed amount, has been struggling for some time. In 2022, former chief executive officer Fabrizio Freda initiated layoffs although exact numbers are unknown. At the same time, its international presence was scaled back, meaning that it is now only sold in the U.S. Glamglow also streamlined its product offering to an estimated 13 top sellers, focusing on hero and high replenishment. “This initiative will help return Glamglow to profitability and will leave a distribution point for loyal consumers to experience and purchase the brand and support future growth opportunities,” Lauder said in a statement at the time. Glamglow is part of Lauder’s trio of Califoria brands that also includes Smashbox and Too Faced. As Lauder evaluates its portfolio, it has long been speculated that this group could be considered for possible divestment. During the earnings call in August, Stéphane de La Faverie, the current president and CEO of Lauder, noted that it recently engaged an external adviser as the group considers evolving its overall brand portfolio.

Title: Aware Super, Goodman Group Launch $1.3B U.S. Logistics Platform
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/aware-super-goodman-logistics-industrial-california/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T22:00:54Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Two Australian titans have joined forces on a $1.3 billion logistics real estate platform that is leased to heavyweight tenants like Amazon. Aware Super, one of Australia’s largest pension fund managers, bought a 49 percent stake in the venture with Goodman Group, a global industrial and infrastructure developer. The firms will target “undersupplied” infill industrial markets within the U.S. The exact financial contribution of each firm was not disclosed. Three assets currently comprise the $1.3 billion platform, all in Southern California totaling nearly 2.8 million square feet. They include Goodman Commerce Center Long Beach, at 2401 East Wardlow Road, Goodman Commerce Center Los Angeles, at 4841 West San Fernando, and Goodman Gateway Santa Fe Springs, which makes up two contiguous properties at 12801 Excelsior Drive and 14420 Bloomfield Avenue. The properties are currently leased by the likes of Amazon, Maersk and Relativity Space. Relativity Space in 2021, for example, inked a roughly 1 million-square-foot lease at Goodman Commerce Center Long Beach. “Our U.S. business represents over 37 percent of Goodman Group’s offshore earnings and is an increasingly important part of our global investment strategy,” Gregory Goodman, Goodman Group’s CEO, said in a statement. “Alongside our long-standing investment partner, Aware Super, we see significant growth opportunities in our key U.S. infill markets to support the development of essential infrastructure in a rapidly transforming digital economy.” Goodman controls several industrial platforms and portfolios across the U.S., including one it splits with Norges Bank Investment Management. The investment arm of the Norwegian bank in early 2025 paid $1.07 billion for a 45 percent stake in a 48-building logistics stable, most of which is in Southern California. Aware Super has a more diverse U.S. investment strategy. Last summer, the pension manager, along with development partner Lendlease, secured a $316 million construction loan forHabitat, a 454,000-square-foot, mixed-use district in Culver City. In late 2022, the Aware Super and Lendlease JV landed a $360 million loan for a 36-story, 834-unit multifamily development in Brooklyn. “Through deliberate sequencing we’re establishing our reputation and presence as a global asset owner,” Alek Misev, Aware Super’s head of property, said in reference to its new logistics platform with Goodman.

Title: Economy Candy: Three generations of sweets and success
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/economy-candy-custom-woocommerce/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T20:47:09Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog October 1, 2025 We recently got to visit Mitchell and Skye Cohen at Economy Candy to learn about the history of their business and how they use WooCommerce. While our team was in New York, we also filmed a short interview, which you can check out below or on our YouTube channel. Want the full story? Keep on reading for all of the sweet, sweet details of their success. 🍬🍭 Please note that some quotes have been edited for clarity and brevity. Economy Candy began in the 1930s as a penny sweets cart outside a shoe and hat repair shop in New York City. Since then, three generations of the Cohen family have turned the business into a Lower East Side mainstay — with the corner of Rivington and Essex named after Mitchell’s grandfather — and national distributor of goodies from around the world. Now, Mitchell Cohen and his wife, Skye Greenfield Cohen, continue that legacy. “Starting before he could even see over the counter, Mitchell would work with his dad behind the register standing on a milk crate, tallying bills and calculating the change in his head,” Skye shared. Skye has also continued an important tradition: ensuring that her husband continued the family business, just as Mitchell’s mother and grandmother had done for their husbands. Their most recent evolution included an upgraded ecommerce strategy in March of 2020. When they overhauled their website, which luckily happened just in time for Covid-19 closures, they also updated their store operations. Economy Candy brought nearly 2,500 SKUs into their online store, live syncing their inventory management, and began using a combination of shipping and local pickup options to keep their business going (and their customers happy) through the pandemic and beyond. Economy Candy has weathered significant worldwide and local catastrophes in its 88-year history, and yet, they’re still going strong. Their enduring presence is due in large part to their commitment to their customers, maintaining the accessibility of their products through all of the challenging times. Over the past five years, they’ve added nearly 500 new products to their inventory — which now boasts an astounding 2,500 different sweets and goodies. Getting to 2,500 SKUs, however, required an operational pivot: all of their inventory operations used to reside exclusively in Mitchell’s brain. “Up until the pandemic, all of Economy Candy’s inventory was stored in Mitchell’s head,” Skye shared. “Our staff had to memorize the prices of all 2,000+ items we carried because we were still using dumb cash registers where the price of each item had to be manually entered. In 2021 we took a leap into the 21st century and upgraded to Square digital registers.” Their modernization coincided with the pandemic, which exasperated the need for efficient (and online-friendly) inventory management. Not allowed to bring staff in-store, Mitchell and Skye moved all sales online, managing fulfillment themselves. In 2021, they added Square digital registers and implemented barcode scanning, using Thrive to sync in-store sales with their ecommerce business. Economy Candy has been online since the dawn of the millennium. In their hunt for a solution that didn’t feel restricted in functionality or growth, they switched platforms several times until 2015 — when they found WooCommerce. “When WooCommerce was presented to us, it was clear that limitations would no longer be an issue. Because WooCommerce is open source, there is no ceiling. There’s no limit to what you can do, what you can customize, what you can create. And it’s been great ever since.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy Their WooCommerce store is responsible for 20 to 25% of their total sales each year, with seasonal spikes in traffic around the holidays. Thrive sits between WooCommerce and Economy Candy’s other third-party tools, and syncs sales data for in-store purchases, online transactions, and ShipStation. They’ve also integrated the site with UPS, FedEx, Route, Mailchimp, Google, and Meta. With a total of 57 active plugins and custom code, Economy Candy manages a complex network of tools and services. “It’s incredible the way that WooCommerce is able to talk to all these different programs.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy One aspect that Mitchell and Skye love about WooCommerce is the breadth of options for customization — something that comes in handy when your products might melt during warmer seasons: “Shipping chocolate in the summer is tough. It is a challenge, but one thing that Woo has been great [for], there’s a myriad of popups and messages that you can easily set up.” “[For example,] I can set a warning,” noted Skye, “for anything that’s chocolate, put this text on that page so that the person ordering it knows that this is chocolate, there is a risk of melting. Do they want to add ice? Do they want to add cold packaging? So all those plugins [allow us to] set it and forget it… And it has really made shipping chocolate much less of a heartbreak.” Their focus on customer satisfaction has been the key to their success: “Economy Candy has survived for nearly 90 years on word of mouth,” Skye shared. “Of course, what ‘word of mouth’ means has changed a bit in the last century, from literal word of mouth to now including having our customers post about us on TikTok and Instagram and having a social media presence ourselves.” To inspire that organic promotion, they follow the rule of threes: If three people give the same feedback or request, they do their best to accommodate it. This often impacts their product and inventory decisions, from importing international sweets to making sure they stock candy from their oldest customers’ youth. They take a similar approach to new product decisions, considering the selection from the customer’s point of view: Would the customer be excited to see it in store, or has someone requested something similar? Is it a unique product that they haven’t seen before? Mitchell and Skye are also mindful of future generations of their audience. Their Gen Z staff members help them stay up to date on TikTok trends and viral sweets, such as Swedish candy, freeze-dried candy, and slime lickers. As the business grows, Economy Candy continues to play to WooCommerce’s strengths. Taking advantage of all of the customization options, Mitchell and Skye know that they can change direction whenever the need arises. “Being able to pivot without recreating your website from scratch every few years, which we used to do — now we’re making tweaks on an existing platform instead of starting from scratch, and that saves a lot of money, a lot of time.”— Mitchell Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy “With WooCommerce as the central foothold of our platform and adding pieces around that, … EconomyCandy.com is customized to what EconomyCandy.com needs to be for Economy Candy customers and for Economy Candy staff to be able to operate on the backend. We are able to put in all those custom functionalities that work for our specific business.” About Ship your WooCommerce orders with confidence, save on top carriers, and automate your processes with ShipStation.

Reports of a potential acquisition helped shares of a utility company power higher, while an agricultural sciences firm faced pressure after it announced a plan to separate into two independent entities. Major U.S. equities indexes recovered from early losses to end higher on the first trading day after a federal government shutdown took effect. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow eked out a 0.1% gain to finish at all-time highs. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4% to finish just short of its closing record. Find the full market summary from Investopedia here. Shares of renewable energy provider AES (AES) surged nearly 17%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock. The push higher followed reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), is in talks to buy AES. The deal could be worth around $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever. Pharmaceutical stocks and others in the healthcare sector extended their gains Wednesday, a day after Pfizer (PFE) became the first major drugmaker to comply with a push from the White House cut medication prices in the U.S. to the lower levels seen in other countries. According to media reports, other major pharma companies could follow Pfizer's lead and seek pricing deals with the Trump administration. Shares of Biogen (BIIB), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Eli Lilly (LLY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all ranked among the benchmark index's top performers Wednesday. Shares of memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology (MU) advanced close to 9%, along with hard drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC). The moves extended recent gains on anticipation they could benefit from growing demand for data storage to support AI. Corteva (CTVA) shares tumbled 9.1%, logging the S&P 500's weakest performance Wednesday, after the agricultural sciences firm announced a plan to split its crop protection and its seed businesses into two independent companies. The company expects the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2026. Shares of tech-focused research firm Gartner (IT) fell 4.5%. Although the U.S. federal government accounts for less than 5% of Gartner's revenue, the government shutdown weighed on sentiment across the advisory industry. Gartner stock has also faced pressure stemming from concerns about how AI could disrupt the research business. Interpublic Group (IPG) stock lost 5% on Wednesday, reversing gains posted in the prior session after German biotech giant Bayer (BAYRY) named IPG as the exclusive creative and media partner for its consumer health business. IPG and fellow marketing firm Omnicom (OMC) announced that the regulatory approval process for their intended merger remains in progress and that they expect the deal to close by year-end. Omnicom shares also slipped 5%.

October 01, 2025 16:18 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=169949&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Title: AI Stocks Have Fueled the Bull Market for 3 Years—Will the Momentum Continue?

The U.S. stock market entered the final quarter of the year near record highs, boosted by soaring AI stocks that have become increasingly critical for the market's performance. Most of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year are directly tied to the AI boom. Data storage companies Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) have seen their shares nearly triple in value this year, while Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP), two software firms that have excelled at translating AI capabilities into revenue, have more than doubled. And despite a rough start to 2025, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are up since the start of the year. The artificial intelligence boom has been the primary source of fuel propelling the bull market of the past few years. As such, the performance of most investment portfolios is increasingly tethered to the performance of AI stocks. The Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the S&P 500, and thus have an outsized influence over the broader market’s performance. And these stocks, experts say, are increasingly tied to AI. The Mag 7's “share prices are a daily referendum on whether AI is considered hype or reality,” wrote Christopher Gannatti, Global Head of Research at WisdomTree, in a recent blog post. They “are priced as if AI is not just a growth driver, but the growth driver,” Gannatti added. As such, the investments, deals and optimism propelling the AI trade are likely to be pivotal for the entire stock market in the coming months. Massive infrastructure investment from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) has been a primary source of fuel for the AI rally. Their spending has caused revenue at chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) to explode, and underpinned the narrative that AI demand is insatiable. The hyperscalers will all update investors on their capital expenditure plans when they report quarterly results in late October and early November. Alphabet and Meta each lifted their capex forecasts in their most recent earnings reports, while Microsoft and Amazon said they would continue to invest heavily in infrastructure throughout the year. Tax changes codified by the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which empowers companies to immediately write off infrastructure investments, could give them reason to lift capex further. Experts note immediate write-offs should boost free cash flow, allowing companies to invest even more in AI. Hyperscalers have had a few months to figure out how the bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, will affect their finances and, thus, investments. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers, including Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV), will spend $490 billion on infrastructure, up from their prior estimate of $420 billion. “We expect the major hyperscalers to reflect this incremental spend in guidance discussions during 3Q results,” the analysts wrote. Unexpected increases to capex guidance could reinforce Wall Street’s bullishness on the semiconductor, software, and energy companies benefiting most from the AI buildout. “We’re seeing a bit of an evolution” in the drivers of the AI rally, Gannatti told Investopedia. “It kind of started with the hyperscalers—Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet—saying, ‘We have a certain amount of cash flow. We’re going to make investments.’” Today, Gannatti says, AI companies are investing in one another, and using those investments to buy goods and services from each other. The most notable example of this was announced last month, when OpenAI committed to deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems to train and run its next-generation models. In return, Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as capacity comes online, effectively subsidizing the start-up's infrastructure expenses. “So there’s a bit of circularity,” says Gannatti, who notes there’s a risk to these sorts of deals. “None of these things are guaranteed,” he said, including OpenAI’s commitment to spend $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud computing services over the next five years. “If the business environment changes, the music might need to stop—not necessarily forever, but for a while.” Investors have worried about an AI bubble for quite some time, and the rally faces the risk that AI sentiment sours, weighing on investment and depressing stock valuations. So far, tech companies have been able to show investors enough benefit from AI to keep Wall Street comfortable with their spending, said Gannatti. “But you feel like you’re always one earnings cycle away from a negative interpretation of a certain announcement,“ the kind of less-than-ideal development that throws cold water on a red-hot market, he added. Several events this year have briefly appeared to be this watershed moment. In January, investors caught wind of Chinese start-up DeepSeek’s super-efficient reasoning model, briefly calling into question the wisdom of Silicon Valley’s AI spending. And AI stocks swooned over the summer when an MIT study found that 95% of corporate generative AI pilot projects failed to deliver any material return on investment. Yet, on every occasion, investors have shaken off the panic and continued to pile into AI stocks. There are reasons to be optimistic that today’s AI boom is more resilient than the bubbles to which it is often compared. “The positive is it’s not being financed by debt, at least not yet,” said Gannatti. “So it's not like the fiber optic buildouts in, say, 1999 and 2000, where the companies didn't even have the fundamentals.” Instead, the companies funding the AI buildout have some of the biggest businesses, healthiest balance sheets, and deepest pockets of any companies on earth. Their hugely profitable non-AI businesses could mitigate the fallout of a shift in sentiment toward AI.

Title: Morgan Stanley: Adobe’s Future at Risk Due to AI

Morgan Stanley has downgraded Adobe’s stock rating, cutting its price target for the software giant amidst a perceived inability to stand out amidst the rise of generative AI. According to a report from The Street, top Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss noted a growing gap between Adobe’s AI development (and promises) and reported revenue in its Digital Media division. “Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio,” Weiss writes in his report. The full report notes that Adobe’s revenue which it can tie directly to its AI-based efforts has been lagging, and monetization is going slowly. Compounding issues are growing from competitors like Canva, Google, and Meta, who all have introduced AI-based features that they can more directly tie to revenue growth. As a result, Morgan Stanley lowered their price target for Adobe from $520 to $450. It doesn’t look like it’s close to even hitting that lower mark, however, as the stock has been steadily falling in the past couple of weeks. It hit $353 per share on September 24 and sits at $344 on October 1. Adobe’s current weakened situation is likely a product of its own making. For the last year, Adobe has been shouting loudly about its AI development and the power of its in-house generative AI platform, Firefly. However, after updates and iterations, Firefly remains significantly behind competitors in terms of usefulness. While its select subject and remove tools have become a lot better over the last couple of months, for most of the year, its generative tools have been downright ghastly, resulting in Eldritch nightmares that don’t solve the problems they should. Its AI-based generative video tool is still far from being usable. The AI situation at Adobe has been so behind that the company recently opened up its platform to use other Generative AI tools — most recently Nano Banana — diminishing the value of its “responsible” AI to the degree that Adobe seems less concerned with it now than ever, especially as pressure mounts to make good on its AI-based revenue promises. In June, Adobe finally started tracking generative AI use through its apps via credits, which will very likely be an indicator that Adobe can use to tie AI to revenue. But if those numbers aren’t high and showing an upward trend, investors still won’t be happy. That’s tricky for the software company, as the main users of its Digital Media division are still artists, many of whom are less than happy with the proliferation of generative AI that has been trained on human work, effectively stealing knowledge so it can be sold back to them. Adobe is not wholly beloved by its customers either, who regularly clamor for someone else to step in and give Adobe competition. Its recent foray into social media network Bluesky is the best example of how Adobe’s customers feel as the company was hit with so much backlash after joining that it was effectively forced off the platform.

October 1, 2025 3:00pm by Barry Ritholtz At The Money: The Flood of New ETFs (October 1, 2025) There will be nearly 1,000 new ETFs issued this year. Most of these are NOT the usual low-cost passive indices, but tend to be complex, expensive active funds in an ETF wrapper. These include leveraged directional bets, options, derivatives, and a whole raft of exotic strategies. Full transcript below. ~~~ About this week’s guest: Dave Nadig is President and Director of Research at ETF.com, and he shares with us how investors should navigate all of these new products. Dave helped design and market some of the first exchange-traded funds. He is the author of “A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds” for the CFA Institute.

And find the entire musical playlist of all the songs I have used on At the Money on Spotify TRANSCRIPT: Barry Ritholtz: There were 600 new ETFs launched in the first eight months of 2025. And it’s gonna get worse because so many more ETFs are coming out next year. The growth has been explosive. What does this mean for investors? I have the perfect person to discuss this with. Dave Nadig is president and head of research at ETF.com. He has been tracking the ETF industry pretty much since his its beginning and is well known as an expert in the space. So Dave, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on. Most ETF assets are and will likely continue to be cheap, index based products. That’s the legacy for investors: Low cost beta. Is this the future of ETFs or are we going in a different direction? Dave Nadig: I think most of the money is gonna continue to flow into low cost asset allocation targets, right? The S&P 500 broad bonds, broad commodities at very, very cheap institutional prices. It’s just hard to beat that. It’s one of the best deals going in asset management in the investing world. And so whether you’re an individual mom and pop investor just trading your own account, or whether you’re the Harvard endowment, anything in between. Cheap beta is still probably gonna be important to your portfolio, and ETFs are gonna remain the best wrapper for that experience. However, this industry is not gonna take that lying down and desperately wants to make money. Most of the new products, the new launches you talked about, the 600 will probably have 800, 900 by the end of the year. Almost all of those products are very expensive. Doesn’t mean some of them aren’t good, but they’re all very expensive. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about that. New products are coming out with what you described as quote, insanely high fees that the big revenue winners are likely not the firms you think of when someone says ETF at a cocktail party. What does this mean for investors? What does this mean for the industry? Are there really massive profits to be had here? Dave Nadig: There are pretty huge profits to be had here. And if you look at where I, I like to look at revenue based on flow. Meaning like last month, X amount of money came in, what was the revenue implied by that money and the implied revenue of the industry? Now has, you know, probably about 25% of the implied revenue from Flow is going to products that cost over 1%. (Really?!) So that means there are a lot of investors buying products that cost over 1%. And the reason that’s an issue for investors is not that nothing is worth that fee, but that what’s getting launched tends to be very speculative. We’re not talking about core investing, building blocks; we’re talking about ETFs that use leverage or ETFs that use the derivatives markets to shape your pattern of returns to get you more income than you might otherwise be able to, e.g., “Selling volatility” Those types of products are expensive and while they may be useful like, like a really sharp knife in the drawer can be really useful when you got that chicken bone you gotta get through. It’s not a one size fits all thing. I have some concern that individual investors see the marketing from the industry, which is really exclusively focused on those expensive products and gets sort of suckered into ’em. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what, what is transformative? What is innovative in ETFs over the past few years? What trends do you see shaping 2026 and beyond? What is the biggest new type of ETF that’s coming out? Dave Nadig: There’s really three buckets of, of hot development from a, from a what could you as an investor target. Crypto we have to talk about. Not only do we now have, um, hundreds of billions of dollars tracking crypto in various capacities, whether it’s spot Bitcoin, which is where most of those flows have gone, but now we’re talking about Ethereum and Solana. We’re talking about stake diversions where you’re taking your Solana and you’re putting it into a contract to earn fees off of or earn interest off of it. That ecosystem of crypto products is going to get very complex very quickly. The SEC has put out accelerated listing standards; default listing standards, which will allow probably the next 10 to 20 coins on the market cap list to be launched as spot ETFs. So those will all be launched within the next six to 12 months before you it gonna be a free for all Barry Ritholtz: Before you move off crypto. I have to ask about BlackRock’s Ibit – it was 5 billion at launch. It’s something like 82 billion already. Is this the fastest ever asset accumulator of any ETF that’s been launched? Dave Nadig: It’s pretty close if it’s not the winner. I, I certainly think on a, on a pure dollar basis, uh, I can’t think of anything that has had that kind of ramp. GLD when it first came out was one of the first to a billion and then the first to 5 billion, and that broke a lot of records. I think Ibit and Bitcoin as a class has really kind of blown all those things out of the water and it’s been, it’s been, I think, beneficial for the most part, and an orderly process. I think having these Bitcoin ETFs has helped investors understand it. Um, I’m hearing from bigger as bigger institutions, bigger advisors, they love the ETF because it solves all of their custody issues, right? Everything stays in the same account. They don’t have to worry about having on chain assets. So while crypto purists may not be into it, I think the average investor is way better suited to get their little bit of crypto exposure in that ETF wrapper. And, and you mentioned what the SEC is permitting, not just in crypto, but across the boards. I, I read your regular writings and one of the things you had said is. We have a “Incredibly permissive launch environment.” What does this mean in terms of the sort of things we can see in ETFs, either with leverage two x three x in verse two x? What, what does this permissive environment mean for what ETFs are gonna get launched? Dave Nadig: It means we’re gonna get a lot of ’em. We’re gonna launch “all the things,” as I like to say. (All the things!) Uh, the, the, the biggest thing we’ve had is this move towards single stock ETFs. And, and for people who might be confused by that, it’s not that you’re buying an Apple ETF to invest in just Apple ’cause you can obviously just buy Apple to do that. You’re buying an Apple ETF that maybe gives you two x Apple exposure or minus. Two x apple exposure. So when it goes, you goes down, you go up, or you’re writing options on your Apple position so that you can get some extra income. Or you’re doing a combination of both so that you can only get, you know, you get 2X the upside and minus 1X the downside but with caps involved, ’cause you’re selling a lot of options along the way. Anyway you can imagine mixing and matching these kinds of patterns of returns. The combination of leverage. Income and protection around a single stock is going to be launched. If you think about it, we’ve got 500 stocks in the S&P 500. There are about six different flavors you can think of for each individual stock. That’s a couple thousand ETFs we’re gonna have to keep track of, assuming there’s only one of each flavor, and this industry loves to compete against each other. Legitimately, I think by this time next year, we could have several thousand more ETFs than we do right now. Barry Ritholtz: More ETFs than there are actually stocks. Dave Nadig: Huge already. They’re absolutely, I mean, we’ve been under, we haven’t had 5,000 stocks in the Wilshire in a long time. I think 3,500. 500 or so. We’re gonna see all those single stock products, which are, for the most part, trading vehicles, right? If you’re a day trader, there’s lots of value in there. If you are trying to, you know, monetize a long term position, there’s some value in those kinds of covered call strategies. They’re all very expensive. They’re very inappropriate for most long-term investor from an allocation perspective, but sharp, useful trading tools for a certain class of trader. Barry Ritholtz: I keep reading some of the things you’re penning about share class relief. Explain what this means and why this is another flood of new ETFs that are coming out. Dave Nadig: Let’s pick an example. Like DFA Dimensional was late to the ETF party, very well known sort of in the nineties for being one of those shops where you could only buy them through an advisor who’d gone through their coursework. They made the shift to convert some of their mutual funds to ETFs a couple years ago, and were very successful at it. Now, why didn’t they convert all of them? Because a lot of the DFA products end up in 401k plans. And if you’re in a 401k plan, that means you need to be able to get fractional shares, which is really easy in a mutual fund and impossible in an ETF. The only way to get the efficiencies of the ETF structure into those mutual funds is a share class: an ETF share class pointing at the same pool of assets. That’s how a lot of Vanguard ETFs are built. They had a patent, which is now expired. The SEC has 70 odd applications from other players in the industry to basically duplicate things the way Vanguard does. They’ve made it very clear that. Imminent, I would suggest by the end of the year, at the very latest, we’ll see this first one’s approved and that will then be a flood because that becomes a very, very simple boilerplate piece of paperwork to file a new share class and get it trading on NYSE, Nasdaq, or CBOE. We’ll just see a lot of those. I would suspect by the end of the year, we could have maybe a thousand of those individual share class ETFs turned on if all of the people who have filed. Converted all or share classed all of the things they could. It would be about five or 6,000 new ETFs. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really intriguing. I have to ask a question, and you’re the one who’s really schooled me on this. If mutual funds were created today, they probably wouldn’t be approved. Explain the problem with mutual funds and why ETFs are arguably so much superior. Dave Nadig: Well, the biggest problem with funds is their tax fairness. It’s the issue with a fund is that if you as a big investor, let’s say you own 20% of the Dave Mutual Fund and you decide I’m terrible and you want out, well, the mutual fund me has to now go sell a bunch of securities to give you back your 20% of my fund all that cash that you’re gonna want. That engenders generally a bunch of capital gains. Those capital gains now have to be distributed to. All the people who were left, the people you abandoned buried, they end up paying taxes ’cause you left because you created a capital gain for everybody. Now it’s not that those are taxes that would never be paid, it’s just you’re paying them earlier than you would otherwise ’cause you get to reduce your basis. So. Individual investors in a mutual fund can often get tax distributions through no fault of their own, through no action of their own, simply because other investors go in and out in an ETF. That simply doesn’t happen. So it is a simply a fairer mechanism. The ETF also brings other things that are helpful, like the ability to wash out some cap gains by doing so-called creation redemption or heartbeat trading. That’s a little feature of ETFs that makes them very tax efficient. And of course liquidity and transparency and all those other things. But the big reason mutual funds would probably get the kibosh today is they’re inherently less fair in terms of how they treat individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: Even if I don’t sell my mutual fund, but other people have, I incur capital gains. Dave Nadig: A hundred percent. Now you get, again, you get to change your basis. So when you go to sell, you’ll pay less tax gains. But I don’t know about you. I prefer paying taxes later, hopefully never, or maybe after I’m dead. But not today. Barry Ritholtz: Final question. It sounds like the future of ETFs are pretty much anything. Anything you wanna do, sometimes cheap. Always very liquid, but can be accomplished very well with an ETF. Is this the future of asset management? Dave Nadig: I think so, I think the ETF structure is the most efficient vehicle we’ve come up with for taking exposures and getting them traded on exchanges. It’s hard for me to see how we’re going to make it any more efficient tokenization crypto. Sometime down the line, we’ll replace some of what we’ve done with ETFs, but we’ll largely duplicate it and it will just do it in a different fashion. The, the ETF structure is where you’re going to probably get almost all of your exposures for the foreseeable future with some very strange edge cases. Things like some private credit or maybe some real estate that you can’t trade daily. There’ll be some edge cases. Everything else is gonna be an ETF. Barry Ritholtz: If we’re talking about the future of ETFs, we’re really talking about the future of asset allocation and investing. For the most part, the big money is in the low-cost passive indexes that charge 3, 4, 5 basis points. But the fastest growing space in ETF-world are active funds. Our alternative funds are all sorts of niche. Areas, some of which are pretty pricey, a hundred, 125 basis points. Directional bets leverage two x three x inverse bets. Those are really special use cases. Tread carefully if you’re playing in those spaces. Use ETFs for what they’re really good at: Getting you low-cost exposure to inexpensive indices. Tread lightly when you go into the pricier, wilder stuff, those are potential accidents waiting to happen. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/01/2025 10:14:25 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) are scrutinizing major corporations for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labor visa petitions after conducting mass layoffs of American employees. “In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years … At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for [thousands of] foreign workers,” Grassley and Durbin wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the United States. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers concluded. Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

H-1B Visa Holders are beneficial because they work for lower wages (bypassing the obnoxious and destructive minimum wage and union junk), thus reducing costs and lower prices, and benefitting the consumer. And when the consumer wins the economy wins and America wins. And the Left does not want America to win. 15 posted on 10/01/2025 10:29:20 AM PDT by Jim W N (MAGA by restoring the Gospel of the Grace of Christ (Jude 3) and our Free Constitutional Republic!)

And when the consumer wins the economy wins and America wins.

Grassley and Durbin are requesting information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators' inquiry comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population. Grassley and Durbin are longtime partners on H-1B visa reform and the lead authors of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. The senators wrote to the following companies, including two which have been, or are currently under investigation for discriminatory H-1B hiring and firing practices: Amazon, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Apple, which made at least four rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, laying off hundreds of workers. In fiscal year 2025, Apple applied for and received approval to hire 4,202 foreign H-1B employees. Cognizant Technology Solutions, which laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the United States. In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favored South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages. Deloitte, which laid off over a thousand employees in recent years. In fiscal year 2025, Deloitte applied for and received approval to hire 2,353 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a Journal of Business Ethics study found Deloitte pays H1-B visa holders 10 percent less than American citizens. Google, which laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years – including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 percent of its small team managers – despite enjoying records profits. In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees. JPMorgan Chase, which announced this year that it would conduct multiple rounds of layoffs affecting up to a thousand workers, despite enjoying record profits. Last month JPMorgan Chase laid off around 100 employees in its San Francisco office alone, despite reporting $15 billion in second quarter profits. In fiscal year 2025, JPMorgan Chase applied for and received approval to hire 2,440 foreign H-1B employees. Meta, which laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labeled it a “year of efficiency.” In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five percent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees. Microsoft, which laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits. Amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterized its actions as an “enigma of success.” In fiscal year 2025, Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favor of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders. Walmart, which cited “technological changes” when announcing it would terminate 1,500 employees earlier this year. In fiscal year 2025, Walmart applied for and received approval to hire 2,390 foreign H1-B employees.

Title: First Brands’ Fall Renews Concerns Over Murky Trade Finance
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/first-brands-fall-renews-concerns-over-murky-trade-finance-11759335358613.html

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- When the auto-parts supplier First Brands Group filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, one name popped up in the documents again and again: Raistone. The little-known firm helps businesses secure short-term financing as they wait for customer payments to come through or seek to delay paying suppliers. On Tuesday, the New York-based company let go dozens of its workers as the deals it worked on for First Brands came under scrutiny. The collapse of First Brands is only the most recent instance of a firm like Raistone facilitating apparently low-risk transactions that have led to problems for companies and lenders in what is known as trade finance. Late last year, a Raistone competitor, Stenn Technologies, collapsed in dramatic fashion after promoting mundane corporate lending products that proved to be anything but. The biggest bust in the industry came in 2021, when Greensill Capital filed for insolvency after channeling bank deposits and insurance funds into short-term loans to risky companies, ultimately contributing to the forced sale of Credit Suisse Group AG. Raistone has a working familiarity with these past problems. It offered to take on stranded clients of Stenn, and the founder of Raistone, Dave Skirzenski, was one of the first employees at Greensill. He left that firm years before it collapsed, and there are no allegations of wrongdoing against either Raistone or First Brands. A few of Raistone’s workers previously held positions at Stenn, according to a review of their LinkedIn profiles. The links between these disconnected corporate crashes underscore the questions surrounding the tools and platforms that offer companies easy access to short-term corporate financing, often tied to some promised future revenue. While intermediaries like Raistone and Greensill aim to make these markets more efficient and available to a wider array of businesses, they can end up obscuring some of the risks for borrowers, lenders and even the platforms themselves. The innovation in trade finance is “supposed to be good, but oftentimes, those financial innovations are being taken advantage of and companies kind of hide information, take on more risk,” said Ben Lourie, a professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine’s business school. “Sometimes that risk explodes,” he added. Raistone and First Brands both declined to comment. Warning Signals Regulators and accounting experts have sounded alarms for years about the growth of off-balance sheet financing techniques that companies use to manage their short-term cash flow. Transactions between investment-grade companies and lenders carry low risk, but cracks can emerge for businesses on shakier financial footing. The funding for these deals has largely come from asset managers and insurance companies, rather than the banks that used to provide it, creating additional visibility problems for investors and regulators. In 2022, after the collapse of Greensill, US accounting rulemakers required companies to disclose the size and key terms of one kind of financing offered by Greensill called supply chain financing, which generally involves taking out short-term loans to pay suppliers. Even with the new rules, though, many of First Brands’ creditors felt they were left in the dark leading up to the bankruptcy. The court filings this week are providing many lenders with the first real glimpse at what went wrong with First Brands, which saw the value of its loans drop by more than half in a matter of weeks after concerns began to circulate about its off-balance sheet financing. The Michigan-based company, which owns car parts brands such as Carter fuel pumps and Trico wiper blades, was thought to have about $6 billion in debt. But when it filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night, there were over $10 billion in outstanding liabilities, and just $1 billion to $10 billion of assets. The company is owned by a businessman who kept a low profile, Patrick James, and it channeled much of its financing through a network of intermediaries owned by James. Short-Term Cash While there’s no indication of wrongdoing, a newly appointed board committee is now investigating the company’s use of roughly $2.3 billion of off-balance sheet financing, Chief Restructuring Officer Charles Moore said in a court filing. Some of the inventory backing these facilities “may have been commingled” with collateral securing a separate asset-backed loan facility. The declaration filed on Tuesday morning showed that $2.3 billion of First Brands’ liabilities were tied to a practice known as factoring that can turn expected future income, like outstanding receipts, into immediate cash — a sort of corporate payday loan. An industry group, the Secured Finance Network, reported this week that the total funds in use in factoring rose 13% between the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025. First Brands also owed another $800 million to creditors that offered supply-chain finance, the borrowing tool companies use to pay suppliers. Many of these arrangements ran through Raistone, which is listed as the point of contact for several of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, including the three largest, with combined claims of over half a billion dollars. While Raistone’s precise relationship to these creditors is not detailed in the documents, its website describes it as an administrator originating and placing such debt with its client investors. Unsecured Creditors Raistone was founded in 2017 by Skirzenski, who, in a 2020 interview, said that he imagined it as “the Amazon Web Services of trade finance,” standing in between the various players in the market. It advertises its services to companies that want to “get paid quickly without taking on debt,” and to investors looking to offer funding with a “short tenor,” “low default rates” and “no mark-to-market risk.” The company says it has offered nearly $15 billion in financing to date. While Raistone is typically only the intermediary in these transactions, it is also separately listed as one of First Brands’ unsecured creditors, for an “undetermined amount” tied to both factoring and supply-chain finance. Skirzenski would have been familiar with this mix of businesses at Greensill Capital, which he joined in 2013, according to his personal LinkedIn profile. After he left in 2017, Greensill grew into one of the hottest startups in the fintech industry, with a big investment from SoftBank Group Corp., ties to the highest ranks of the British government and a fleet of corporate jets. Greensill’s high profile founder, Lex Greensill, promoted the safe nature of his business lending against future cashflow, which appeared to be secured by the invoices themselves. However, it turned out that much of the money was lent against predicted future income, rather than actual invoices. This became a particular problem because Greensill’s business was largely concentrated on a handful of risky companies. Some of the same issues cropped up at Stenn, another UK trade finance fintech, though it also faced accusations of faked client lists and fraud. When Stenn went under last year, Raistone put up a website for “former Stenn clients left looking for an alternative” and promised interest rates as low as 6%. --With assistance from Lucca de Paoli.

Title: Yahoo Fantasy Basketball: Draft strategy for new High Score format

Manage your account ... Welcome to Yahoo's High Score fantasy basketball. If you've been playing fantasy hoops for a while, get ready to unlearn some old habits. This game isn't about nightly grind and steady production — it's about chasing peak performances and embracing the fun and chaos of the NBA week. You can learn more in my High Score 101, but the rules are simple: Your weekly score is calculated using only the single-best fantasy performance from each of your six starters. That’s it. A player can have three bad games and one amazing game, and you only get the points from the amazing one. This changes everything. [High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league] Now, let's explore tips to help you in your High Score drafts — I also have in-season strategy, when you’re ready to dive deeper. As a reminder, the High Score scoring format is as follows: Points: 1 point Rebounds: 1 point Assists: 2 points Blocks: 3 points Steals: 3 points And here's how the starting lineup breaks down: Guard Guard Frontcourt Frontcourt Frontcourt FLEX/UTIL There are also four bench spots. 101 on the format In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Join a league now With High Score's streamlined and positionless format, there are just two guard spots, three frontcourt spots and a single flex/utility spot. There's no need to worry about filling every position (PG, SG, SF, PF or C) like traditional fantasy basketball formats. This gives you way more freedom to build your lineup your way — whether you want to stack up on guards, bulk up on versatile forwards or mix and match based on your favorite draft strategy. Or, better yet … Drafting players with both guard and frontcourt eligibility is a savvy move in High Score. With only 30 of these versatile options available within the top 150, you get the freedom to easily adjust your lineup when injuries or rest days pop up. Here's the list of players with dual eligibility whom I’d target: Scottie Barnes Jaylen Brown Amen Thompson Desmond Bane Josh Hart Dyson Daniels Paul George Cam Thomas Brandon Ingram Bennedict Mathurin Devin Vassell Shaedon Sharpe Norman Powell Andrew Wiggins Bradley Beal Christian Braun Ayo Dosunmu Nickeil Alexander-Walker Bilal Coulibaly Jaylen Wells Quentin Grimes Kyshawn George Prioritize these players on draft day for an additional edge in High Score. Let's start with one of the biggest changes you need to know: Guards are more valuable than ever. The scoring updates in High Score are a massive boost for playmakers and perimeter defenders. Assists are now worth a full 2 points each, a big jump from the previous 1.5, and turnovers no longer deduct points. This is a game-changer. This scoring tweak turns high-assist guards into prized fantasy assets. Trae Young and Cade Cunningham — two high-assist, high-turnover guards — are even better in High Score. But it doesn't stop there. Steals are worth a hefty 3 points, and guards tend to rack up steals at a higher rate than most frontcourt players. So, a guard who drops between 6-10 assists, plus a steal and no turnovers to worry about, is already giving you a huge point boost before you even count their points and rebounds. This doesn't mean you should ignore big men entirely. In fact, it makes certain types of frontcourt players even more valuable. Guys who are the hub of their offense, like Paolo Banchero, Domantas Sabonis or Alperen Şengün, also get a bump in High Score. Your draft plan should prioritize these assist-heavy players, whether they bring the ball up the court or facilitate from the high post. In other formats, a player who misses a game or two can be a weekly disaster. That fear leads to players with injury risk, like Joel Embiid, sliding down draft boards. In High Score, that risk practically vanishes. Since you only need one great game from a starter each week, "load management" and minor absences become far less concerning. Think about Embiid. He averages over 50 fantasy points per game when he plays, but his availability concerns often push him beyond the fifth round in traditional drafts. In High Score, he’s a first-round talent, no question. All you need is one of his signature dominant performances per week to get elite production from that roster spot. He can play once, drop a 50-burger and you're set for the week. This mindset applies throughout the draft. Look for players who have week-winning potential. Jalen Green is a perfect mid-round example. He's known for being inconsistent, but he’s also capable of erupting for a massive scoring night at any moment. In other formats, his duds would frustrate you. Here, you only care about the peak. One 40-point game is all it takes to make him a valuable asset. Your goal is to build a roster full of players who can go off, not just show up. These are reliable, night-in and night-out contributors who grab rebounds and block a couple of shots. In many fantasy formats, they provide a stable floor. In High Score, the Rudy Gobert types aren't as valuable. The scoring system devalues one of their primary contributions: Rebounds are now worth just 1 point compared to 1.2 previously. While Gobert might have a spike game with 20+ rebounds or four blocks, the overall offensive game for traditional frontcourt players is limited. You generally know what you're getting — a low-end double-double. That predictable production just doesn't move the needle in a format where you're chasing explosive point totals. Focus on bigs who are more involved in the offense or who contribute across multiple categories, not just the traditional big-man stats. Let someone else in your league draft these "safe" centers. High Score features smaller rosters (10 players in total, including four bench spots), which might seem restrictive, but it actually gives you incredible freedom in the later rounds of your draft. You don't need to waste those final picks on safe, low-upside players just to fill out your roster. Instead, it’s time to go big-game hunting. Use your late-round picks to swing for the fences. Target volatile players who have the potential for spike performances. Rookies with a clear path to scoring, like Wizards rookie Tre Johnson, are my ideal targets. He might be inconsistent early on, but his role is expected to grow and he has the talent to deliver a 30-point game out of nowhere. The beauty of this strategy lies in its low-risk nature. If your lottery ticket doesn't pan out, the short bench makes it an easy decision to drop him for a hot player on the waiver wire. You're not tied to your late-round picks. Take a chance on a player who could have a few huge weeks. Those are the swings that can separate you from the rest of the league. While chasing points and assists is crucial, don't forget about the defensive side of the ball. Steals and blocks — affectionately known as "stocks" in fantasy basketball — are both worth 3 points apiece. These stats can be random, but they add up quickly and can be the difference in a close matchup. Prioritizing players who contribute on both ends of the floor is a savvy move. Guards who are elite defenders, like Derrick White, are incredibly valuable. He can fill up the stat sheet with points and assists while also adding a couple of steals and a block, providing a well-rounded and high-scoring fantasy line. In the frontcourt, look for versatile defenders who can do a bit of everything. Players like the Thompson twins (Amen and Ausar) are great examples. They have the athleticism to block shots and the quick hands to rack up steals, giving you multiple avenues to score fantasy points. If you miss out on some of the top-tier offensive stars, pivoting to elite defensive players is a fantastic way to build a competitive and balanced roster, should you miss out on some of the high-volume scorers.

Title: Contrarians Only: A “Flash” Sale On Our Top AI Dividend

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. We contrarians live for the “one-off” shots at extra income (or gains!) our favorite AI dividend plays throw our way. One of these “special situations” just landed in our lap: A shot at buying a megatrend-powered 7.6% dividend that’s rarely cheap. And we’re picking it up for a song. It’s a long-time holding of our Contrarian Income Report advisory, and it’s sitting right in the tracks of the surging AI buildout. In fact, it may be the last “cheap” AI play on the board! This one’s dropped from trading for more than its portfolio is worth to a lot less. As you can see, this fund dropped from trading 6% above its net asset value (NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio) to 7.1% below, as of this writing. It’s a huge drop, and it stands out because, as you can see above, this fund, the 7.6%-yielding Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), is rarely cheap for long. UTF’s latest tour in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio started in November 2020, and this reliable utility fund has been humming away since, handing us a 7.8% yield on our original buy, plus a monthly payout that’s rolled in like clockwork. That’s exactly what we bought it to do. And it’s handed us a 41% total return in that time, too. And now we have a shot at buying it cheaper than we did five years ago! Let me put all of this in dollars and cents for you. In the past year, UTF’s average premium has been 1.8%. If the discount reverts to that level, price upside of around 10% is on the table here. And that’s before we factor in the growth of its portfolio. Let’s talk about that now. We bought UTF in late 2020 because its utility-stock holdings—including big players like NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (CO)—are essentially “bond proxies.” When rates fall, as they did then, utilities rise. Nowadays, we have a similar setup. As we discussed in last week’s article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI’s limitless power demand. Let’s take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That’s just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF’s total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% “discount gap.” This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It’s all about investor sentiment. And we’re happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF’s management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a “transferable rights offering” on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the “record date”—September 22—you get one “right” to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here’s how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock’s average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund’s average price is below 90% of its NAV—again, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio—the price will be set at 90% of NAV. That “floor” helps limit the offer’s downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you’ll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don’t pick up. If you don’t want to get in on the action here, that’s fine—you can sell your rights—hence the “transferable” in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S’s website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let’s look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS’s discount deepened on the offer’s announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF’s AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management’s ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they’ll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar—and ride its closing “discount gap” higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: CoreWeave Stock To $250?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CoreWeave stock (NASDAQ:CRWV) exhibited an impressive performance increase of 12% on September 30, 2025, following the announcement of a groundbreaking $14.2 billion partnership with Meta Platforms, affirming the organization’s position as a leading AI infrastructure provider. The seven-year agreement with Meta, which extends through December 2031 with the potential for expansion into 2032, signifies a strategic diversification success for CoreWeave. Having been reliant on Microsoft for roughly 70% of its revenue, this partnership fundamentally alters CoreWeave’s risk related to client concentration while illustrating the scalability of its specialized GPU infrastructure model. The partnership guarantees Meta access to CoreWeave’s Nvidia GB300 server racks, each outfitted with 72 of Nvidia’s advanced Blackwell AI GPUs, establishing CoreWeave as Meta’s infrastructure partner for forthcoming AI workloads. This agreement comes on the heels of CoreWeave’s recent $6.5 billion expansion with OpenAI, raising the total contracted revenue with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and creating a varied blue-chip client portfolio. We elaborate further on this development and CoreWeave’s valuation in the sections below. That being said, if you’re looking for a less volatile investment than holding a single stock like CRWV, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has realized returns surpassing 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; avoiding a tumultuous experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In addition, refer to – Wait For A Dip To Buy Hims & Hers Health Stock Meta’s dedication grants CoreWeave unparalleled revenue visibility and confirms the company’s specialized “AI Hyperscaler” strategy. As Meta actively enhances its investments in AI infrastructure—with capital expenditures anticipated between $66-72 billion for 2025—CoreWeave becomes an essential infrastructure provider for one of the largest AI spenders in the tech industry. The agreement bolsters CoreWeave’s competitive advantage against hyperscale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud by showcasing that specialized AI infrastructure can command premium pricing and foster client loyalty. CoreWeave’s current market capitalization of approximately $70 billion and its current revenue base of $3.5 billion indicate that the company trades at roughly 19 times trailing revenue—a compelling multiple considering its rapid growth trajectory. For context, CoreWeave's revenue is projected to increase over 3.5 times, nearing approximately $18 billion by 2027. Does this imply the company’s valuation will decrease to under 4 times sales, assuming the stock price stays stable? We do not think so. Even at a more conservative 8 times revenues, the company’s valuation would likely surpass $145 billion, representing more than a doubling from current levels in the next three years. Indeed, this valuation seems conservative when compared to other high-growth technology stocks that trade at considerably higher revenue multiples. For instance, among AI and Data Infrastructure Leaders, Snowflake trades at around 18x revenue despite slower 28% growth rates, while Palantir commands a 124x revenue multiple with a 39% growth rate. In the realm of High-Growth SaaS Companies, Palo Alto Networks trades at a 15x revenue multiple, and HubSpot at a 10x multiple. There are numerous other comparable examples. CoreWeave’s recent achievements authenticate our previous forecasts of substantial upside potential, with the stock rising 47% over the last month and more than tripling since its IPO in March 2025 at $40 per share. The company’s revenue growth of 206% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching $1.213 billion with 62% adjusted EBITDA margins, showcases significant operational leverage at scale. With a contracted backlog of $30.1 billion offering multi-year revenue predictability and nearly 50% anticipated to be realized within 24 months, CoreWeave presents investors with both growth and certainty—an unusual pairing in high-growth technology stocks. The partnership with Meta reinforces CoreWeave’s thesis as the specialized infrastructure layer driving the AI revolution, positioning the company for sustained growth as enterprise AI adoption accelerates across various verticals. Naturally, we could be incorrect in our evaluations, and investors should carefully consider the risks prior to investing in CRWV stock. The primary risks associated with CoreWeave revolve around its financial stability and market standing. Specifically, the company confronts substantial challenges stemming from fierce competition with major cloud providers and the possibility of market cyclicality in AI spending. From an operational perspective, CoreWeave has a -29% net margin and a $15 billion debt burden necessary for significant infrastructure investments, compounded by a critical customer concentration risk with major clients such as OpenAI. It’s important to recognize that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What accounts for this success? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a dynamic means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when the markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Pseudonymous X user Buzzlamic Jihad, who is called Buzz by his friends and family, told Decrypt that he hopes to address Aptos’ image problem and position it as a premium stablecoin network—harking back to the original Libra vision from Facebook in which Aptos was founded. He said that one way he aims to do this is by leveraging his personal connections with the co-founders of the President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, two of whom were mentors to the shitposter. "Buzz is an inventor and true Aptos missionary through and through,” Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at Aptos, told Decrypt. “I'm excited for him to come on board as an advisor to expand everyone's imagination of what is truly possible only on Aptos.” Aptos looking good here https://t.co/eTQrNlu1ga — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) September 14, 2025 Back in February, Buzz was partly responsible for a 17% pump for Aptos' APT token as the crypto community started to notice the memes he had been posting for months. The then-little-known social media user had been spamming “Aptos lookin’ good here,” “sidelined?” and “motion not priced in yet” in unwavering support for the layer-1 blockchain. These phrases have since become canonical crypto memes, with major crypto figures and companies embracing them. The buzz, pardon the pun, was so effective that Pampati told Decrypt in May it helped to revive developer interest in the network, in an unexpected display of the power of memes. Aptos looking good here This is just the last 24h pic.twitter.com/pagwYwZ1nD — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) February 16, 2025 At the time, people wondered how a seemingly random X user could have such a large impact. It turns out Buzz has a history in growth marketing, specializing in Facebook advertising, and claims to have generated millions with this venture. During that period, Buzz told Decrypt, he was mentored by Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, successful Facebook marketers who went on to co-found World Liberty Financial. At one point, Buzz said he lived with the pair in Puerto Rico and was briefly their business partner. Given his history with Facebook, now Meta, Buzz explained that he was immediately attracted to Aptos as it was formed by developers from Libra—a now-defunct stablecoin project led by Facebook. The deeper he dug, the more he liked about Aptos, and he started posting about it under the pseudonym Buzzlamic Jihad. After the February pump, Buzz claims he was offered a role in marketing at Aptos but turned it down. Over the coming months, he continued conversations with the Aptos team and has now signed a deal to become an advisor. In many ways, Buzz joining Aptos as an advisor is comparable to if meme stock influencer Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill joined GameStop—a rumor that once circulated on the internet. As the possibility of joining Aptos emerged, Buzz reached out to Folkman after years of not being in contact and told him, “Let’s run it back.” He helped connect Folkman with Aptos CEO Avery Ching, with the pair meeting at the White House crypto summit in March. Following this interaction, and without further help from Buzz, World Liberty Financial agreed to list its USD1 stablecoin on Aptos—which was announced in October at Token2049 in Singapore. BREAKING: @DonaldJTrumpJr & @ZachWitkoff just announced that @worldlibertyfi's USD1 is coming to @Aptos as the first Move based deployment. Our teams share a united mission of building the best financial infrastructure for 🇺🇸 and the world. Much more to come… 🦅🌐 https://t.co/DjxBvviJts pic.twitter.com/0P3YfSaY63 — avery.apt 🇺🇸 (@AveryChing) October 1, 2025 But this is just the beginning, Buzz told Decrypt. He intends to continue to leverage his relationship with the World Liberty Financial team to attract “net new buyers” to Aptos, fix its image, and position it as a premium stablecoin network. He went on to hint at bigger potential collaborations to come, although nothing is set in stone. “I think it's very relevant right now because you see chains like Plasma, they’re doing very well. Everyone was talking about them. Now you even have Circle, they’re launching the Tempo blockchain,” Buzz said, referencing the Plasma stablecoin network. “They’re basically doing Libra 2.0 … so the idea is validated. Aptos has the technology, it’s just frustrating that they don’t have the right messaging.” Now officially working for Aptos, Buzz hopes to have a direct hand in fixing this messaging. He also told Decrypt that he has some “bigger goals” which, if he achieves, he will be paid more for. That’s not to mention that he’s requested that he be paid entirely in APT tokens, as a sign of his belief in the network. After making his name by asking people if they’re sidelined, Buzz is finally no longer sidelined himself. “I am trying to community takeover,” Buzz told Decrypt. “That started as a meme, but as it progressed, I’m like, ‘Maybe it's actually possible. Could I actually do this?’,” he said, adding, “This isn’t a joke anymore. I’m actually working on it.” “It’s lookin' good here,” he finished.

Title: These are UBS's 10 highest-conviction stock picks in the hottest corner of the market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been another big year for tech in 2025. The broader tech, media, and telecommunications sector is one of the hottest corners of the market, and UBS shared its top picks this week. Within the S&P 500, tech stocks are up 20% year-to-date, while communications services stocks are up 22%. That handily outpaces the broader index, which is up just 13% from levels at the start of the year. In a note to clients, analysts at UBS highlighted 10 buy-rated stocks within the two sectors, which represented the bank's "highest-conviction calls" in that segment of the market. The calls also reflected companies where UBS had a "differentiated view" or proprietary data that supported its bullish call, analysts said. Here are the top stocks on the bank's radar: Ticker: NIQ Year-to-date performance: -16% Predicted upside: +56% Analyst reasoning: "Following its 2021 transformation, including ~$920m in investments ($400m in technology, $520m across deals, and Fetch), NIQ is positioned for ~5% organic CC revenue growth (2024-27E). We model adjusted EBITDA margin improving +550bps to 24.1% by 2027E, driven by cost efficiencies and equity quality enhancements." Ticker: DIS Year-to-date performance: +2% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "We remain bullish on Disney shares and continue to view parks as a value driver (which should improve as new attractions/cruise capacity comes online)," analysts wrote. "This supports our view that Disney can grow EPS at a ~17% CAGR through F27 vs. the Street's ~13%." Ticker: AMT Year-to-date performance: +6% Predicted upside: +35% Analyst reasoning: "AMT is poised to benefit from increased U.S. carrier activity (AT&T amendments post-Echostar spectrum acquisition; VZ/TMUS densification) and accelerated international growth, driving 6-8% annual AFFO/sh growth from '25-'27E, up from ~1% recently." Ticker: AMZN Year-to-date performance: -0.4% Predicted upside: +23% Analyst reasoning: "Amazon appears most poised for growth due to investments in e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and satellites. As revenue scales, upward revisions to operating profit and FCF could outpace peers. We project operating margins of 11.3% in 2025E, 12.9% in 2026E, and 15.7% in 2027E, with potential upside if incremental revenue generation exceeds current forecasts." Ticker: APP Year-to-date performance: +108% Predicted upside: +13% Analyst reasoning: "Over the next 12-months, we expect APP to execute on a combination of demand and supply expansion initiatives that could improve the efficacy of Axon 2.0 and in-turn deliver estimate and multiple upsides." Ticker: MA Year-to-date performance: +8% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "Within the Payments, Processors, & FinTech sector, Mastercard provides diversified exposure across spend categories and benefits from robust growth in value-added services (~40% of business, high-teens growth). Key strengths include strong profitability (~55-70% EBIT margins, high FCF conversion), competitive moats, scalability, EPS resilience, GAAP-like EPS quality, and expansion into new flows (e.g., Mastercard Move)." Ticker: MRVL Year-to-date performance: -26% Predicted upside: +14% Analyst reasoning: "Marvell is well positioned to grow its Amazon custom ASIC revenue in '26, driven by Tranium2+ exceeding 1MM units next year." Ticker: SNOW Year-to-date performance: +42% Predicted upside: 27% Analyst reasoning: "We're Buy-rated on Snowflake shares, supported by tailwinds such as 1) rising customer focus on data migration and modernization driven by GenAI, 2) resilient AI and data spending amid macro uncertainty, and 3) growth from new products alongside stable core consumption, enabling high-20%/30% growth in FY26/CY25E (vs consensus at 27%)." Ticker: VRNS Year-to-date performance: +28% Predicted upside: +22% Analyst reasoning: "We rate Varonis shares as Buy, driven by 1) rising enterprise focus on data security, supported by AI adoption and dedicated budgets, 2) expected growth beyond conversions post-CY25 via expanded platform features and data store coverage (CY26 revs growth modeled at 21% vs Cons. 18%), and 3) increasing AI deployments enhancing demand for M365 Copilot security through its Microsoft partnership and other AI-driven SKUs." Ticker: BRZE Year-to-date performance: -31% Predicted upside: +43% Analyst reasoning: "We believe BRZE's shares are attractive at 4x CY26 revenue, trading at a discount to SMID apps peers at 11x despite superior growth prospects (20%+ vs. peers in high-teens). Sustained 20%+ revenue growth is supported by customer and partner field checks showing teens-plus spend growth." Jump to

Title: A Northwestern grad shares how she landed job interviews at Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and a tech role at Salesforce

Every time Jacob publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Karishma Mandal wanted to be at the center of the tech world — working in AI at a big-name company in San Francisco. So she moved across the country — and tapped every job search strategy in her toolbox, hoping to land an offer. Mandal's career journey — which would include interviews at Uber, Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce — began when she moved to the US from India in 2021 to pursue a master's in engineering management at Northwestern University. After graduating in January 2023, she began working full-time in March of that year as a product manager at a consulting firm in Chicago — before leaving for a senior product manager role at a healthcare company that November. The position was remote, with team members spread across the country. In her first few months on the job, Mandal said she missed working with people in person — and the time zone differences made it even harder to connect with colleagues. At the same time, she kept hearing about tech meetups and professional events happening regularly in San Francisco — opportunities she said were harder to find in Chicago. There was also the unavoidable buzz around generative AI, the future of which seemed increasingly centered in the Bay Area. San Francisco, she realized, was where she needed to be. So she started planning a move, with the goal of eventually landing an AI-focused role at a large tech company. "I felt like, as a tech person, I had to be in San Francisco," said the 29-year-old. But one big hurdle stood in the way of her plan: the tough tech job market. Mandal is among the many tech professionals who've struggled to find work or to change jobs in recent years. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the start of 2025, global tech companies — including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon — have collectively laid off more than 80,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have coincided with a broader slowdown in white-collar hiring. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are now hiring at nearly the slowest pace since 2014. Still, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Mandal shared how she landed interviews at several tech giants — and ultimately secured a role at Salesforce. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job.

She said she didn't start job hunting right away, in part because the move was overwhelming. There were boxes to unpack, and she didn't have any friends or family in the area. Instead, she focused on settling in and building her social and professional network from scratch. "When I came to San Francisco, I really had no one," she said. When Mandal began her job search in September 2024, she sensed the tech hiring landscape wasn't in her favor. To gain traction, she believed she needed to connect directly with hiring managers and recruiters. Rather than simply applying to job listings, she looked for people who were actively posting about open product manager roles on LinkedIn. One trick she used was searching "product manager + hiring" — a combination that filtered for posts containing both terms. Then she'd apply LinkedIn's "past 24 hours" filter to surface the newest listings. To take things a step further, she'd tweak the URL manually — changing the number of seconds from 86,400 (24 hours) to 3,600 (1 hour) — to see posts from the past hour. Once she found a post of interest, Mandal said she'd message the recruiter or hiring manager — explaining why she was interested in the role and why she thought she'd be a good fit. In addition to filtering LinkedIn posts, Mandal applied the same logic to the platform's job listings tab — using filters to uncover the newest openings. Based on conversations with recruiters and her network, she said she thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role. Many recruiters, she said, are far more likely to closely review the 20th application than the 200th or the 2,000th. Career experts previously told Business Insider that being among the first applicants could give candidates an edge. Mandal was also strategic about how she submitted applications. She said an HR professional at one company told her they prioritized applications submitted directly through their website over those sourced via LinkedIn — even if the candidate was redirected there from a LinkedIn post. Mandal figured following that advice couldn't hurt her chances. To get an extra edge, Mandal said she used the referral platform Refer.me to secure referrals for roles at McKinsey and Best Buy. A free account allows users to send one referral request a week to employees at a wide range of companies. "You have to be early, you have to be through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," Mandal said of her job search strategies. Over time, Mandal's job search strategies began to pay off. She said reaching out to an Amazon recruiter and an Uber hiring manager on LinkedIn — after seeing their posts about open roles — helped her secure interviews at both companies. A separate referral from a Meta employee — sourced outside Refer.me — led to another interview. Business Insider has verified her interview offers by reviewing emails she received from the respective companies. Mandal said her Uber interview included a case study involving AI tools built around user communication data, while Meta's featured questions about measuring the performance of AI features on Instagram. The Amazon interview, she said, focused more on the company's leadership principles. These interviews didn't ultimately lead to offers. But in late 2024, Mandal messaged a Salesforce recruiter on LinkedIn who had posted about an AI-related product manager role — and eventually heard back to schedule an interview. Over the next several weeks, Mandal said she went through a seven-round interview process that included a design exercise where she was asked to create an AI-powered lawn mower; conversations with the engineering, product, and AI teams; and a final interview with a senior leader. "They're not limited to behavioral questions," she said of Salesforce interviews. "Most hiring managers want to see real expertise." Mandal said she received an offer from Salesforce around the end of the year, which included a six-figure salary about 40% higher than what she earned in her previous role. She started full-time in January. While San Francisco's high cost of living has been frustrating at times, she said the career benefits have made relocating from Chicago worthwhile. "If you are trying to make a big career move in tech, I'd recommend living in San Francisco and seeing how you can leverage your network," she said. Jump to

Title: Czech Elections Could Shift Country Away From Pro-European Path, Impacting Support For Ukraine
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/10/mil-251001-rferl01.htm

By Rikard Jozwiak October 01, 2025 When Czech voters head to ballot boxes this weekend, many fear the country may turn away from its pro-European path, taking away one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters as its battle to repel invading Russian forces nears the four-year mark. Most polls indicate that billionaire Andrej Babis and his populist ANO party will win the parliamentary elections on October 3-4 with around 30 percent of the vote. That means Babis would have to form a coalition government with fringe parties, which would bring the country closer to Viktor Orban's Hungary and Robert Fico's Slovakia in terms of its outlook on Ukraine, potentially stopping aid for Kyiv and becoming less enthusiastic about Czech membership in Western institutions. While not in total alignment with Moscow's positions, Prague would become more vocal on the need to immediately stop the war and aim for peace -- most likely on the Kremlin's terms. Expect less harsh rhetoric toward China as well. Polling and political analyst Michael Ashcroft said in an analysis that the Czechs may join "what is from Kyiv's point of view a worrying trend in Central and Eastern Europe, with the existing stance of the Hungarian and Slovakian governments and the new Polish president much less inclined to defend Ukrainian sovereignty." "The consequences could include isolating Ukraine from Western European partners, disrupting military supplies and sowing further division in the alliance," he added. Just as it did in Moldova -- where elections last weekend saw a massive Russian disinformation campaign try and swing voters away from pro-Europe parties -- the Kremlin has been looking to take advantage of the waning support for aid to Ukraine that has helped fuel Babis's rise back to prominence. A Czech research group uncovered nearly 300 anonymous TikTok accounts aimed at amplifying pro-Russian narratives and backing radical parties in the final weeks of the election campaign. The Center For Research Into Online Risks said in a statement on September 28 that Czech TikTok accounts with millions of followers "are systematically spreading pro-Russian propaganda and support for anti-system parties through manipulated engagement." The center added that the accounts are not tied to a single political entity, instead "combining support for multiple anti-system parties simultaneously." "The cumulative reach of these accounts is 5 to 9 million views per week, more than the combined official accounts of the leaders of the largest Czech political parties on TikTok," it said. Analysts say the key thing to look out for now is which parties gain enough votes to enter parliament as Babis will likely need a coalition to govern. Spolu (Together), an alliance of center-right parties that includes the incumbent Prime Minister Petr Fiala's Civic Democrats is polling at around 20 percent, whereas the other parties of the current pro-Western coalition government Stan (Mayors and Independents) and the Pirates are predicted to end up with 10-12 percent each. All of these parties have said that they aren't interested in entering a coalition with ANO or even backing it with votes to pass legislation as a single-party minority government. But this is preelection talk and the tune could very well change after the vote, especially amid growing fears that more radical coalition alternatives could derail the Czech Republic's pro-Western course. As junior coalition partners, they could demand key posts in the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. Secondly, there are factions in the current government, notably in the Civic Democrats, that share ANO's political positions -- committed to NATO but weaker on EU membership and opposed to euro adoption and Brussels policies such as mandatory refugee quotas and the green deal. But the Central European country could also change radically if Babis teams up with any of the current opposition parties that are even more radical than the ANO. These include the far-right SPD, polling above 10 percent, as well as a smaller far-right outfit AUTO (Motorists for themselves) and the far-left Stacilo (Enough), both of which are expected to clear the 5 percent threshold needed to gain seats in parliament. Governing with any of them would likely lead to a real rapprochement with Orban and Fico, both of whom have been critical of aid to Ukraine and are also in the vanguard of countries in Europe that continue to purchase Russian oil and natural gas despite Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A key figure in whatever comes after the election is pro-Western President Petr Pavel, who plays a role in government formation as well as foreign policy in general. Pavel, a former senior NATO general, has made it clear that he won't allow a government that strays too far from the Western course. Babis has been a constant fixture of Czech politics for the last 15 years, first serving as finance minister and deputy prime minister before leading the country from 2017 to 2021, as well as attempting to become president only to be trounced by Pavel in the 2023 election. One of the country's richest people, with considerable stakes in agribusiness and media, his time in the public spotlight has been dogged by legal disputes and accusations of conflicts of interest and EU subsidy fraud. Yet, it's also his business interests that many believe could keep him, and by extension the Czech Republic, anchored in the West as good relations between the Czech Republic and France, Germany, and Austria as well as the continued flow of EU agriculture and cohesion funds are more important than anything Beijing and Moscow can offer. Babis has chartered a more populist course in recent years and was one of the creators of the biggest populist forces on the continent, Patriots for Europe, a political family also consisting of Orban's Fidesz, Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, Spain's Vox, and Austria's Freedom party. He has also voiced support for Fico's Smer party even though they are not formally part of the Patriots for Europe alliance. Rallying against all things Brussels, environmentalism, and immigration, they would also find sympathetic ears beyond Central Europe with right-wing populists of various hues on the rise or in power in many other Western capitals as well.

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi

After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: Walmart CEO expects AI will 'change literally every job' - not just engineering

Time Published: 2025-09-30T20:01:00Z
Full Content:
Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has good news and bad news for the more than two million global workers employed by his company. The bad news is that AI is rapidly going to transform all of those employees' roles, and soon. The good news is that, in his view, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be out of a job. Also: Nearly everything you've heard about AI and job cuts is wrong - here's why Speaking at a conference in Bentonville, Arkansas, home of Walmart's headquarters, last week, McMillon told the audience that it's by now "very clear that AI is going to change literally every job," according to a Friday report from The Wall Street Journal. Walmart is the largest employer in the world, so when McMillon unequivocally declares his conviction that AI is going to reshape his company from the ground up, that's a vision for the future with ramifications that will be felt by millions of workers globally, at every rung of the socioeconomic ladder. Thus far, many predictions about the potential for AI to transform the job market have focused on white-collar jobs, especially software engineering. Also: Will AI replace software engineers? It depends on who you ask It's true that the growing availability and sophistication of AI coding tools does seem to be one of the factors that's been making it more difficult for young computer science grads to find work in the tech industry. At the same time, however, the race among tech companies to build ever-more powerful AI models has also sparked a talent war that has hugely inflated the salaries of some of the industry's more established engineers. Some new AI tools, especially those that are designed to generate video, could also replace many creative roles in industries like filmmaking and advertising. Also: OpenAI tested GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini on real-world tasks - the results were surprising McMillon's prediction, however, paints a much more unilateral and democratic picture of the future of AI-powered automation: it isn't just salaried office workers who will feel the effects of AI, but also warehouse workers, checkout cashiers, and millions of others, many of whom are already working paycheck-to-paycheck. That said, his vision for the future is more about transformation than replacement. In his view, as business leaders rush to onboard new AI tools, they also have a responsibility to provide the requisite upskilling to workers. "We've got to create the opportunity for everybody to make it to the other side," he said at the Bentonville conference. Also: Got AI skills? You can earn 43% more in your next job - and not just for tech work This language portrays AI not as a giant ax that will cleave many workers from their livelihoods, but as a moment of societal change -- a chasm which executives should help their employees cross safely. In the absence of robust federal oversight of AI, the onus of responsibility for managing the technology's impacts upon the labor market will likely fall disproportionately on employers' shoulders. The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, a set of policies released earlier this summer, emphasized AI upskilling without outlining any protections for workers displaced by the technology. McMillon's stance is supported by recent data from Indeed, which indicates that AI is transforming specific job requirements more than it's replacing jobs themselves. Similarly, a recent report shared exclusively with ZDNET found that only 11% of executives surveyed believe that AI will significantly reduce their workforce, while 84% said they expect the technology to alter the nature of existing roles within their companies. Elsewhere, recent research from OpenAI found several frontier models performed competitively with human experts on economically viable work tasks that contribute to US GDP. Also: The best free AI courses and certificates in 2025 - and I've tried many In that same vein, Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon (the second-biggest employer in the world) recently told CNBC that AI will lead to "fewer people doing some of the jobs," while also creating new ones.

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions. On top of that, tight expense control and smarter use of capital drove higher returns and profitability. Its growing consumer and private-wealth businesses added another layer of stability, helping smooth out earnings in what’s often a cyclical industry. 10. Philip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris International, best known for its iconic cigarette brands, has been reshaping itself into a broader smoke-free and nicotine-focused company. That transition gained real traction in 2025. The company’s heated tobacco and vaping products continued to win over consumers, driving growth even as traditional cigarette volumes declined. Strong demand for its IQOS platform and other reduced-risk products helped boost both revenue and margins. At the same time, Philip Morris managed costs tightly and generated solid cash flow, which supported dividends and buybacks—key priorities for investors. The result was a more balanced, forward-looking business model that’s less dependent on traditional tobacco sales. Key themes tying these names together Risks and watch points ConclusionThese are the 10 strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. For the most part, these companies are able to grow their earnings, revenue, and have predictable cash flow. While each stock carries company-specific risks, the ten strongest stocks in 2025 reflect the strongest mega cap stocks in 2025. Barring some unforeseen sell off, these stocks can continue to lead as we head into Q4 and beyond. Disclaimer: These are not buy ideas & no investment advice is being given.

Title: A quarter of bosses admit their return-to-office mandates were meant to make staff quit

Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs. Bosses have spent the better part of two years summoning their employees back to the office, making remote-loving workers “quiet quit” in protest, while others have threatened to quit for real. But that’s secretly what a significant chunk of CEOs were hoping for. According to research from BambooHR, a survey of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found a quarter of C-suite executives hoped for some voluntary turnover among workers after implementing a return-to-office (RTO) policy. Meanwhile, one in five HR professionals admitted their in-office policy was meant to make staff quit. It’s why the report concludes what many workers have long suspected: that “RTO mandates are layoffs in disguise.” It’s no secret that rigid in-office policies haven’t landed well with workers. Amazon is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get. Around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand. When the tech giant eventually demanded workers show face in the office five days a week, numerous staffers told Fortune they were immediately updating their LinkedIn profiles and “rage applying” for new jobs. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” one person said. Research has shown 99% of companies with RTO mandates have seen a drop in engagement. Meanwhile, separate data shows that nearly half of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated, and 29% of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment. BambooHR’s research has further highlighted that nearly a third of workers would consider leaving their positions if forced to return to their company’s towers. But in reality, many workers aren’t following through with such threats—and fewer are quitting than bosses had hoped. Nearly 40% of all managers in the survey said they believe their organization did layoffs because not enough workers quit in response to their company’s RTO mandate.

Title: Dynamic Discounting: How to Do Dynamic Pricing Right

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Dynamic pricing doesn’t have to turn off customers. Wharton’s John Zhang says companies can correct perceptions of unfairness by clearly communicating the value. Z. John Zhang Z. John Zhang The following article was written by Wharton marketing professor Z. John Zhang. Dynamic pricing isn’t new. Airlines, hotels, and ride-hailing companies have long relied on it to balance demand and supply, maximize profitability, and serve different types of customers. But in 2025, dynamic pricing is spreading rapidly across industries — from grocery retail to fast food to fashion e-commerce to tickets for the upcoming FIFA World Cup — powered by artificial intelligence, digital price tags, and real-time demand data. The current tariff uncertainties and inflation concerns are further impetus for firms to flirt with, and even embrace, dynamic pricing. Done right, dynamic pricing can benefit both firms and consumers. Done poorly, it can trigger backlash and erode trust. The economic logic is straightforward: Customer willingness to pay varies. It varies across customers, and for the same customer, across occasions and over time. A family booking a vacation months in advance has a very different willingness to pay than an executive booking a same-day flight, and almost everyone is willing to pay more for roses on Valentine’s Day than on any other day. Dynamic pricing helps companies capitalize on this variation, charging a high-willingness-to-pay customer a high price and a low-willingness-to-pay customer a low price at the right time. In the airline industry, leisure travelers secure affordable tickets by booking early, while business travelers can still find seats at the last minute, albeit at a higher price. Uber’s surge pricing — which is a specific type of dynamic pricing — not only helps match riders to drivers but also attracts more drivers into busy zones, increasing supply when it’s most needed. The principle holds across industries. When prices reflect demand and capacity in real time, resources are allocated more efficiently, and customers often have more choice. Firms, of course, stand to reap more short-term profits by charging more to those who are willing to pay more, while accommodating those who can afford to pay only a low price, thus getting both high margins and high volumes for their products or services. Although consumers often conflate them, dynamic pricing and surge pricing are not the same. Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the price of a good or service up or down over time, with some business objectives in mind. Surge pricing is a specific type of dynamic pricing in which a company raises the price of a product or service, unexpectedly for consumers, when demand exceeds supply. It is not surprising to see that several industries are experimenting with new forms of dynamic pricing: History offers cautionary tales. Coca-Cola’s 1999 experiment with vending machines that raised prices in hot weather drew swift backlash, with critics calling it exploitative. The company shelved the idea in the U.S. Wendy’s recent surge pricing announcement triggered a similar outcry and provided a good lesson on what can go wrong with introducing dynamic pricing. Even FIFA’s announcement about future dynamic pricing did not go unnoticed, drawing a New Yok Post headline, “World Cup’s dynamic-priced tickets will cost an arm and a leg — and ruin the global game.” Wendy’s case is worthy of some special attention. In early 2024, Wendy’s CEO Kirk Tanner announced the company’s intention to invest $20 million on high-tech menu boards that can change prices in real time. This means that a Dave’s burger can cost more during busy times like lunch and dinner. The intention here is not a bad one. By charging higher prices at busy times, Wendy’s can shift some of the demand to less busy times, reducing the peak-load staffing as well as some stress for its workers. In addition, with a smaller lunch or dinner crowd, customers would spend less time waiting for their orders at peak times. However, the prospect of dynamic pricing was immediately interpreted by the media and the public as an Uber type of surge pricing for burgers, and it was taken as another example of a greedy corporation trying to exploit customers. Critics noted that unlike Uber, higher prices don’t magically create more burgers at lunchtime and hungry customers get the short end of the stick. Not surprisingly, significant negative public reaction ensued, with “#BoycottWendys” trending on social media. The lesson: Consumers instinctively do not like dynamic pricing or understand it. They resist when it feels like opportunism and when it is not clear what is in it for them. Even in the airline industry, where customers are long used to price variations, dynamic pricing has fueled perceptions of unfairness, making airlines a perennial symbol of consumer frustration. The fact of the matter is that customers have nothing to fear about dynamic pricing. Basic economics dictates that when all following three conditions are present, it is a non-brainer for a firm in any industry to embrace dynamic pricing. First, customer willingness to pay for your firm’s product or services varies over time. Second, your firm has the capability to identify when a customer is willing to pay a high or low price. Third, your firm finds a good way to communicate and implement dynamic pricing without alienating customers. Your firm can avoid alienating customers if dynamic pricing improves access, availability, or fairness for them. The first condition is generally satisfied when: The second condition is always achievable if a firm is willing to make sufficient investments in information gathering, processing, and displaying technologies. Big data and AI capabilities have certainly motivated many firms to look in the direction of dynamic pricing today. But capability alone isn’t enough. Firms must anticipate customer reaction, communicate transparently, and frame price changes around value creation rather than profit extraction. For this reason, the third condition is critical to the success or failure in implementing dynamic pricing. Coming back to Wendy’s PR disaster, the company clarified later that they had “no plans” to raise prices when demand is high. It wants to use its digital menu boards to offer discounts and other value offers during slower periods, not to charge more during peak times. In other words, Wendy’s never wanted to embrace surge pricing, and it intended to offer what I called “dynamic discounting.” Unfortunately, that intention was lost in communication, partially due to the fact that Wendy’s was not clear about it. With dynamic discounting, a firm starts with a fixed regular price and offers variable discounts. Such a mechanism can generate any price point that dynamic pricing can. For instance, Wendy’s can charge its price for Dave’s burgers dynamically, $6 at 11 a.m. to noon, $8 at noon to 1 p.m., and $7 at 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. However, when framed as dynamic discounting, the regular price for the burger becomes $8, and Wendy’s can offer $2 off at 11 a.m. to noon, and $1 off from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Dynamic discounting is then much more palatable to customers because nearly everyone gets a trophy. “Everyone gets a trophy” may not be the smartest idea in competitive sports, but it can help to endear customers to dynamic pricing. Similarly, with dynamic discounting, Coca-Cola could have easily set its regular prices based on hot weather and offered colder weather discounts to avoid consumer backlash. FIFA can use it to shift media and customer focus away from speculating on outlandish prices “for a top-tier seat for the July 19 final at East Rutherford, New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium.” Dynamic pricing is becoming a competitive necessity. The fact of the matter is that customers have nothing to fear about dynamic pricing. If anything, dynamic pricing shifts power to savvy consumers. Those who monitor fluctuations, book at the right time, or shop across platforms can consistently secure lower prices. In a dynamic pricing world, knowledge is power. Stock prices are dynamic. Because of it, savvy investors can buy low and sell high. For goods and services without such cycles, consumers still benefit from dynamic pricing in many ways. For instance, Amtrak tickets between Philadelphia and New York can vary from $10 to $200, and informed buyers can exploit the swings by being vigilant and diligent. Without dynamic pricing, Amtrak would have to charge a much higher everyday price to everyone, its train service would become much less accessible, and trains would run with many more empty seats. Yes, under dynamic pricing, some consumers will inevitably pay higher prices. However, when done right, the consumers who face higher prices will also be the ones who could afford to pay more and get more in return. For instance, business travelers can pay more and will pay more under dynamic pricing. In return for the higher prices, they can get a last-minute ticket or a ticket on a convenient schedule any time business calls for a trip. If you are still not convinced that you will benefit from dynamic pricing as a consumer, you may feel much better hearing that the cumulative profits for the airlines industry since the deregulation in 1978 are zero or slightly negative. This is the industry that pioneered dynamic pricing in modern times and that always stays on the cutting edge of the craft. With all the pricing sophistication the industry can muster, it fails to reap more profits because dynamic pricing has fundamentally changed the game for the industry to the benefits of all consumers. The best analogy I can use to explain the situation is American boxing. The basic rules for American boxing are that you can use only two fists and punch opponents only above the waist. However, in Thai boxing, you are allowed to use your two fists as well as two feet and punch and kick the opponent anywhere. It’s definitely a more competitive and bloodier game, as the opponents have more flexibility and more weapons to hurt each other. Ironically, while dynamic pricing gives an adopting airline the advantage of using more price points (equivalently both fists and two feet) to compete against the opponent staying with conventional pricing (two fists), the advantage disappears when the opponent also adopts dynamic pricing. When all airlines use dynamic pricing, they are playing Thai boxing instead of American boxing — each opponent has more pricing points and flexibility to steal rivals’ customers. Not surprisingly, more sophisticated dynamic pricing may offer an adopting firm some fleeting unilateral advantages, but its collective use will benefit consumers and society at large. Dynamic pricing is becoming a competitive necessity. But the winners won’t just be those with the most sophisticated algorithms. The true winners will be the companies that deploy it responsibly: balancing profitability with fairness with customers in mind, designing transparent systems, and ensuring customers feel served rather than squeezed. Customers will accept volatility if dynamic pricing is rooted in supply-and-demand logic, not in opportunism, and if customers feel they also get more from it. Customers will feel they’re getting more if you frame dynamic pricing as dynamic discounting. Sign up to stay informed about our latest article releases.

Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. Will eliminate around 450 jobs as part of a cost and operations review, according to Reuters. The layoffs will span multiple functions and countries, including customer service and sales. Europe’s largest food delivery company said it is increasingly using automation and AI, shifting many manual service tasks to automated systems. Plans to cut around 250 jobs, approximately 30% of its workforce, as part of a push to become a leaner, faster, and AI-focused company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Tel Aviv-headquartered freelance services marketplace said the restructuring will reduce management layers and position it to pursue growth with an AI-native approach. Is closing its Tel Aviv development center, cutting about 80 jobs. Led by Yosi Taguri, the office specialized in software, data, and AI research, including algorithm development. The California-based recruitment firm, founded in 2010, is trimming costs amid a challenging labor market. Has laid off at least 100 employees, including junior developers, just months after cutting nearly 200 jobs. The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, raised $60 million in equity and debt in July. Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs, according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected. Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. Is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings. Is laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system. Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200. The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in.

Title: Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs

The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Vanguard Rivals Finally Get Hands On Its Tax-Busting Fund Design But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

Meanwhile, the White House, under President Donald Trump, has orchestrated a crypto push and hedge funds, pensions and banks have lavished capital into these and similar types of products. BlackRock’s Ether fund, ETHA, sports $15 billion in assets.

Last year, Bloomberg Intelligence forecast that Vanguard may reverse its Bitcoin ban. “The astounding success of the ETFs added a lot to the pressure,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas, author of The Bogle Effect and a BI senior ETF analyst. “Had Bitcoin ETFs been a flop, I don’t think they would consider lifting the ban.” Isabelle Lee You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 3, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

U.S. stocks fell slightly today as worries over a possible government shutdown grew. Investors are concerned that the shutdown could delay important economic data, including jobs and inflation reports. These reports are crucial for the Federal Reserve to decide on interest rate changes. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all showed minor losses. Traders adopted a cautious “wait-and-see” approach, uncertain about how long a shutdown could last and its impact on the economy.

Title: The Future of Labor in Retail | Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino
URL: http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/ripple-effect/the-future-of-labor-in-retail-marshall-fisher-and-santiago-gallino/
Time Published: 2025-09-30T14:00:32Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Professors Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino look at how labor affects the grocery industry. Marshall Fisher Santiago Gallino Dan Loney Listen to the podcast. Grocery is one of the toughest segments of retail to turn a profit. Wharton’s Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino talk about the headwinds faced by both small and large grocers. This episode is part of the “Future of Retail” series. Dan Loney: We are at an interesting time in the labor markets. The economy is pretty strong, but technology is playing a larger role in the day-to-day operations. How to manage a staff plays a big part in the success of the firm. A recent report by two Wharton professors looks at the state of retail labor using the grocery industry as the main example. Pleasure to be joined by Marshall Fisher, who’s a professor of operations, information and decisions here at the Wharton School, and also Santiago Gallino, who’s an associate professor of operations, information and decisions as well as an associate professor of marketing here. Gentlemen, why the focus in terms of understanding more about the labor market with the grocery area specifically? Santiago Gallino: I think the interest came because labor — in retail in general, and grocery is no exception — is one of the main expenses that retailers have, together with inventory. I think that over the years, there has been a lot of effort in optimizing inventory and thinking about that. But relative to inventory effort, staffing has been understudied. And that’s where we thought it was an opportunity to help retailers. Marshall Fisher: The other interesting thing that was happening is growth in dot-com. Grocery had been sort of a laggard. Right? Grocery was a bit slow, until along came this thing called COVID in 2020. Nobody wanted to go into a store anymore, so online surged. Grocery had to get better at that. We wanted to look at how well they were doing. What grade would you give them, Santiago? About a D? They had this wonderful, innovative model, where you place your order online and at no charge to the customer someone goes into the store and picks it for you, which roughly doubled the labor cost and and eliminated all profit they were earning. Loney: It is interesting when you think about grocery and how technology has changed a lot of the dynamics not only in the checkout area, but also in placing the order. Is the expectation that technology will continue to evolve retail labor in grocery as we move forward, just like we’re expecting more and more technology to come into our lives? Gallino: Yes, I agree with that. I think what we are going to see as we move forward is many of the technologies that are already available will become good investments. I think that is a driver of what retailers are incorporating over time. Many of the things that are new today here in the U.S. have been in place in Europe, in certain countries, for many years. This is mainly because the ROI of those technology investments have been justified several years ago in countries like Norway or Sweden and now, because of the pressure, are reasonable investments here in the U.S. I think that that has been a driver of incorporating technology on the operational side. Many of the technology we see is new, but others have been around for a while. It’s just waiting to be a good investment to be acquired by the retailers. Loney: Marshall, if the numbers and the information you’re seeing in the grocery segment with how they’re handling their labor — should we expect it to be the same across all kinds of retail businesses? Fisher: Yeah, absolutely. As I mentioned before, some segments of retail are ahead in moving to e-commerce. Apparel would be somewhere in the middle. Obviously, books, video, and consumer electronics are ahead of the game in terms of moving online. Grocery’s the laggard. So I think grocery’s learning from other segments, rather than the other way around. Santiago mentioned technology. It’s worth a minute or two to talk about, what’s the technology? The part that’s easy is having the customer place an order online. What’s hard then, is fulfilling that order. As we mentioned, the thing that was easy for grocery retailers to ramp up when COVID hit was just pick from the store. There’s been an emergence of automating the picking process. Walmart has done a pretty good job. What they put in place are mega warehouses. Sometimes it’s an enlarged back room of the store, so they can have the same inventory for filling an online order as servicing the store. They’ve automated the picking from the warehouse of a subset of the items, and then whatever doesn’t lend itself to automation, like fresh product, they’ll pick from the store, put that together and ship it out to the customer. That’s sort of the frontier of online grocery, is getting better and better at the picking and fulfillment process. Loney: Is the expectation that the online part of the grocery will continue to grow? I say that because grocery is one of those unique things for some of us— and I am like this— I still like to go into the grocery store and see my products and pick them myself. There are those people, though, that are already at the point where they feel comfortable just ordering online. Fisher: And they’re called young people. Loney: Yes, that’s right. Fisher: Will it grow? Sure, as a greater and greater percentage of the population grew up with the internet, they feel comfortable doing that. Gallino: Another challenge it is that when there is a stock out in the order, in other categories, this is less critical than in grocery. Because if you are trying to fill up your basket and milk is missing, you will need to go to the store anyways. If you are buying apparel or some thing, you can wait. That’s not a big deal. You can still do 100% of the transaction online. And I think that that puts, I will argue, an extra pressure for grocery retailers to fully convert customers to the online experience. Loney: Is e-commerce delivering the ROI that the owners of these grocery chains expect, Santiago? Gallino: I don’t think so. That is a great question. And every time I try to get an answer from grocery retailers, the answer is very elusive in bringing the idea of long-term profitability, long-term strategic approach. It’s telling me that in the short run, this is a painful process. Some of them are not losing money anymore with the online grocery channel. But it’s clearly, in my opinion, the less attractive channel for them to fulfill an order. I will say that if a grocery retailer can choose, they would much rather like you to go to the store, because that’s a more profitable transaction for them. Loney: Marshall, with the addition of all of these components of technology, how does that change how the grocery, as a company, thinks about their employees? Fisher: I’ll answer your question with a comparison of two retailers and two executives at those retailers that have a connection to Wharton. So Costco, Richard Galanti, who retired this year, was CFO. Wharton undergrad. Spent 30 or 40 years in that job of CFO. Described his job as doing whatever the CEO didn’t want to do, including the earnings calls. Marc Lore was in the MBA program. Did the first year, and then somehow found starting companies was where his heart was, and created Jet. Left, sold that to Walmart, headed to Walmart.com. Two different approaches. Walmart, under Marc — and this gets to your profitability question. When he took over, they were losing about a $1 billion a year in dot-com. One of the things he was most proud of is that loss steadily declined until now they break even or maybe earn a small profit on dot-com. But he was once interviewed with the head of Walmart stores. And they asked him, “How do you two guys relate and get along?” And Marc said, “Oh, it’s very simple. He makes the money and I spend it.” But he is proud, through innovations he put in place, that that loss has come down to break even or small profit. And Walmart’s stock price earnings ratio tripled as they moved to dot-com. Dot-com retailers trade at higher multiple, right? And was it profitable for them? Yeah. You’d have to say so. Now, Costco trades at 55 times earnings, and they’re the opposite model. Their dot.com penetration rate is minuscule, about 5%. And you think about, why is that? They have not run out of room for growth with the traditional store model. They realized that they have to improve their dot-com game because people want to buy online. And they’re doing that. But up till now, they’ve said, “Thanks very much. We don’t need dot-com.” Loney: Santiago, what do you expect these changes are going to do to grocery as we move forward? Gallino: I think that we are going to see a revival of the physical store in grocery. I think that some of the players, as Marshall was explaining, are able to leverage the scale and play a game that incorporates not just the fulfillment of the order but some kind of advertisement revenue that comes from their online efforts. But others, the smaller players, will lean on the physical store and experience. I will argue that old customers and young customers always appreciate a good in store experience. And I think that there are good examples in grocery where the number of stores is growing. Aldi, with a completely new format in the U.S., is growing very, very rapidly. You can call it traditional, boring stores. But when they’re not boring to customers that are willing to make the trip and go to the physical store. So, I will anticipate in the coming years a revival of the physical store. Fisher: And Trader Joe’s might be an example. They don’t dot-com. If you want to buy from Trader Joe’s, you go to the store. And they seem to work pretty hard at not making it boring. Loney: Santiago, you mentioned a little bit ago about the difference between stores here in the U.S. and other countries. Part of this research was looking at what grocery is like in other countries. Tell us about that side of the story. Gallino: Yes, I think it’s interesting to compare that and look outside. The main driver of the experience in different countries, I will argue, is the hourly rate that employees get in the stores. If you go to places like Latin America, the employees in the store are very abundant. Why? Well, because labor is relatively cheap. Customers like to see employees, and the retailer can afford that. So, there is a lot of that kind of first-hand experience interaction with employees in the store. Europe, on the other end of the spectrum, like I was mentioning before, has incorporated a lot of technology and has pushed the efficiency of the store in terms of labor to an extreme. That drives the experience of the customer, too, in this format. Size, the frequency of the visit. In Europe, most customers will walk to the store to buy. They buy small baskets, and that drives the format of the store. I think that sometimes we need to remember that the driver of the format is a combination of the customer expectation and the labor market conditions. Fisher: I just want to mention one thing and follow up to what Santiago was talking about. Costco, in some ways, in their labor practice, looks more like a European retailer. They pay their people well. Really well. You go into a Costco store and you’ll see someone who’s been there for 20 years. I think their turnover is like 6% a year. Other grocery formats in the U.S., the turnover is about 60% a year. So we’re talking about store labor. The Costco model is really impressive in all kinds of ways.

Title: These Small, Unloved Companies Are The Next Big Dividend Plays

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Small caps are (finally!) back, but most people are in the dark about how to tap them for serious dividends. But there is a proven way to do that—one that puts a rich 7.1% payout squarely on the table for us. Everyone has missed this one. We’re going to dive into it today. The main reason I hate to see people ignore small caps—especially now—is that, well, their time has come. As you can see, It’s been a solid decade of small-caps delivering, well, small profits to investors. But it’s time for the script to flip. In fact, it’s already happening: After years of being dusted by big caps, small caps are matching them point for point this year—even pulling ahead, going by the performance of the benchmark iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) in orange above, over the last three months. I see that continuing. For one, small firms tend to have close, personal relationships with clients, keeping their loyalty—and small firms’ sales along with it—strong. Moreover, they tend to be domestic, so they directly profit from the US economy’s strength (which we discussed in last Thursday’s article) and get a hedge from global headaches (including on trade), too. Of course, there are drawbacks to buying these “small fry”: For one, unless the company is near where you live, say, or factors into your work life, you probably don’t know much about it. That’s unlike, say, big caps like Microsoft (MSFT), which get loads of analyst and media coverage. Another, of course, is the dividends. Many small caps are earlier in their growth process—and if they’re lucky, on their way to becoming tomorrow’s large caps. Unfortunately, this means many can’t afford to both fund that growth and pay dividends. This is why, for the most part at my CEF Insider service, we’ve focused on closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold large caps and high-yield bonds. Not only have they delivered bigger gains than small caps, but they’ve been handing us high, steady dividends, too. You get a sense of that when you compare the average CEF yield—8.3%—with the payout on the small-cap benchmark iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM): a mere 1%. Still, every rule has its exception. When it comes to small caps, that exception is a CEF called the Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). This fund (in orange below) has closely tracked small caps, but with a twist: It “translates” small cap gains into dividends—7.1% payouts, to be exact. The power of a fund like RVT is in its structure: the managers at Royce Investment Partners invest in many different small caps—488, to be exact. Its three top holdings are IES Holdings (IESC), Assured Guaranty (AGO) and SEI Investments (SEIC). Note this chart: IESC (in blue above) installs electrical and technology systems for businesses and had $2.9 billion of sales in its latest fiscal year. Revenue soared 16% in the latest quarter on strong data-center growth (no surprise there). Meantime over at financial firm SEIC (in orange), EPS jumped 70% and revenue jumped 8% in the latest quarter, driven in part by higher interest in alternative investments. As for financial-insurer AGO (in purple), the firm saw net income rise 32% in the last quarter as municipalities continued rolling out bonds at a record pace. All of these stocks’ gains are pushing up RVT’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), putting a lift under its share price. Royce’s job is to take profits on its winners and use its gains to buy up-and-comers and maintain its 7.1% dividend. Now, to be sure, RVT’s dividend does float a little. That’s because it has a mandate to pay dividends at a yearly rate of 7% of the average of the last four quarters of NAV (calculated at quarter-end). So if NAV rises, payouts do, too. I like this payout strategy because it means the fund is not bound to a fixed payout and has flexibility to reinvest gains in other opportunities where it sees them. And even with that flexibility, RVT’s dividend has been remarkably consistent (and even up modestly) over the last five years: Moreover, RVT is still available at a 9.2% discount to NAV. That markdown has momentum, too, up from double digits in late August. Given that RVT’s discount shrunk below 6% in January, before tariff fears sent it plunging in the spring, we still have potential for upside on a closing discount here. The bottom line is that RVT has been doing a good job of “translating” small cap gains into 7% dividends for a long time. That’s why, as small cap momentum ramps up, we see the fund as a good one in which to slowly build a position. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: End Of Quarter Review & What’s Next For Stocks?

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. At the end of every month, quarter, and year I like to step back and review what actually happened in the market. That helps me remain objective, review my work, look for areas where I can improve, remove my cognitive (a.k.a. emotional) biases, and helps me set the stage for what may happen next. That said, here are a few points that jumped out at me as we wrap up Q3 2025. Bulls Are In Control The big headline for me is that the bulls are in control. The stock market is trading at/near record highs and has overcome literally ever negative headline that came out this year. Big picture, that tells me the bulls are in control and, barring some unforeseen event, we are likely headed much higher. 2025 Year In Review2025 began with President Donald Trump returning to the White House for his second term. In January, few could have predicted the dramatic economic journey that would unfold over the next few months. The early days of 2025 were characterized by a palpable sense of anticipation, excitement, and a little confusion about how tariffs would impact both Main Street and Wall Street. Trump’s inaugural address signaled a return to economic nationalism, promising to redefine America’s global economic position. Investors and economists watched closely as the administration began implementing a series of bold economic policies that would send ripples through global markets. Stocks fell hard in February and March as confusion reigned supreme. President Trump unveiled the most comprehensive tariff package in modern American history. The sweeping economic measures targeted multiple global economic powers, with actions against many of our major trading partners. The tariffs were unprecedented in their scope and intensity, covering everything from technology and manufacturing to agricultural products. Stocks Fell In Q1 The immediate market reaction in February and March was pretty severe. The S&P 500 fell 20% within a few weeks, with global markets experiencing similar dramatic declines. Economists warned of a potential recession, and investors braced themselves for what seemed like an impending economic warfare. The financial world held its collective breath, wondering if this would be the moment that would unravel the global economic order. Stocks Rallied In Q2 & Q3 But the market had other plans. In a remarkable display of resilience, the stock market bottomed in April 2025 after Trump lowered and extended global tariffs. The administration dubbed it "Liberation Day." Remember, the market is a forward looking mechanism and knew that the economy was strong and we would recover. Many areas of the market and leading stocks soared over the next few months. The S&P 500 vaulted 38% from April’s low to September’s record high. Tech and AI stocks led the charge higher with investors pumping trillions of dollars into the market. Tech stocks became a primary driver of economic innovation. Breakthrough developments in AI, quantum computing, and renewable energy technologies created new economic opportunities. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing saw massive investments, signaling a strategic shift towards technological self-sufficiency which is important for President Trump. It was also very impressive to see the market race higher even after many of Trump’s tariffs went into effect in the summer. That illustrates how strong the market is right now. Fed Cuts Rates In other, but also important news, The Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in years, even as the stock market hit fresh record highs. Inflation came down a bit and the jobs report got weaker in Q3. The fact that the Fed is cutting rates is bullish for both Main Street and Wall Street. Looking forward, the Fed said it will cut rates a few more times and, as always, it remains data dependent. Geopolitical Tensions Geopolitical tensions continued to play a significant role throughout the year. Ongoing negotiations with China, challenges in European markets, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East didn’t stop the bulls from buying stocks. Once again, the American market demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and innovate in the face of these challenges. IPO Environment Is Improving A few years ago, the IPO market contracted and dried up. That changed in 2025, so far the IPO and startup landscape has improved and looks promising. Despite initial market turbulence, venture capital continued to flow, and more stocks IPO’d this year. Small & Mid Cap Stocks Woke Up It was also encouraging to see the rally broaden out as small and mid cap stocks began to rally in Q3, after being dormant for most of 2025. While large-cap technology stocks dominated the headlines, the small and mid-cap stocks began to wake up in Q3. They were dormant for Q1 and Q2 but they came to life in Q3 after the Fed opened the door to cut rates. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was negative and unchanged for most of the year on a year-to-date percent change basis, but it is now up 9% in 2025. Most of those gains came in Q3. The same is true for mid cap stocks. They were negative to flat for most of the year and then they came to life and rallied in Q3 2025. Looking Ahead The stock market is trading near record highs as we wrap up Q3. That is very encouraging and tells me we can easily continue to race higher. Of course, anything is possible and we can always pullback. Looking forward, we will likely have another correction at some point but as long as we remain above the 50 day moving average, the bulls remain in clear control. We are in a bull market and in bull markets surprises usually happen to the upside, not the downside.

Title: US senators target H-1B, L-1 visa loopholes in new bipartisan reform bill

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/30/2025 5:13:28 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Two of the US Senate’s most senior lawmakers are once again teaming up to overhaul America’s high-skilled H-1B and L-1 visa systems, saying companies have turned what was meant to be a tool for innovation into a loophole for outsourcing. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dick Durbin reintroduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act. This latest push comes just weeks after US President Donald Trump signed a sweeping presidential proclamation on H-1B visa applications. Under the new order, companies are now required to pay a one-time fee of $100,000 (around Rs 88 lakh) on every new H-1B visa application. Earlier, the senators sent letters to 10 major employers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, questioning why they were filing thousands of visa petitions even as they laid off American employees. "Congress created the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes as limited pathways for businesses to acquire top talent when it can’t be found at home," Grassley said in a statement. "But over the years, many employers have used them to cut out American workers in favour of cheap foreign labour. Congress must step in again to bring integrity back to these programmes and restore dignity for American and foreign workers," he added. Durbin repeated the concern, pointing to mass layoffs in tech. "Major companies are laying off thousands of American workers while filing thousands of visa petitions for foreign workers at depressed wages and poor working conditions," he said. "Congress must step in to protect American workers and fix our broken immigration system." (Excerpt) Read more at indiatoday.in ...

I get what you’re saying... but Durbin also said he wanted to ‘fix our broken immigration system.” Amnesty anyone? “ Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dick Durbin reintroduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act.” *********************************************** I’m not sure I’d willingly eat a meal prepared jointly by these two “cooks”. “ Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dick Durbin reintroduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act.” *********************************************** I’m not sure I’d willingly eat a meal prepared jointly by these two “cooks”. “ Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dick Durbin reintroduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act.” *********************************************** I’m not sure I’d willingly eat a meal prepared jointly by these two “cooks”. Yeah, this is BS. Durbin and Grassley are not here for us. They are here for them. Both swamp creatures. Yep. Bipartisan = not good enough. H1B Indians wrote the 737 MAX software. Not surprised. So this is their “best and brightest”. Give the best & brightest (Indians) credit: They’ll have workarounds for whatever legislation these bozos craft before the ink is dry on their “reform.” There’s no need for reform. Shut it down & send them home. Not the MCAS which caused the crashes. Boeing utilized contractors (including temporary workers and low-paid professionals from Indian technology firms like HCL Technologies) for the development and testing of some of the 737 MAX’s broader software systems. Kill the visa altogether. The only fair solution. Tech companies have been feeding at the trough for 30 years! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Kill the damn thing!!! Yes, but that had nothing to do with the crashes. The MCAS module that caused the crashes was designed, built and tested inhouse by their core engineering team. We may never know for certain.

Title: EA’s $55 Billion Buyout Sets New ‘Going Private’ High Score

The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic, but its rapid growth didn’t continue once consumers could go outside and touch grass. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Video game-maker Electronic Arts has agreed to go private for $55 billion in the biggest-ever buyout of a public company. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, along with private equity firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, will pay $210 per share to EA’s investors. That’s nearly 25% more than what the stock was worth before The Wall Street Journal reported details of the deal on Friday. EA has been making popular titles like “The Sims” and “Madden NFL” for decades. But recent years have left the company floundering like a Sim in a pool with no ladder. The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic, but its rapid growth didn’t continue once consumers could go outside and touch grass, en masse, again. EA contracted with the broader industry, reducing its workforce through several rounds of layoffs, shutting down development studios and canceling games. The company’s stock experienced its biggest single-day slide in 17 years in January after executives slashed annual bookings guidance. The problem: Free-to-play games like “Fortnite” dominate the gaming industry, not $80 console titles. Plus, games like EA’s upcoming “Battlefield 6” are under immense pressure to succeed since they cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. So EA’s switching its focus: Pressing Buttons: The massive buyout of EA could spark investor interest in gaming companies: Shares of EA and other gaming companies, including Take-Two and Roblox, rose yesterday. But the deal has a vital level to complete first: regulatory approval. Regulators may question whether the Saudi fund’s involvement raises national security concerns. EA’s games have a trove of data on American gamers that goes beyond their “Battlefield” kill/death ratios. The Saudi fund has been expanding its gaming interests with sizable stakes in EA and rival gaming company Take-Two Interactive, as well as acquiring the gaming division of Pokémon Go-maker Niantic. Saudi Arabia also hosted the Esports World Cup last year. Universal and Warner are said to be pushing AI startups to develop an attribution system that can track when an artists’ music is used. Lame duck Disney CEO Bob Iger will likely have his hands full with pressure from regulators and investors in his remaining days on the job. Tying its various advertising tech services together has allowed Google to snare roughly 20% of each dollar that moves through its platforms. Lachlan Murdoch’s moves so far are clearly those of someone who came of age during an era of rapidly advancing digitization. Whether it pursues the box office or not, Netflix is clearly interested in catering to the extroverts among us. ESPN’s standalone streaming service is finally here, but it’s core audience may have already found a preferred way to watch sports. Advertising companies are scrambling to make changes as their businesses get hammered by advances in artificial intelligence. Vegas has been dealing with the economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration’s trade, tariff and immigration policies. Revenue from theme parks in the US rose 10% to $6.4 billion, with passenger cruises and resort stays registering higher turnout. Warner Bros. Discovery entered the year stuck in media conglomerate mud, with its eponymous film studio in especially bad shape. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Meta CMO says there are 3 things that will determine whether AI causes companies to grow or shrink head count

Every time Henry publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Artificial intelligence will likely destroy some jobs — and create some new ones. Whether that nets out to a head count reduction or an increase at any given company ultimately boils down to a few factors, Meta's CMO says. Alex Schultz has worked at Meta for almost two decades, starting at Facebook as an analyst and working his way up to chief marketing officer. The company has undergone significant changes over the years, from a pandemic-era hiring boom to layoffs during Mark Zuckerberg's "year of efficiency" and, most recently, a costly AI poaching spree. On "The A16z Podcast," Schultz said that there were three factors determining whether AI would cause companies to grow or shrink their workforce. First, Schultz said that AI would enable workers to perform existing tasks more efficiently — something that could lead to a company's headcount shrinking. "Existing stuff is going to be done more efficiently with AI as it exists today," Schultz said. "A lot of stuff can be automated, a lot of stuff can be done more efficiently. So that work, there will be less of it." There are already signs of that playing out at some major tech giants. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that he expected AI efficiency gains to reduce the company's corporate workforce. These AI efficiency cuts are leading to what some refer to as the "Great Shrinking." On the other side of the equation are work-creating possibilities from AI advancements. Schultz's second factor is the creation of work that was previously unimaginable. "Things that literally weren't possible before will become possible," he said. "That can open up a lot more jobs." Schultz used the example of "semantic understanding of content," which bettered content ranking and could not exist without AI. A handful of previously unheard-of job titles have emerged from the AI boom. AI trainers are earning lucrative contracts, while prompt engineers are discerning the best ways to interact with AI. Some companies are hiring guidance positions to vet AI vendors and explain tools to the workforce. Schultz's third factor surrounds cost-prohibitive work. AI may open up the possibility for these new projects. "Things that were possible, but just were really effing expensive, suddenly become over the threshold of reasonable to do," he said. Schultz uses the example of support chatbots. Before, you could have built a customer support bot, Schultz said, but it was "prohibitively expensive." Now, AI can do it — and people can build the system, creating new work. How it ultimately shakes out at a company comes down to the result of that equation. Will the head count shrinkage from efficiency gains outweigh the growth from new (or newly affordable) work growth? Answering that will determine the labor outcomes, Schultz said. That is, if artificial general intelligence (AGI) doesn't come first, which Schultz said would disrupt the full equation. "It depends how weird you think it's going to get," he said. Jump to

Title: Companies Are Lying About AI Layoffs

Companies are saying that the economy and AI are causing the large amount of tech layoffs, but Vanessa Wingårdh looked at the H-1B visa data and noticed that the companies are lying. She argues that the American employees are being replaced by cheaper H-1B visa workers. WSJ also reported on this due to some senators speaking up. As proof she uses the H-1B data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. When filtering by fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, the number of Beneficiaries Approved for some of the big corporations as of 30 June 2025 are shown in the second column below. I also searched a bit for news articles about layoffs and put those numbers in the third column. A commenter on Hacker News writes: "You can go on Blind, Fishbowl, any work related subreddit, etc. and hear the same story over and over and over - 'My company replaced half my department with H1Bs or simply moved it to an offshore center in India, and then on the next earnings call announced that they had replaced all those jobs with AI'." I searched a bit to verify these claims and it seems plausible since I could without much effort find a report from Boeing in the 2000s, and that indeed the replacing of US workers by H-1Bs seems commonly agreed upon here, here, and here. Another commenter pointed out that Accenture proposed hiring 12,000 employees in a new campus in India.

Title: The Benefit Of Walmart CEO Doug McMillon’s AI Warning In The Workplace
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2025/09/29/the-benefit-of-walmart-ceo-doug-mcmillons-ai-warning-in-the-workplace/

ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. When Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told conference attendees that “artificial intelligence is going to change literally every job,” remarks later reported by The Wall Street Journal, it was easy to interpret his words as a dire warning. And it is, but hidden in that warning is a benefit CEOs can’t afford to ignore. AI isn’t just another tech wave, as it’s a force already reshaping skills, workflows, cultures, and career paths across industries. The question isn’t whether disruption will hit your company; it’s whether your organization can adapt fast enough to stay relevant and competitive. Much like in health, where stress can either accelerate decline or build strength depending on the quality of preparation, AI presents leaders with the same choice. Viewed reactively, it erodes, but viewed proactively, it strengthens. In an interview with The Associated Press, McMillon stressed that many roles aren’t disappearing. Instead, they’re being “plussed up.” Rather than imagining a hollowed-out workforce, leaders can see AI as an amplifier that reshapes jobs rather than eliminates them. This reframing is significant as it shifts the narrative from one of scarcity to one of abundance. If jobs evolve instead of disappear, organizations gain the opportunity to redesign how work is done, how employees develop, and how performance is evaluated. It mirrors what happens in health and performance: stressors are neutral. A workout can build strength or cause injury, depending on proper preparation and a solid initial foundation. Likewise, AI can either expand opportunities or create obsolescence, depending on whether leaders build organizations resilient enough to adapt. McMillon’s warning is ultimately a reminder that organizational relevance in the AI era depends on three traits: skill diversification, adaptability, and continuous learning. They are the workplace equivalents of oxygen, metabolism, and muscle growth. And together, they protect an organization’s most valuable currency: its people. A diverse nutritional palate strengthens your body, and diverse skills strengthen your workplace. Walmart has leaned into skills-based training, even offering truck drivers advanced technical courses to ensure roles evolve rather than disappear. The same pattern is happening everywhere. According to LinkedIn’s 2025 Guide to Future-Proofing Your Career, 85% of U.S. professionals could see at least a quarter of their skills reshaped by AI. Organizations that cling to static job descriptions, credential-based hiring, and outdated cultural norms risk fragility. Those who build broad skill ecosystems create antifragility and ultimately stand out in the market. In biology, metabolism determines whether stress fuels growth or decline. In organizations, adaptability plays the same role. McMillon’s framing of jobs as “plussed up” depicts how disruption can be reframed as evolution. Instead of defaulting to mass layoffs, an adaptable organization can redesign workflows that complement human judgment, creativity, empathy, and other unique human traits with AI’s speed and scale. These companies can thus further improve their performance while also attracting top talent. Humans extend their healthspan and lifespan through lifelong learning, which involves exercising their muscles, training their brains, and refining habits over the course of decades. Organizations extend their relevance in the same way. LinkedIn data reveals AI literacy has grown 100% year-over-year, with certifications and retraining surging among other developments. Continuous learning is no longer optional; it’s an essential compounding mechanism for corporate survival. Companies that fail to embed it into their organizational DNA risk stagnant performance and losing top talent to competitors who prioritize growth. McMillon isn’t alone. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy have echoed similar views: AI will stress every workplace system. But stress itself is neutral, as the outcome depends on whether CEOs have built the infrastructure to turn it into growth. Just as individuals extend their healthspan by investing in habits that pay dividends over time, leaders must extend their organization’s relevance by treating skills, adaptability, and learning as core assets. Doug McMillon’s warning is worth heeding not because it signals an end, but because it offers a blueprint for the evolution required in the next era of business.

September 29, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has secured a second multi-launch contract with Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan. The new contract for a further 10 dedicated Electron launches brings the total number of upcoming Synspective missions to 21 – marking the largest order of dedicated Electron missions with a single customer to date. Following the first launch agreement announced in June 2024, this second multi-launch contract within 18 months further solidifies Electron’s international expansion and leadership of the small lift launch market globally. This latest contract secures the launch of 21 StriX SAR satellites across multiple missions through to the end of the decade. Rocket Lab has been Synspective’s sole launch provider to-date, successfully deploying six StriX satellites across six dedicated launches from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. The next 21 Synspective launches will take place from the same launch site, with Rocket Lab’s schedule flexibility, tailored launch service, and streamlined operations central to Synspective’s decision to extend its previous multi-launch contract. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Regular and reliable launch on a flexible schedule is essential to the build out of Synspective’s constellation, and Electron has been integral to this from the start as the sole launcher of all StriX satellites in space today. It’s an honor to add another 10 StriX satellites to Electron’s launch manifest and continue our long-standing partnership with Synspective.” Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, said: “Rocket Lab’s precision and track record have consistently enabled us to stay on schedule and achieve our mission objectives. As we move forward with 21 launches, our continued collaboration is crucial to accelerating the deployment of our SAR satellites and the growth of our data platform.” Electron’s reliability, proficiency at executing against rapid timelines, and satellite deployment accuracy to within meters of its target, has made it the commercial launch vehicle of choice for satellite operators wanting to build out their constellations with precision. The majority of Electron launches this year have either been the continuation of multi-launch contracts with commercial constellation customers, or have completed the entire deployment of a constellation in less than a year.

On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

September 29, 2025 16:03 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Economic uncertainty lingers at the edge of markets, but it hasn't done much to dent the wild enthusiasm for AI in 2025. The frenzy is still mainly seen in the market's biggest stocks. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 40% in six months, compared to a gain of 20% for the S&P 500 in that time. However, the rally is broadening, and other winners are emerging as the AI buildout accelerates. Analysts at Futurum Group, a market research and intelligence firm, flagged a list of stocks they see as most likely to outperform the most popular names in the next chapter of the AI boom. Here are five tech stocks it sees as the big winners as the rally extends beyond the Magnificent Seven. Ticker: AVGO Year-to-date gain: 43% Analyst's view: Futurum analysts describe Broadcom as the "Uncle Sam of AI," due to its ability to tax many aspects of AI inference, earning it the No. 1 spot on its ranking. "In a world where every AI token costs someone money, Broadcom isn't just supplying parts, but they are becoming the toll collector across silicon, networking, and software, taking a cut from every layer of the stack." Ticker: PLTR Year-to-date gain: 137% Analyst's view: While Palantir stock has stumbled in recent weeks, leading to a spike in bearish sentiment, Futurum's analysts aren't worried. "Palantir has emerged as the execution layer of AI, not selling models or dashboards but decision engines that fuse data, policy, and action across government, defense, and enterprise." Ticker: ORCL Year-to-date gain: 70% Analyst's view: One of the season's breakout tech stocks, Oracle has been in focus since a bullish revenue forecast sent shares surging. Futurum sees it as the core player in the industry, praising its strength as a fundamental enterprise AI provider. "Where others rent compute, Oracle ties it to data by being that structural edge as AI moves from prototype to production," the report said. "That edge is now scaled by numbers that rival hyperscalers." Ticker: NBIS Year-to-date gain: 295% Analyst's view: An unknown AI utility company until recently, Nebius stock surged on September 9 on news that it had inked a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, and Futurum sees the Netherlands-based company playing a pivotal role in the AI economy. "Nebius isn't competing with hyperscalers on breadth. It's competing on the physical and economic constraints that define AI compute: power, cooling, and integration." Ticker: MBD Year-to-date gain: 31% Analyst's view: Over the past two quarters, MongoDB stock has surged as Atlas, its enterprise platform, has helped drive significant revenue growth. Futurum highlighted the platform's ability to help large-scale companies simplify AI applications. "That evolution is why Mongo is winning critical workloads and why it's becoming the memory layer of AI, the bridge between messy enterprise data and agentic systems that require structured retrieval."

An analyst's concerns about demand for Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drugs is weighing on the drugmaker's shares to start the week. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) slid in recent trading following a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, which raised concerns about demand for the company's GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as their effectiveness in fighting Alzheimer’s disease. The bank dropped its rating to “underweight” from “equal weight,” and lowered the price target to $47 from $59. The stock was recently down less than 1% to below $55, slightly extending year-to-date declines. Morgan Stanley has downgraded Novo Nordisk, whose U.S. shares are already down a third this year. That downgrade forecasts slowing demand for weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, generic competition abroad, and trial results that may disappoint those looking for an Alzheimer’s breakthrough. Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients that “prescriptions for Ozempic and Wegovy have been stagnating in the US; we forecast a decline in the US GLP-1 diabetes franchise in 2026 due to market share and price pressure, and we expect Ozempic ex-US growth to be impacted by the first generic competition in Canada and emerging markets.” The analysts said that they believe the results of trials of Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 treatments for Alzheimer’s disease coming in the next few week will likely fall short of showing statistically significant outcomes. AndtThey warned about the downside risks of potential price cuts for Ozempic and Wegovy in Medicare Part D plans, as well as doubts about the company’s experimental obesity/diabetes combination drug CagriSemi outperforming rival Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost a third of their value this year.

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:Vanguard Rivals Finally Get Hands On Its Tax-Busting Fund Design “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs.

Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) “Now that the SEC has signed off, the real work will begin. There’s matters of logistics, economics and the economics of logistics to attend to and it will likely be years before we see ETF share classes proliferate and become broadly and easily accessible via conversions of existing mutual fund share class holdings,” said Morningstar’s Ben Johnson. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. The decision is a potential watershed moment for US money managers, more than 70 of which have sought permission from the SEC to adopt the dual-class structure.

Change of Pace Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s acting chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “Mutual fund-class shareholders could benefit through lower transaction costs and greater tax efficiency, while ETF-class shareholders could also benefit from more efficient rebalancing using mutual fund cash flows and lower total portfolio transaction costs,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm at Dimensional, said in a press release. Big Shake Up The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse. Some experts caution that the change could erode some key benefits of the ETF wrapper, especially if these hybrid funds face steep withdrawals during market meltdowns. A study from research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that fund distributors like wirehouses and broker dealers risk losing between $15 billion and $30 billion a year in fees that they currently collect from the mutual funds if those funds convert into the ETF share class. Still, the SEC’s potential approval could give a lifeline to firms whose mutual funds are suffering outflows as investors choose ETFs. In 2024, mutual funds shed a net $451 billion, while their exchange-traded counterparts — which typically offer superior tax efficiency and liquidity — took in a record $1.1 trillion, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. “Now that the SEC has signed off, the real work will begin. There’s matters of logistics, economics and the economics of logistics to attend to and it will likely be years before we see ETF share classes proliferate and become broadly and easily accessible via conversions of existing mutual fund share class holdings,” said Morningstar’s Ben Johnson.

September 29, 2025 10:44 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Autonomous Drones" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the fast-evolving autonomous drone landscape, examining how advancements in AI, computer vision, and connectivity are propelling drones from risk-reduction tools into core infrastructure for industrial efficiency, safety, and business continuity. It explores how autonomy levels (L1-L5) are enabling zero-touch operations, swarm coordination, and AI-driven mission execution across diverse sectors. Autonomous drones are moving from risk reduction to driving operational efficiency, with industries adopting them as critical infrastructure rather than pilot projects. Mining operators are deploying drone-in-a-box ODAS platforms for safety and monitoring, energy firms are using AI-guided drones for real-time emissions detection, and retailers such as Walmart are scaling delivery fleets under supportive frameworks like the FAA's BVLOS sandbox and China's real-name drone registration policy.Momentum is reinforced by investment and innovation. Anduril's funding expands defense autonomy, while Skydio's FAA-approved X10 dock enables fully remote inspections. Pioneers such as Maersk and Voliro are overcoming operational barriers. Patent activity is shifting toward GPS-denied navigation and hybrid aerial-ground drones, while deal values surged to $32.7B in H1 2025, reflecting strong confidence in autonomy-first ecosystems.The report examines sector-specific deployments across defense, mining, energy, retail, logistics, and industrial goods, alongside regulatory developments, market signals, and innovations shaping the next phase of drone autonomy.Autonomous drones are moving from risk reduction to driving operational efficiency. With mining companies deploying autonomous obstacle detection and avoidance system (ODAS) drone-in-a-box offerings and energy firms using AI-guided inspection drones, various industries are now entrusting critical safety and asset monitoring to autonomous drone fleets. This is improving efficiency and business continuity. AI and autonomy unlock new productivity frontiers. Innovators like Skydio, whose docked X10 drones are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved for fully remote, beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) infrastructure inspections, and energy operators using real-time AI emission detectors, are proving how drone automation can replace manual monitoring with smarter, round-the-clock operations. Investment and hiring surge fuel the ecosystem's scale-up. Anduril raised $2.5 billion in funding in 2025 to expand autonomous defense platforms. This, combined with aggressive hiring from JD.com and Skydio around automation and analytics roles, illustrates how boardroom conviction and workforce expansion are powering rapid advances in autonomous drone platforms and accelerating their commercial rollout across sectors. New policies are unlocking larger-scale autonomous drone operations. With the creation of the FAA's BVLOS sandbox and China's real-name drone registration opening up airspace, firms like Walmart and Vodafone are now scaling autonomous delivery and inspection fleets, moving drone automation from controlled pilots into everyday, revenue-generating business models. Pioneers break through adoption barriers with real-world results. Companies such as Voliro in industrial inspections and Maersk in offshore asset monitoring are overcoming regulatory and operational hurdles through all-in-one autonomous systems and robust policy support, positioning autonomous drones as essential infrastructure for global enterprises.Key Highlights Scope Reasons to Buy Strategic Insights Technology Analysis Innovation Landscape Market Dynamics Sector-Specific Applications Competitive Intelligence Strategic Recommendations With autonomy now operational rather than aspirational, this report equips stakeholders with the intelligence needed to harness drones as a foundation for smarter, safer, and more resilient industries.Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/maas2o About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels After Stock Surged 20% Last Week

Intel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments. The stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company. Analysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring. Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week. Importantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023. Let’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range. A successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year. Finally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.

Title: The GOOGL Stock Shareholder Jackpot

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past 10 years, Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has provided an impressive $343 billion to its shareholders through actual cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has accelerated dramatically in 2025, with the stock delivering an exceptional 30% return year-to-date, substantially outperforming the broader market and cementing its position among the year's top-performing mega-cap technology stocks. Alphabet's evolution into a dividend-paying powerhouse reached a milestone this year when the company announced a 5% increase to its quarterly dividend in April 2025, raising the payout to $0.21 per share from the inaugural $0.20 dividend introduced in 2024 - marking the tech giant's transformation from a pure growth story to a balanced capital allocation champion. The company's commitment to rewarding shareholders was further amplified through the authorization of a massive $70 billion share repurchase program in Q1 2025, one of the largest buyback announcements in corporate history, demonstrating management's confidence in the business amid robust financial performance. During the first half of 2025 alone, Alphabet generated impressive revenue growth with Q1 revenues of $90.23 billion (up 12% year-over-year) and Q2 revenues reaching $96.4 billion (up 14% year-over-year), providing the cash flow foundation that enables both aggressive capital returns and continued investment in AI infrastructure and cloud computing expansion. Let’s examine some figures and see how this payout capability compares with the substantial capital-return entities in the market. This provides a solid summary, but assessing a stock from an investment perspective entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to do. It is structured to mitigate stock-specific risks while allowing for potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – Why MSFT Stock Is A Shareholder's Paradise? Why is the shareholder return important? Because dividends and share repurchases constitute direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also demonstrate management’s confidence in the financial health of the company and its ability to generate reliable cash flows. Furthermore, more companies exhibit similar traits. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital delivered back to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. Interestingly, GOOGL ranks 3rd for the highest amount returned to shareholders in history. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What observations can you make? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as META and MSFT are experiencing much faster growth in a more predictable manner compared to others, yet they have provided a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That’s the trade-off associated with substantial capital returns. While they may seem appealing, it's essential to question: Am I compromising growth and solid fundamentals? With that in mind, let's examine GOOGL's performance. (Refer to Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock for further information) Nevertheless, GOOGL is not without the risk of significant declines. It dropped 65% during the Global Financial Crisis, lost roughly 44% in the inflation shock, and encountered a 31% pullback during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even more minor corrections, like in 2018, resulted in a decrease of about 23%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during periods of volatility, even leading stocks can experience turmoil. Also, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Grab Stock To $4?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Grab Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRAB), Southeast Asia’s foremost super-app for ride-hailing, deliveries, and digital payments, has experienced a surge in 2025, rising approximately 30% year-to-date to around $6.25 per share. However, as investors ponder whether the stock could double, there is another equally significant question: could Grab’s upward momentum diminish and the stock dip back down towards $4? Let’s delve into the argument. If you are searching for upside potential with reduced volatility compared to owning an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—which is a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns surpassing 91% since its launch. In addition, check out – The Roller Coaster Ride Of Opendoor Stock? Grab reported a gross merchandise value (GMV) of $7.9 billion for 2024, with revenues totaling around $2.2 billion—representing a slower rate than during its early growth phase. While ride-hailing is on the mend, food delivery has moderated, and fintech remains a burden on profits. At a price of $6.25 per share, Grab trades at approximately 3.5x forward sales, which is below that of global competitors like Uber. Nonetheless, if revenue growth continues to float in the mid-single digits and margins stay exceedingly thin, investors may apply a stricter discount. A multiple nearer to 2x sales would suggest a share price close to $4, significantly lower than the current price. The essential insight: Grab doesn’t require a collapse to experience a decline. A slight disappointment in growth or profitability might be enough to recalibrate expectations. At $6.25 per share, Grab has staged a commendable rally in 2025, but the risk of a retraction persists. If growth continues to stabilize and fintech losses accumulate, the stock could regress back towards $4. On the other hand, stronger margin improvements and increased digital banking adoption could validate today’s valuation—or potentially elevate it further. For investors, Grab is still a narrative of substantial potential but also considerable execution risk. At $6.25, the stock reflects a recovery. At $4, it would hint at skepticism about the profitability of the super-app model. Its future trajectory will depend on Grab's ability to turn market dominance into sustainable earning strength. Investors should brace for considerable volatility and the chance of significant losses if market conditions worsen or if the company fails to realize its ambitious growth objectives. While the 2x upside potential is mathematically sound based on projected revenues, it necessitates flawless execution within a rapidly shifting and competitive environment. Now, we implement a risk assessment framework while structuring the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a strong history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks resulted in better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Why Did Reddit Stock Drop 10%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/29/why-did-reddit-stock-drop-10/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Reddit stock (NYSE:RDDT) dropped nearly 10% in the past week, in contrast to the nearly stable performance of the S&P 500 Index. The fluctuations in Reddit’s stock price are particularly notable when compared to its competitors, including Meta Platforms – which fell about 3% during the week, Snap – gaining around 8%, and Pinterest – which dropped approximately 3%. The decline is indicative of investor worries regarding slower user growth and possible traffic challenges related to updates in Google’s search algorithms and AI-generated responses, which may impact engagement and advertising capacity on the platform. With the current share price hovering around $237, we believe Reddit could experience short-term challenges before stabilizing. Importantly, the stock is still significantly higher compared to its IPO valuation from early 2024 and has increased by 45% since late 2024, as outlined in our analysis of Why Reddit Stock Moved. However, for those looking for growth with less volatility than owning a single stock, the High Quality Portfolio is worth considering. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark, which consists of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns of over 91% since its launch. As a whole, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, don’t miss – Uber Stock To $200? Some of the increase in Reddit’s stock since its IPO can be attributed to the approximately 30% rise in its revenues from 2022 to 2024. Revenue growth surged in 2023 due to the introduction of new ad products and licensing agreements, and this trend continued into 2024 with ongoing growth in advertising and AI-related data licensing. Nevertheless, growth started to slow somewhat in early 2025 amid worries regarding traffic sources and user engagement patterns. Although Reddit has experienced steady revenue growth, its PS multiple has not broadened significantly. The company's PS multiple rose from around 10x in 2024 to almost 12x by mid-2025. While the company’s PS is currently above historical averages, there may be potential downside when comparing the current multiple to previous peaks – roughly 15x in late 2024 and closer to 9x as recently as early 2023. In its latest quarter, Reddit declared revenue of approximately $240 million, reflecting an increase of more than 20% year-over-year, and recorded its second quarterly profit since its IPO. However, the daily active users count of 100 million was slightly under optimistic forecasts, raising concerns about market saturation and competition. For the full year of 2025, Reddit has projected revenue growth in the mid-20% range, but remarks regarding traffic uncertainty have made investors cautious. If the company can demonstrate resilience in user engagement and continue to enhance its ad products, the stock could potentially regain its upward trajectory. However, in the short term, volatility is expected to remain as investors weigh high valuation multiples against execution risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark inclusive of all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap — and has generated returns above 91% since its inception. What accounts for this success? As a collective, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio deliver better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

While the Trump administration’s recent $100,000 fee for H1-B visas have received the lion’s share of the attention due to potential effects in the tech and healthcare fields, there was a recent policy change for lowly agricultural guest workers that shows how the administration’s immigrant worker plan is coming full circle. As we predicted, after targeting humanitarian parole, temporary protected status, and other immigrant workers, the administration is now relaxing rules for H2-A “guest workers,” a program which has been called “close to slavery.” Back in July, the administration put in place stringent in-person interview requirements for a wide range of visa holders and applicants. Only two months later, they are lifting the requirement for guest agricultural workers. Now, this could simply be an admission of error by the administration which is getting complaints about crops rotting and realizing it made a mistake. It’s more likely this was the plan as it’s what workers have been warning against and such a move fits with Trump’s priors. Are H2-B workers—those “guest” laborers in non-agricultural fields that Trump’s businesses rely on—next to be waved on in by the administration? That, too, looks increasingly likely. Key to understanding this mega project of workforce engineering by the administration is understanding who is being targeted by ICE, deported, and who is being waved into the US while others encounter roadblocks. Let’s take a look. Who Among the Immigrant Workforce Is Being Targeted for Removal About 40 percent of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented. Here’s how the makeup looks: As of 2020 there were more than 406,000 individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to reside and work legally in the US due to unsafe conditions in their home country—usually with an assist from US interference ala regime change efforts or direct military involvement. The similar humanitarian parole covered another 530,000-plus. According to FERN: Another 1.7 million people work in food processing plants, per the USDA. Many are refugees, and approximately 19% are in the country without authorization, according to the New American Economy research group. In the largest food processing segment, meatpacking, the American Immigration Council estimates that 45% of all workers are immigrants and around 23% are unauthorized. While the administration goes after the unauthorized, It is also trying to get rid of TPS and humanitarian parole. Trump suspended all refugee resettlement programs via executive order save for white South African “refugees.” The Department of Homeland Security also removed Afghanistan and Venezuela from the TPS list and is trying to axe Haiti as well. That means more than 9,000 Afghan, 300,000 Venezuelan, and 200,000 Haitians in the US can be legally deported. There is a heavy concentration of TPS holders in the meatpacking industry. As of 2020, roughly 15,600 worked on farms or in food processing.The United Food & Commercial Workers union warned months ago that deportations or threats of deporation could lead to the meat shortages and price increases that we currently seeing (although there are other factors). From Investigate Midwest: Increased immigration enforcement has scared many immigrants—legal or not– into staying home after the Supreme Court allowed ICE to target people based on skin color For example, in Beardstown, Illinois, many workers at the meat processing plant were legally in the U.S. under humanitarian parole programs, but the Trump administration revoked their status. At first the administration said it was going after people with criminal records rather than conduct mass workplace raids. But there was no way that path was going to get to the stated goal of 1 million deportations by the end of the year. And so food production sites became a prime target. Yes, these raids target unauthorized immigrants. They also set back the country’s food system. Designed to Fail Recall that the administration’s plan was based not only on getting rid of workers who had built lives in the US, many of whom were trying to improve their lot through unionization efforts, but also snatching Medicaid away from all the loafers out there. This was going to somehow magically get Americans out into the fields and into the slaughterhouses despite all the evidence to the contrary. Here’s Scott Morgenstern, a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has predicted that farm owners will soon find plenty of U.S. citizens to employ. She declared on July 8 that the new Medicaid work requirements included in the same legislative package as the immigration enforcement funds would encourage huge numbers of U.S. citizens to start working in the fields instead of losing their health insurance through that government program. Farm trade groups say this scenario is far-fetched. For one thing, most adults enrolled in the Medicaid program who can work already do. Many others are unable to do so due to disabilities or caregiving obligations. Few people enrolled in Medicaid live close enough to a farm to work at one, and even those who do aren’t capable of doing farmwork. When farm owners tried putting people enrolled in a welfare program to work in the fields in the 1990s, it failed. Another experiment in the 1960s, which deployed teenagers, didn’t pan out either because the teens found the work too hard. Notably one strategy not employed by the administration is requiring higher wages and improved worker conditions. And so unsurprisingly federal labor data shows a 7% drop in the US agriculture workforce between March and July, equal to roughly 155,000 workers. Predictably, the Trump administration is turning to H2-A guest workers. In June, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the creation of the Office of Immigration Policy, which the labor secretary said will be a “one-stop shop” to help employers meet their labor needs.. And then on September 18, the State Department declared that H2-A visa holders no long must attend an in-person interview to renew their visas within 12 months of the expiration of their old one. It wouldn’t be surprising if H2-B workers are next to be waved in, perhaps based on slaughterhouse worker shortages, but also beneficial for people like Trump who employs the guest workers at his properties. Industry “stakeholders” are applauding the H2-A move, and they are asking for more—particularly longer term work permits, which are still tied to an individual’s labor and mean the employer has near complete control over the worker. In effect what’s happening is a trading out of people for exploitable workers. In the tech world, the AI bubble might be an avalanche of slop, but is useful in another way. Take Amazon, which claimed AI was taking jobs when it conducted mass layoffs only to turn around and replace those workers with cheaper H1-B alternatives. In the case of the agriculture and service sector industries, we have the government doing the heavy lifting removing immigrants and refugeesn who aren’t exploitable enough and replacing them with H2-A and H2-B alternatives. Why Capital Loves Guest Workers A crucial difference between the migrant H-2B and H-2A workers and immigrants who live and work in the US under temporary protected status or humanitarian parole is that the latter two categories didn’t have their ability to stay in the country legally tied to their work. That made them less exploitable. They were free to change jobs and unionize. That’s probably a big reason they’re being targeted for deportation. Trump has suggested that unauthorized immigrants and refugees who had built lives in the US could potentially return legally, but the administration has not provided specifics. It’s pretty clear what he means. Edgar Franks, the political director of Familias Unidas, summed it up in April—an assessment that is now shared by the likes of the AFL-CIO’s Department of People Who Work for a Living and other unions: It was meant to silence the organizing, deport as many people as possible, and to bring in a captive workforce through the H-2A program. We think that might be the ultimate plan: to get rid of all the immigrant workers who are organizing and fighting back for better conditions, and to bring in a workforce that’s under the complete control of their employer with basically no rights. Franks prediction is steadily being realized. And to back up his claim, it’s pretty remarkable how efficiently ICE and the administration target unauthorized or refugee workers who are unionized or organizing. Some examples: The United Farm Workers labor union has condemned the raid at the farm that the UFW has been actively organizing in since 2022. Of the 14 workers detained at the May 2 raid, ten were ultimately deported. UFW Secretary Treasurer Armando Elenes labels the raids as “shameful employer complicity in the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate legal protections and lower wages for farm workers.” “A legally-binding union contract has already been awarded at Lynn-Ette by a NY State-appointed arbitrator, yet Lynn-Ette is defying the law and refusing to implement this union contract,” states Elenes. As of 2024 there were 384,900 H2-A and 215,217 H2-B workers in the US—numbers that have been steadily increasing for decades and especially over the past 15 years with a more than fivefold increase since 2010. With the administration’s early moves, this number is set to increase even further. In theory, the foreign workers who obtain H-2A visas are supposed to be guaranteed relatively high wages, as well as housing in the U.S. In reality, it is not enforced, and they are left to the whims of their employers. Because they are basically indentured servants they are loved by Trump and many employers. Even the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security “acknowledge that H-2B workers face structural disincentives to reporting or leaving abusive conditions, and often lack power to exercise their rights in the face of exploitative employment situations.” The Food & Environment Reporting Network with more: …these visas are notoriously abusive to foreign workers. That’s because they effectively create a captive workforce: In contrast to other immigrant workers in the U.S. — including recipients of certain humanitarian programs, like TPS — H-2 workers’ presence in the country is tied to a particular job and employer. H-2 employees are eligible to work for whoever sponsors their visa, and it can be prohibitively difficult for them to switch jobs even if they’re mistreated. If they quit, they’re sent back to their home countries, which would ruin many H-2 workers and their families financially. (Over half of all H-2A farmworkers enter the country in debt to illegal recruiters, who charge fees for connecting workers with job contracts.) H2-A guest workers also faced a major setback in their fight to organize last year when a District Court Judge issued an injunction in August that blocked them from unionizing in 17 states. The guest worker program also features labor trafficking, rampant wage fraud, illegal recruitment fees, wage theft, and illegal threats of retaliation. Abuse is made easy by the fact that it’s almost impossible for workers to quit their jobs since their visas are tied to a single employer. Mike Rios, a DOL regional agricultural enforcement coordinator, describes the H2 program as the “literal purchase of humans.” But it’s not just the guest workers who suffer. Pain (Nearly) All Around The guest worker program might be beneficial for individual employers, but it is drain for American society. From Investigate Midwest: Undocumented immigrants paid $100 billion in taxes in 2022, without enjoying any of the benefits, such as Social Security or Medicare. Living in communities, they also contribute to local economies. Temporary visa workers, on the other hand, send most of the money they earn to their home countries. It’s also bad for all workers, including those those Americans who were supposed to take the place of immigrants and refugees. The Food & Environment Reporting Network: H-2 workers have so little bargaining power that some employers prefer to hire them over U.S. citizens — which ends up disenfranchising the American-born workers Trump and Miller say their deportations will benefit. Under federal law, employers must show they were unable to hire American workers before they’re approved to hire H-2 workers, but some employers circumvent that rule and commit visa fraud to avoid hiring Americans at higher rates. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has filed a string of complaints with the DOL, alleging that meatpacking companies have repeatedly requested increased allocations of H-2B workers as a way of undercutting wages. What about all those workers who have lived and labored here for years and in some cases decades? There’s a reason that immigration question was never settled as described here by Michael Macher: …the US immigration system runs not on the enforcement of immigration laws, but on their selective nonenforcement. Employers have relied on the state to ignore the exploitation of undocumented labor while holding the credible threat of deportation over workers. This has had the effect of strengthening employer bargaining power generally against all workers—lowering wages, weakening unions, and shifting the politics of work away from collective bargaining and wage-and-hour regulation. The interest in labor that is weak and disorganized has driven US politicians, consciously or not, to adopt the role of petty bosses, threatening the deportation of significant portions of the US workforce. Trump might be in the process of blowing up that system by turning the role of petty bosses back to the actual bosses, and he’s able to do that now because labor is so weakened after a half century of losses in the class war. Even the crumbs are now being snatched away. Weak—and in some cases counterproductive from a labor viewpoint—agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are being further crippled. And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” That means that as of now any effort from workers and unions to fight back, such as “illegal” strikes, can now be labeled “anti-capitalist” and the weight of the police state will come crashing down on them. Public sector unions are already in retreat. Immigrants who were part of communities, and in many cases unions, are being shown the door only to be replaced by indentured servants often housed away from society in squalid prison-like housing. Trump is dutifully playing his role as an accelerant and looking to make a bad program worse: The Biden administration changed the methodology for calculating the rate for H-2A workers, which resulted in a larger pay increase for some of them this year. Some farm organizations, including the NCAE and the Farm Bureau, want the Trump administration to roll back that change and expand the H-2A program to cover year-round workers, especially for dairy and livestock farms. During Trump’s first term the temporary work visa programs steadily grew a total of 13 percent larger, and he used the Covid emergency to help make it happen: During the pandemic, his administration issued a series of emergency measures that made H-2A and H-2B visas more flexible and employer-friendly. Workers were allowed to stay in the country for longer periods of time, in part because they had been deemed “essential workers,” and wages for H-2A workers were effectively frozen. Trump 2.0 is using a crisis of its own creation in order to strengthen the guest worker program and hammer all of labor. Rather than better pay and working conditions to entice American workers, we’re getting an increase in guest workers to further drive down wages and worker protections. The house of labor, which has been burning for decades, is now being doused with Trump gasoline. And the capital-labor arrangement being steadily reinforced looks for Americans a lot like the immigrant experience. All workers must sell their labor for pennies on the dollar, accept unsafe conditions, and any other types of abuse or, in the case of immigrants, face deportation to foreign prisons. For Americans, the risk is becoming homeless and tossed into US (private) prisons. And with “anti-capitalist” beliefs now labeled as terrorism, workers face even more hurdles fighting back. Indentures and serfdom. Trump et al appear nostalgic for the days of proto-capitalism when the employer (lord of the manor) had near absolute power. It also brings to mind the Dickensian “dark satanic mill era” when wages were as close to starvation level as possible. But what is one to do? That’s capitalism in its purest form and who wants to be an Anti-capitalist in the US of A? Or maybe it’s just nostalgia for the Grapes of Wrath era which was less than 100 years ago. FDR may have sanded the rough edges off industrial capitalism but Big Ag has always had special power out in the heartland. And now we have Big Tech that also loves them some unskilled labor for their warehouses–picking products rather than vegetables. The solution to the immigration problem is simple. Employers should be required to pay foreign workers the same wages and benefits as American workers. Throughout history, immigrants have been welcomed not because ordinary citizens are tolerant but because capitalists have viewed them as a source of cheap labor. The H2a program has a higher wage floor built in – the adverse effect wage. Farms that employ H2a workers in my region often have higher pay than non-H2a employers. However, because farmers already feel like they are overpaying their guest workers, work and housing conditions suffer. B2S Workers want these jobs badly, and are willing to put up with a good amount of abuse in order to keep them, and given their lack of agency in the recruitment process, workers fear the next farm could be much worse. The Somalian and Cambodian refugees I have worked with have had the ability to quit and find new jobs. Not so for the Jamaican H2a workers. The importance of this factor in incentivizing farmers in improving work conditions cannot be overlooked. I await your silent empire, Tristero. Although in this curious instance, the foreigners were paid more. But the abusive conditions are present. Black Farmworkers Say They Lost Jobs to Foreigners Who Were Paid More (NY Times via archive.ph) From 2021 The reliance on South Africans may reflect the nature of agriculture and the demographics in the Mississippi Delta, compared with places like California. “In the Mississippi Delta, row-crop production requires fewer workers but workers who have skills to use machinery and equipment,” said Elizabeth Canales, an agricultural extension economist at Mississippi State University. “We hardly have any Latinos in this remote region. Naturally, it’s easier to hire South Africans where language will not be a barrier, especially because in this area, you have a very small Spanish-speaking population.” The South Africans arrived in the region willing to work weeks that sometimes stretched to 75 hours or more, grueling schedules that might have been difficult for older local workers to maintain, industry analysts said. “And the administration just launched a major new offensive in the class war with Trump’s national security directive labeling certain beliefs—including anti-capitalism— as “terrorism indicators.” Chris Hedges latest explains in detail what Trump’s directive will mean to you and me: https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/trumps-war-on-america A narrow slice of the H1-B program earns the ire of many. If jobs are narrowly posted so they are hidden from domestic workers and targeted toward foreign workers, there are some inequities. Domestic people get shafted, having to train their replacements, notoriously in IT, and foreigners may get jobs but at the costs noted of passport confiscation, abuse and other ills. Transparency would help. My opinion is that H-1B and Students were targeted because many become Pro Palestinian. May not even be Trump per say, but by those who control Congress Nip it in the bud as they say Thanks Conor! All the news is about ICE, harsh immigration crackdowns, and deportations to 3rd world hell holes. Very little news on H-2B visas, and virtually no news on H-2A visas, i.e. the real reason for the immigration crackdown. Labor organization, strikes, and any sort of anti capitalism protests are now considered gateway to terrorism activities that get you on a terrorism watchlist. Alligator Alcatraz and other US prison sites being built. Republican senators and members of congress silent and in hiding from their base. The Democrats have Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries leading their base in a silent and peaceful march into economic bondage. And the MAGA base continues to wear their “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” hats in blissful ignorance over the fact that they’ve been played bigtime. Only in America, the richest country ever, where the 1% still do not have enough to fill the bottomless pit in their collective souls, could this happen. Exactly why Democrat strategist Carville told the Party that playing possum would be hard, I imagine… when they “wake up” the daddy party will have gotten their own hands bloody with the troublesome left for the mommy party.

AI giant Anthropic is facing a possible head-on collision with the Trump administration — as concerns from conservatives multiply that the fast-growing firm carries a left-wing bias, The Post has learned. Investors in the San Francisco-based company — known for its popular Claude chatbot — include the Ford Foundation, a notoriously left-leaning group that bought $5 million worth of Anthropic shares in March 2024 in the bankruptcy of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, according to little-noticed court filings. Earlier this month, Vice President JD Vance called out the Ford Foundation by name while vowing to “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That’s after Anthropic recently irritated Trump officials by barring federal contractors from using its tools for some law enforcement purposes. Some at the White House have grumbled that Anthropic, whose CEO Dario Amodei is a prominent Democratic donor, could be “selectively enforcing its policies” due to differing political views, Semafor reported. Taken together, the two data points are likely to invite unwelcome scrutiny for Anthropic — even as rivals including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI have worked to curry favor with the White House, a source close to the Trump administration said. “When [the White House] is looking for a collaborative partner and suddenly they start being obstinate over White House objectives, and it comes to surface that they got a significant investment from a hostile political organization – which is what I would consider the Ford Foundation to be – I think you’re going to see a lot of eyebrows being raised,” the source added. Anthropic, whose backers include Amazon and Google, is competing with OpenAI, xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta for everything from lucrative federal contracts to crafting potential federal regulations around AI. But even before the latest flap over AI usage by federal contractors, Anthropic’s relationship with the White House – and key administration officials like AI czar David Sacks – was already seen as shaky at best. Anthropic’s Amodei called Trump a “feudal warlord” in a now-deleted social media post expressing support for Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. In 2018, he described Trump as a “serious and legitimate threat to the rule of law.” During a May episode of the popular “All In” podcast, Sacks said Anthropic was part of group of tech “doomers” that he described as “committed leftists” and “Trump haters” with ties to the effective altruism movement, which once counted Bankman-Fried among its elite backers. Sacks also pointed out that several ex-Biden administration staffers had joined Anthropic and that Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, a Democratic megadonor, was part of its board of directors. Amodei was one of the few tech honchos who skipped Trump’s inauguration in January, though he did attend an administration event about energy policy in Pittsburgh in July. He has also raised the hackles of some AI leaders with frequent warnings about the technology’s risks. Amodei has said executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur due to AI and suggested unemployment could hit 20%. He’s also warned of a 25% chance that things go “really, really badly” for humanity as AI gets more advanced. Daniela Amodei, his sister and a fellow co-founder of Anthropic, has a long history of donating to Democrats, include Harris, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. “When it comes to policy and trying to foment the golden age of American economic dominance, the White House is looking for partners who want to put America first and want to work together collaboratively,” the source close to the White House added. Despite its differences with the administration, Anthropic has secured a number of federal contracts – including a $200 million contract with the Department of War and a partnership with the US General Services Administration. Anthropic has also expressed support for the White House’s AI Action Plan, declaring it was “encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Anthropic’s valuation was just $18.4 billion in early 2024. But as of earlier this month, Anthropic had secured an $183 billion post-money valuation. Depending on the share structure, that means Ford Foundation’s stake, while tiny compared to key backers like Google and Amazon, has seen a huge increase in value over the last year. An Anthropic spokesperson said the Ford Foundation represents a small fraction of the firm’s overall investor base. Ford does not have any influence over Anthropic’s policy positions or business activities, the spokesperson added. “We are committed to protecting America’s lead in AI, defending and upholding America’s democratic values, and contesting the advance of authoritarian adversaries,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “As part of that commitment, Anthropic was an early mover in deploying AI for national security and intelligence work, and we work with the intelligence community in many different capacities.” The spokesperson also pushed back on the notion that Anthropic has a rift with the Trump administration. While Anthropic’s policies bar the use of its AI tools for “direct domestic surveillance and related collection of data,” multiple federal law enforcement agencies “are currently using Claude for research, analysis, and other use cases.” Other AI giants, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Google, have policies restricting use of their AI tools for surveillance purposes. A Ford Foundation spokesperson said: “Like any other passive investor in a company, the Ford Foundation has no role in Anthropic’s management or business activities.” Vance, who co-hosted an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” after the assassination, alleged that the Ford Foundation and the George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations had provided funding to progressive magazine The Nation. The vice president slammed the outlet for misrepresenting Kirk’s words in an article titled “Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning.” In response, Open Society said it never funded The Nation, while Ford Foundation said it hasn’t funded the outlet since 2019. The allegation was part of a larger pledge by Vance to target progressive groups that he accused of stoking a rise of left-wing violence. Advertisement

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Experiment is the only means of knowledge at our disposal. Everything else is poetry, imagination.”— Max Planck Number of the Week: Less than 10% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on the EPA Endangerment Finding by Richard Lindzen and William Happer. TWTW continues with a geological paper by Leszek Mark who asserts that the current warming is largely part of a natural cycle. Then TWTW discusses an assertion in the Wall Street Journal that human emissions of carbon dioxide have made the oceans too acidic to be considered healthy. ********************* EPA Endangerment Finding: On September 22, Richard Lindzen, Professor of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Emeritus, MIT, and William Happer, Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Princeton University, submitted their comments to Administrator Lee Zeldin of the US EPA on the reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. The highly accomplished forty-plus-page document is full of scientific evidence contradicting the Endangerment Finding. TWTW cannot adequately summarize it here but will cite some sections that may be of particular interest with the footnotes omitted. After thanking Administrator Zeldin for the opportunity to comment, the opening page states: We are career physicists with a special expertise in radiation physics, which describes how carbon dioxide and other GHGs affect heat flow in Earth’s atmosphere. We are both members of the National Academy of Sciences. Our CVs are attached. Our comment focuses on your request for comments as to, “The scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are weaker than previously believed and contradicted by empirical data, peer-reviewed studies, and scientific developments since 2009 (C-2).” In our scientific opinion, the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding (“EF”) are fatally flawed science, for two key reasons. • It fails to consider contradictory science. • It is not based on science; it is based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Scientific details follow.” After giving a table of contents, the Introduction states: “The EPA Endangerment Finding is: ‘[T]he Administrator finds that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare. Specifically, the Administrator is defining the ‘air pollution’ referred to in CAA section 202(a) to be the mix of six long-lived and directly-emitted greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).’ * * * ‘The Administrator has considered how elevated concentrations of the well-mixed greenhouse gases and associated climate change affect public health by evaluating the risks associated with changes in air quality, increases in temperatures, changes in extreme weather events, increases in food- and waterborne pathogens, and changes in aeroallergens.’ 74 FR 66,497. At the outset it is important to understand that carbon dioxide has two relevant properties, as a creator of food and oxygen, and as a greenhouse gas (GHG). As to food and oxygen, carbon dioxide is essential to nearly all life on earth by creating food and oxygen by photosynthesis. Further, it creates more food as its level in the atmosphere increases. For example, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature. As to carbon dioxide as a GHG, the Endangerment Finding is premised on the Net Zero Theory that carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions must be reduced to Net Zero and the use of fossil fuels must be eliminated by 2050 to avoid catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. A key premise the EPA has asserted is, ‘The increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere and the resulting warming have led to more frequent and more intense heat waves and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and retreating snow and ice.’ Further, a foundational premise of everything the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does is that the ‘evidence is clear that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change,’ where ‘main driver means responsible for more than 50% of the change.’ We demonstrate that the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding and of both the EPA and IPCC premises are fatally flawed science, for two key separate and combined reasons: First, both fail to consider contradictory science, including: Second, both are not based on science, and are based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and, furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Frankly, we also demonstrate that the Endangerment Finding is a classic example of what Peter Drucker described as government subordinating science to ‘value-judgments that are the reverse of, and largely incompatible with, any criteria one could possibly call scientific.’ Further, our opinion is that science requires urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march. Scientific details follow.” The comment then goes into a discussion of what is and what is not, science, which TWTW has presented in previous comments by Lindzen and Happer. Section III “The Endangerment Finding Failed to Consider Contradictory Science” begins with: The Endangerment Finding states: ‘The scientific evidence is compelling that elevated concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are the root cause of recently observed climate change. The IPCC conclusion from 2007 has been re-confirmed by the June 2009 USGCRP assessment that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.’ 74 FR 66,518 (footnote deleted). As a matter of physics, the scientific evidence cited by the Endangerment Finding from two government organizations, the IPCC and USGCRP, is false science. (Elaborated in section III.B and D).” [These sections are not presented in this TWTW.] “The five most abundant GHGs are water vapor (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and methane (CH4). Water vapor and clouds account “for more than 90% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.’ Thus, CO2 and all the other GHGs account for less than 10% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat and warm the planet. The Endangerment Finding cites six GHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 FR 66,516. The warming effects of methane and nitrous oxide are also so small that they are irrelevant to climate, as are the latter three. The physics of carbon dioxide and other GHGs is that they lose their capacity to warm the planet as their concentration in the atmosphere increases because of what is called “saturation,” and according to logarithmic equations. Every doubling of CO2 causes a warming of less than 1° C, to first approximation, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The other GHGs cause only a small fraction of the warming from CO2. Focusing on the physics of CO2, it becomes a less effective greenhouse gas at higher concentrations.” Then the comment gives a chart which may be confusing without more explanation and then continues with: “Most importantly, at today’s CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of approximately 425 parts per million and higher, saturation means that CO2 has little ability to absorb heat and warm the planet. Because of saturation, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). Saturation means that from now on, CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and other sources will have little impact on global warming. Since CO2 at today’s level is “saturated,” for this reason alone there is no risk that the continued use of fossil fuels will cause catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. Moreover, the mathematics of logarithms can also be applied to temperature increases since the beginning of the Industrial Age in 1750 when carbon dioxide levels were about 280 ppm. Doubling it to 560 ppm would also only cause a trivial increase in temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The increase in temperature would be even less, and trivial, if carbon dioxide increased from the beginning of the Industrial Age at 280 ppm to today’s 425 ppm, a much smaller increase of 145 ppm than doubling it to 560 ppm. Saturation also explains why temperatures were not catastrophically high over the hundreds of millions of years when CO2 levels were 10 to nearly 20 times higher than they are today, shown in the chart in Part III.C covering 600 million years.” [Part II C is not discussed in this TWTW.] “More specifically, the physics of how changes in atmospheric GHGs affect radiation transfer are described by precise physical equations that have never failed to describe observations. We and Prof. van Wijngaarden applied these formulas to the enormous efforts by the U. S. and worldwide to reduce CO2 emissions to Net Zero by 2050 in a paper that we recommend to those with a technical background.” The comment then discusses US going to net zero carbon dioxide emissions will have a miniscule effect on temperatures. It discusses the difference between the smooth Planck Curve of Earth’s blackbody radiation and the jagged curve of Earth’s radiation to space. The jagged curve identifies the frequencies associated with specific greenhouse gases. This section then concludes with: “Finally, note that CO2 is not nearly as potent a greenhouse gas as water vapor and clouds (especially cirrus clouds). A radiation-blocking effect of only about 3 W/m2 could easily also be produced by changes in the size or height of cloud cover on any given day. This is a complex system, and the idea that one variable, globally average temperature, is changed primarily by one thing, manmade CO2, is baseless. As one of us (Lindzen) has explained: ‘The climate system consists of two turbulent fluids interacting with each other, [ocean and atmosphere]. They are on a rotating planet that is differentially heated by the sun. A vital constituent of the atmospheric component is water in the liquid, solid, and vapor phases, and the changes in phase have vast energetic ramifications. The energy budget of this system involves the absorption and remission of about 200 watts per square meter. Doubling CO2 involves a two percent perturbation to this budget. So do minor changes in clouds, ocean circulations, and other features, and such changes are common. In this complex multifactor system, what is the likelihood that the climate (which itself consists of many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomalies) is controlled by a two percent perturbation in the energy budget due to just one of the numerous variables, namely CO2? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic.’ In conclusion, since CO2 at today’s level is ‘saturated,’ and the warming effects of the other GHGs are so small they are irrelevant to climate, physics demonstrates: Physics demonstrates there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding. For this reason alone, the Endangerment Finding should be repealed.” In the interests of brevity, this TWTW skips over a great deal of important scientific and other arguments to go to the last section citing an important Supreme Court decision and the Conclusion which state [Individual words in boldface were in italics in original]: “V. The Endangerment Finding Is Arbitrary, Capricious, and thus Invalided Under the Supreme Court’s State Farm Decision. As a legal matter, we understand State Farm is a key Supreme Court case that ruled that an agency regulation is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid where, inter alia: The Endangerment Finding fails each of these State Farm mandates: First, Unscientific Evidence. Unscientific evidence, misrepresented as science, is all the EPA provided underlying the Endangerment Finding, demonstrated in Part IV. Congress never intended for the EPA to consider and rely on unscientific evidence in making its Endangerment Finding, as it did. Second, Contradictory Scientific Evidence Ignored. The Endangerment Finding ignored and “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” the robust and reliable contradictory scientific evidence detailed above in Part III. Therefore, the Endangerment Finding is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid for either or both reasons under State Farm. CONCLUSION Accordingly, we demonstrated the Endangerment Finding is based on fatally flawed science, for two reasons: First, it fails to consider contradictory science, including:. Second, it is not based on science, it is based on unscientific sources. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Finally, we repeat, urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it is required because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march.” TWTW comment: It will be very interesting to see how the lower courts treat scientific argument, based on physical evidence, given the Supreme Court’s State Farm decision in 1983 “Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).

It states that the current warming is part of a natural cycle that has been going on throughout the Holocene (starting about 11,700 years ago). The present warm interglacial epoch in the Quaternary period (starting about 2.6 million years ago) features prolonged glacial periods (Ice Ages). The abstract of the paper states: “Cyclical climate change is characteristic of the Holocene, with successive warmings and coolings. A solar forcing mechanism has steered Holocene climate change, expressed by 9 cooling phases known as Bond events. There is reliable geological evidence that the temperatures of most warming phases in the Holocene were globally higher or similar to that of the current warming period, Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers in the northern hemisphere either disappeared or were smaller. During the African Humid Period in the Early and Middle Holocene, much stronger summer monsoons made the Sahara green with growth of savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The modern warming is part of a climatic cycle with a progressive warming after the Little Ice Age, the last cold episode of which occurred at the beginning of the 19th century. Successive climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are based on the assumption that the modern temperature rise is steered exclusively by the increasing content of human-induced CO2 in the atmosphere. If compared with the observational data, these projected temperatures have been highly overestimated.” As climate fluctuations, Bond events are similar to Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, except Bond events are noted in the current warm period (the Holocene), and DO events are noted in glacial periods. The UN IPCC and its colleagues largely ignore all climate history prior to about 1850 when the Earth came out of the Little Ice Age (one of the coldest periods, if not the coldest period, in the Holocene). They have abandoned the scientific method in favor of politics. The Mark paper concludes with: “The Holocene climate change was characterized by cyclical warmings (such as: Holocene Thermal Maximum, Late Bronze Age, Roman Warm Period, MWP) and coolings (Bond Events: including Iron Age Cold Period, Dark Ages Cold Period and LIA). The IPCC claims that current warming is unprecedented in the last 2000 or even the last 125,000 years; this statement is very unconvincing, and it is not supported by the geological data. There is good evidence that both in the last 2000 years as well during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were higher or broadly similar to the ones in the current warming period, the Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers (especially in the northern hemisphere) either disappeared or were smaller. Much stronger summer monsoons in the Early and Middle Holocene made the Sahara green with savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The terms ‘the Holocene Thermal Maximum’ and ‘the Holocene Climatic Optimum’ are avoided by the IPCC (2021), and its popularized statements making the current warming look ‘unprecedented’ and therefore ‘unique’ are false and flatten the climate history (cf. Marcott et al., 2013). The climate is a product of complicated interdependence of many factors that have not been yet sufficiently recognized qualitatively and quantitatively. It is a great scientific challenge that requires an extensive interdisciplinary research. There is a crucial need to make climate science less political and climate policy more scientific.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Acid Oceans? The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “The Ocean Is Now Too Acidic to Be Considered Healthy, Planetary Scientist Says.” Apparently, the reporter did not bother to double check for contrary evidence, particularly with those who understand chemistry. A 2015 paper by Roger Cohen and William Happer “Fundamentals of Ocean pH” begins with [Footnotes omitted here]: “We are often told that the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels will cause dangerous ocean acidification. Actually, the oceans will remain comfortably alkaline and hospitable to life for the foreseeable future. This brief note is a quantitative review of the physical chemistry of ocean pH. High school chemistry and algebra should provide enough background to follow the discussion. An excellent introduction to the chemistry of the oceans can be found in the book: Seawater: Its Composition, Properties and Behavior, by Wright and Colling. More details on ocean pH can be found in a recent review by Tans. 2 Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg (OH)2, and calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4(^-2), which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water.” The paper then goes into some mathematics and chemistry and shows that the oceans will remain alkaline with a pH slightly less than 8, even if rainwater (carbonic acid, H2CO3) becomes more acidic with an atmosphere with a carbon dioxide concentration of 1000 parts per million in volume, more than twice the current level of CO2. The paper concludes with [Figures not shown here]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed.

We see that the FAO is running the risk of finding itself on the wrong side of history if it unethically suppresses free scientific discourse.

It stated: “Arrhenius used the term carbolic acid, a mixture of water and carbon dioxide that exists in liquid form but does not exist as a gas in the atmosphere.” TWTW should have stated: “carbonic acid, a compound of water and carbon dioxide.” TWTW appreciates such corrections. ********************* Number of the Week: Less than 10% [H/t Lindzen and Happer] In his book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin writes: “Water vapor is the most important of the greenhouse gases. Of course, the amount in the atmosphere at any given place and time varies greatly (the humidity changes a lot with the weather). But on average, water vapor amounts to only about 0.4 percent of the molecules in the atmosphere. Even so, it accounts for more than 90 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat. John Tyndall, the Irish physicist who was the first to study the infrared properties of gases, eloquently expressed its importance in an 1863 public lecture: ‘Aqueous [water] vapor is a blanket, more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man. Remove for a single summer-night the aqueous vapor from the air which overspreads this country, and you would assuredly destroy every plant capable of being destroyed by a freezing temperature. The warmth of our fields and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space, and the sun would rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost.’ “The next most significant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), is different from water vapor in that its concentration in the atmosphere is much the same all over the globe. CO2 currently accounts for about 7 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.” [Boldface added] (pp 50, 51) [This estimate assumes cloudiness, not clear skies.] Censorship Human Rights Commission’s call to regulate debate around climate change under fire Sky News host Paul Murray has fired up over the Australian Human Rights Commission’s call for regulation to climate change debate.

We find that, at a stand level, trees have become larger over time, with mean tree basal area increasing by 3.3% per decade (95% CI 2.4; 4.1). Larger trees have increased in both number and size, yet we observed similar rates of relative size gain in large and small trees. This evidence is consistent with a resource-driven boost for larger trees but also a reduction in suppression among smaller trees. These results, especially the persistence and consistency of tree size increases across Amazonian forest plots, communities and regions, indicate that any negative impacts of climate change on forests and large trees here have so far been mitigated by the positive effects of increased resources.

Hurricane Helene expanded rapidly before making landfall, ballooning into one of the largest storms in U.S. history at an estimated width of over 400 miles and causing unprecedented damage.

What was supposed to be a two-year suspension became permanent, although a small cod fishery was reopened in 2024. This being the 1990s, no one thought to blame climate change for the disappearance of the fish, instead pointing to the massive fishing fleets that had been emptying the oceans of everything that moved for decades. But never ones to pass up a chance, a group of climate scientists published a paper in 2003 based on, of course, climate models not real-world data, and it warned that ocean warming would speed up the decline of North Sea cod which were already almost all gone. Unfortunately for them, though maybe fortunately for the fish, the #HaveItBothWays rule soon kicked into gear. Latest Science Further Exposes Lies About Rising Seas By Vijay Jayaraj, WUWT, Sep 22, 2025 Changing Cryosphere – Land / Sea Ice Arctic Sea Ice Refuses To Disappear (Again!) By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 For sheer persistence in getting it wrong, however, the prize must go to Professor Peter Wadhams, Professor of Ocean Physics, and Head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge: Arctic Sea Ice Minimum 2025: Another Year, Another Non-Event By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 Solar cycles, ocean oscillations (such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and shifting wind patterns all play into the distribution and persistence of Arctic ice. Pretending this is purely about CO₂ levels is simplistic at best and misleading at worst. As NSIDC itself admits, the flattening trend is still a subject of “active debate” among scientists. Perhaps it’s time for policymakers and journalists to debate it as well — instead of pretending the science is “settled.” So, about that rebounding ice By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 As we’ve mentioned, there are several ways to draw a trend line through complicated data including the one for Arctic ice. But they are not all equally valid. Even statistics involves some art as well as science. But it should not include hocus-pocus. In this regard we continue to insist, in the face of alarmists saying it’s long-term trends that matter, that it is in fact long-term trends that matter. And we also continue to insist, in this regard, that it is the dreaded cherry-picking to lean too hard on the fact that the modern satellite record coincides with a cyclical peak in Arctic ice around 1979 that cannot rationally be ascribed to human influence, since there is no plausible argument that we were cooling the planet from the 1940s through the 1970s, though at the time it was blamed on, yes, our burning fossil fuels by people who seem to start with the verdict that our civilization is evil, rapacious and self-destructive and work backwards to an indictment that fits the short-run evidence. Changing Earth Earth’s natural CO2 vacuum cleaners By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 20, 2025 Link to paper: Earth’s silicate weathering continuum By Gerrit Trapp-Müller, et al., Nature Geoscience, Aug 7, 2025 From the abstract: Chemical weathering of silicate rocks redistributes major, minor and trace elements through coupled dissolution–precipitation reactions. These weathering processes drive shifts in ocean acid–base chemistry, modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and providing a stabilizing feedback in the carbon cycle. Silicate weathering occurs in both terrestrial and marine environments, releasing (‘forward’) or consuming alkalinity (‘reverse’), but these have largely been perceived as independent and studied in isolation. Earthquake jolts San Francisco Bay Area By Ryan Mense and Alex Baker, The Hill, Sep 22, 2025 Initially, the USGS deemed the quake a 4.6 before revising it down to 4.3. Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine World Cereal Output Set For all-Time High By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Apparently the UN IPCC ignores the reports of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.] Lowering Standards National Academies go preposterous on CO2 By David Wojick, CFACT, Sep 23, 2025 You would think the National Academy of Sciences understands science, but you would be wrong. Their president just approved a report whose conclusion is scientifically impossible! The report is jointly from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). Titled “Effects of Human-Caused Greenhouse Gas Emissions on U.S. Climate, Health, and Welfare,” this squirrelly tome is a formal comment on EPA’s proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding. Clearly NASEM is no longer fit for purpose. Ideally, Congress should revoke its charter. At the least the President should issue an executive order instructing the federal agencies not to use NASEM. It has long been standard practice for agencies launching new programs to run them by NASEM for approval. This practice should stop. STEVE MILLOY: Rigged Report By National Academies Aims To Thwart Trump Energy Agenda By Steve Milloy, Daily Caller, Sep 21, 2025 There is not enough room in this column for a comprehensive critique of the NAS report, but here is just one other egregious example. Citing an EPA graph, the report asserts that heat waves have increased since the 1960s. But the report studiously avoids another more complete EPA graph showing that heatwaves have dramatically decreased since the 1930s. The Rocky Mountain Institute’s Climate & DEI Colonialism in Africa By Ken Braun, Real Clear Energy, Sep 23, 2025 According to Our World in Data, there are 677.4 million people living without “an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.” Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, and 156 million of these desperate souls—23% of the world total—reside in those three nations set to receive RMI’s “women energy practitioners.” But rather than bringing genuine and desperately needed energy to Africa, the Rocky Mountain Institute and its deeply deluded donors are offering unreliable renewables delivered by a women-only DEI initiative. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? Beware How the Climate Crusade ‘Partners’ With the Media and ‘Educates’ the Courts By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Sep 24, 2025 The Climate Crisis Anti Baby Movement By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The Aussie ABC thinks Zoomers are staging a baby strike until their elders fix the climate crisis. Claim: Aussie Climate Refugees are Moving to Tasmania By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 24, 2025 So, despite the ABC’s attempt to make it look like climate change is driving a demographic shift to colder states, this is no more happening in Australia than it is in the USA. Warm lifestyle states like Queensland and Florida both enjoy strong population growth and will continue to be a favorite destination for the foreseeable future. False, New York Times, Climate Change Isn’t Causing More European Heat Deaths By Anthony Watts, Climate Realism, Sep 19, 2025 You Can’t Get the Extinguisher without Breaking Glass By Geoff Chambers, Climate Scepticism, Sep 24, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Communicating Better to the Public – Exaggerate, or be Vague? Recent Dust Storm Panic Is Just More Hot Air From Climate Alarmists By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 Communicating Better to the Public – Go Personal. Al Gore: Trump’s ‘Jihad Against Sustainability Transition’ Creates U.S. ‘Distortion Field’ By Jasmyn Jordan, Breitbart, Sep 18, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Corals Won’t Disappear, Contrary to What the New York Times Claims By Anthony Watts, Climate Realism, Sep 23, 2025 The Media’s Psyop Against Skeptical Climate Scientists By Vijay Jayara, WUWT, Sep 22, 2025 Predicting catastrophe is a media business model. NPR warned of “irreversible” sea-level rise in 2023, ignoring tide gauge records that show no acceleration beyond historical norms. News outlets regularly report on “unprecedented” floods, yet data indicate no uptick in floods due to climate change. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda on Children Waves of conformism By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Speaking of long-term trends and data, the cool kids or at this point the hot kids are all independently stampeding to attribution science, a form of hocus-pocus that bypasses evidence to get the verdict in question. For instance “Recent Canadian heat waves made much more likely by human-caused climate change” from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Which you might think means they have data proving they are happening more often. Pfft. This is attribution science, where all you only need models, not data. Communicating Better to the Public – Protest A picturesque Yorkshire village is battling an ugly net-zero facility By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 21, 2025 Questioning European Green The greenlash is here: Britain cannot afford Net Zero and democracy at the same time By Maurice Cousins, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 Link to report: Britons’ attitudes to high energy bills: the permacrisis that keeps burning By Chris Annous & Archie Herrick, More in Common, September 2025, Funded by Octopus Energy, UK energy supplier. Click to access britain-s-high-energy-bills_-the-permacrisis-that-keeps-on-burning-6.pdf The survey and focus groups referenced in this report and the writing of this report has been funded by Octopus Energy. More in Common has maintained, as is the case for all of our partnership work, full editorial independence when conducting this research and writing this report. The views expressed within this report are therefore the views of More in Common. From Cousins: Contrary to what critics claim, opposition to renewables is not an anti-climate science or ideological position. Green energy is capital-intensive, infrastructure-heavy, and drives extraordinary system inefficiency. Even if turbines and panels fall in price, the total bill to consumers will remain higher than the legacy model of baseload generation. Britain’s industrial disaster By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Questioning Green Elsewhere Admitting the obvious By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 We also like advocates of wind and solar thinking and talking about the physics and engineering of grid stability. If they really can make it work, if they can overcome problems of scale and distribution and battery technology leaps forward and so on, we could be persuaded that wind and solar have a bright future. But we really do need to see the practicalities acknowledged and analyzed. Including the very basic point that, when you get down to such things, it’s complicated, especially given the ways in which subsidies distort the picture. And that one thing that’s certainly complicated, for them anyway, is that the “green energy transition” at least coincided with, if it did not cause, a vast surge in the cost of power. Funding Issues Energy Department plans to claw back $13B in green funds By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Sep 24, 2025 Why Are Green Activists Suddenly Outraged at the Billions Wasted Paying Wind Farms to Switch Off When it’s Too Windy? By Ben Pile, The Daily Sceptic, Sep 23, 2025 The Political Games Continue Jenrick backs overhaul of UK CfDs Press Release, Net Zero Watch, Sep 25, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Jenrick is a Shadow Justice Secretary and former Cabinet minister.] Litigation Issues Climate Lawsuits in Montana By Edwin X Berry, Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, His Blog, Sep 20, 2025 [H/t Ron Clutz] The fundamental science issue in all climate lawsuits is whether these unstated hypotheses are true or false: (1) Human CO2 causes all the CO2 increase above 280 ppm. (2) This CO2 increase causes global warming. (3) This global warming causes the plaintiffs claimed damages. Judicial Limits on Glyphosate and Climate ‘Jackpot Justice’ Litigation Narrowly defined decision provides guidance on ‘evidence’ for alleged cause of harm By Paul Driessen, WUWT, Sep 23, 2025 Although the US Supreme Court frequently overrules it, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (covering California, eight other western states and two US territories) deserves applause for its recent Engilis v. Monsanto decision. The Fallacy of ‘Exxon Knew” (Part II) By Robert Bradley Jr. Master Resource, Sep 24, 2025 Part I, Sep 23, 2025 Bradley: This memo from certain employees never made it to a company position for cause. Global cooling was the bigger concern back then, and the above memo did not investigate the SO2 offset, much less the benefits from CO2 fertilization and incremental warming. Peak Oil and Peak Gas was the intellectual/practical concern of this era. [SEPP Comment: The memo is dated October 16, 1979. The administration of President Carter (1977 to 1981) and Congress passed laws advocating the use of coal to replace oil and natural gas, which, based on faulty models, Washington feared would soon be exhausted.] Subsidies and Mandates Forever Congressional testimony reveals the hidden causes behind America’s looming $38 billion energy rate hikes: ‘If things keep going like this, [bills] are gonna be higher next year’ “The U.S. is falling far behind global competitors.” By Kristen Lawrence, The Cool Down, Sep 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] On top of all these reasons for soaring energy rates, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is making electricity more expensive by phasing out tax credits for clean energy, such as solar and wind power, resulting in slower construction of renewable projects and restricting the supply of affordable power. [SEPP Comment: If wind and solar are low cost, why are subsidies needed?] Offshore windfarm receives £2bn subsidies in just six years Press release, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 As a result, Hornsea 1 is currently receiving a guaranteed £200 per megawatt hour for its power, nearly three times current market prices. Energy Issues – Non-US New LCCC Dashboards By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 23, 2025 They cover CfDs [Contracts for Difference] and Capacity Market stuff amongst other things. I’ll have a play around, but it seems they avoid an awful lot of legwork and analysis which I have been doing on spreadsheets. I’ve shown below a typical CfD graph, which shows subsidy costs by quarter, and the quarterly market price. I would recommend using it to convince doubters, as it is the official source. London Array Subsidies Hit £300 Million Last Year By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 At current prices, London Array has been paid £3.6 billion in subsidies since it opened in 2013. And all for just 2 TWh a year, less than 1% of the electricity supplied in the UK. Energy Issues – Australia CCA: Artificial Intelligence is a Challenge to Climate Goals By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 23, 2025 Link to: 2035 Targets Advice By the Climate Change Authority, Commonwealth of Australia, 2025 Click to access 2035%20Targets%20Advice.pdf Senate inquiry into climate and energy seeks truth, allegedly An attempt by the Greens to silence climate change dissent By Alan Moran, Spectator.com AU, Sep 12, 2025 It is my belief that the target is to identify presumptive funding for and to prevent the dissemination of information that is contrary to the belief of dangerous human-induced climate change. It is directed at those who dispute claims that the ‘science is settled’ and that harmful global outcomes will ensue unless urgent action is taken. The aim is to combat and suppress contrary views.

This is like smashing your car with a baseball bat, then screaming at the mechanic when it won’t start. Oil and Natural Gas – the Future or the Past?

Batteries cannot supply any power, as power is generated somewhere else first. That electricity still has to be paid for in addition to the costs of the battery storage. The “BESS” DELUSION: Why battery storage is a FANTASY By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 22, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Video about Eastern Australia going wind and solar – 12 million MWh of battery storage needed? At what cost?] Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Porsche delays new electric car after demand slump By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Carbon Schemes Pouring Money Down The CO2 Drain By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 The Government has just announced two more carbon capture projects: It goes without saying that spending taxpayer money on non-jobs, that create no added value for the economy, will act as a brake on economic growth in the long run. I cannot think of anything more stupid than to dig a big hole and bury money in it! California Dreaming California’s Latest Climate Theater: Newsom Signs Another Expensive Illusion By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The core of the package is an extension of the cap-and-trade program—rebranded “cap-and-invest”—all the way to 2045. That rebranding glosses over that the structure is largely the same: companies must either reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, buy emission allowances, or invest in offsets. The revenues from auctioning allowances are then redistributed (some), invested (many), or spent (often). In recent years, those auctions have raised between $3 billion and $4.3 billion annually. These revenues fund programs ranging from wildfire prevention to transportation, housing, and utility credits. California Dems Scramble To Boost Oil Production After Running Refiners Out Of Town By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Sep 19, 2025 “After years of pushing radical climate policies that punished working families, Governor Newsom is finally waking up to what Californians need, he’s now scrambling to secure the very fossil fuels he tried to eliminate,” CEO of the American Energy Institute Jason Isaac told the Daily Caller News Foundation previously. “This sudden embrace of petroleum isn’t leadership, it’s survival. California’s energy future depends on realism, not green delusions.” The Cost and the Upside of the “Big Gulp” By Edward Ring, What’s Current, Accessed Sep 25, 2025 Link to study: A New Approach to Accounting for Environmental Water: Insights from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta By Greg Gartrell, Public Policy Institute of California, November 2017 Click to access r_1117ggr.pdf Other Scientific News NASA, NOAA Launch Three Spacecraft to Map Sun’s Influence Across Space By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 25, 2025 Over the next few months, the spacecraft will make their way to their destination — a location between Earth and the Sun, about a million miles from Earth, called Lagrange point 1 (L1). They should arrive by January and, once their instrument checkouts and calibrations are complete, begin their missions to better understand space weather and protect humanity. Forest Composition and Fire History In Light of New Evidence By Don Healy, WUWT, Sep 25, 2025 Link to paper: The North American tree-ring fire-scar network By Ellis Q. Margolis, et al., Ecosphere, 2022 From the abstract: The historical influence of Indigenous and non-Indigenous human land use on fire regimes varies in space and time. A 20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). From Healy: Implications for Fire Management – The paper likely argues for integrating Indigenous fire stewardship into contemporary land management—not just as a cultural restoration, but as an ecological necessity. – It challenges dominant narratives that treat fire as inherently destructive, instead reframing it as a regenerative force when guided by traditional ecological knowledge.

Public health departments warn against lone star ticks and AGS, and scientists are working to develop an inoculation to AGS. Herein, we argue that if eating meat is morally impermissible, then efforts to prevent the spread of tickborne AGS are also morally impermissible. Quit Promoting Mad Schemes, New York Times, Blocking the Sun is a Dangerous Climate Gamble By Anthony Watts, Climate Realism, Sep 25, 2025 In The New York Times’ (NYT) op-ed, “Turns Out Air Pollution Was Good for Something,” Zeke Hausfather and David Keith argue that because sulfur particles from past industrial pollution once cooled the planet by reflecting sunlight, policymakers should now consider a deliberate version of that process. They suggest aircraft could inject sulfur into the upper atmosphere to mimic the cooling once provided by dirty smokestacks, pointing to volcanic eruptions such as Mount Pinatubo in 1991 as evidence the method would work.

Title: The Case Against Generative AI
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/
Time Published: 2025-09-29T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Soundtrack: Queens of the Stone Age - First It Giveth Before we go any further: This is, for the third time this year, the longest newsletter I've ever written, weighing in somewhere around 18,500 words. I've written it specifically to be read at your leisure — dip in and out where you'd like — but also in one go. This is my comprehensive case that yes, we’re in a bubble, one that will inevitably (and violently) collapse in the near future. I'll also be cutting this into a four-part episode starting tomorrow on my podcast Better Offline. I deeply appreciate your time. If you like this newsletter, please think about subscribing to the premium, which I write weekly. Thanks for reading. Alright, let’s do this one last time. In 2022, a (kind-of) company called OpenAI surprised the world with a website called ChatGPT that could generate text that sort-of sounded like a person using a technology called Large Language Models (LLMs), which can also be used to generate images, video and computer code. Large Language Models require entire clusters of servers connected with high-speed networking, all containing this thing called a GPU — graphics processing units. These are different to the GPUs in your Xbox, or laptop, or gaming PC. They cost much, much more, and they’re good at doing the processes of inference (the creation of the output of any LLM) and training (feeding masses of training data to models, or feeding them information about what a good output might look like, so they can later identify a thing or replicate it). These models showed some immediate promise in their ability to articulate concepts or generate video, visuals, audio, text and code. They also immediately had one glaring, obvious problem: because they’re probabilistic, these models can’t actually be relied upon to do the same thing every single time. So, if you generated a picture of a person that you wanted to, for example, use in a story book, every time you created a new page, using the same prompt to describe the protagonist, that person would look different — and that difference could be minor (something that a reader should shrug off), or it could make that character look like a completely different person. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of generative AI meant that whenever you asked it a question, it would guess as to the answer, not because it knew the answer, but rather because it was guessing on the right word to add in a sentence based on previous training data. As a result, these models would frequently make mistakes — something which we later referred to as “hallucinations.” And that’s not even mentioning the cost of training these models, the cost of running them, the vast amounts of computational power they required, the fact that the legality of using material scraped from books and the web without the owner’s permission was (and remains) legally dubious, or the fact that nobody seemed to know how to use these models to actually create profitable businesses. These problems were overshadowed by something flashy, and new, and something that investors — and the tech media — believed would eventually automate the single thing that’s proven most resistant to automation: namely, knowledge work and the creative economy. This newness and hype and these expectations sent the market into a frenzy, with every hyperscaler immediately creating the most aggressive market for one supplier I’ve ever seen. NVIDIA has sold over $200 billion of GPUs since the beginning of 2023, becoming the largest company on the stock market and trading at over $170 as of writing this sentence only a few years after being worth $19.52 a share. While I’ve talked about some of the propelling factors behind the AI wave — automation and novelty — that’s not a complete picture. A huge reason why everybody decided to “do AI” was because the software industry’s growth was slowing, with SaaS (Software As A Service) company valuations stalling or dropping, resulting in the terrifying prospect of companies having to “under promise and over deliver” and “be efficient.” Things that normal companies — those whose valuations aren’t contingent on ever-increasing, ever-constant growth — don’t have to worry about, because they’re normal companies. Suddenly, there was the promise of a new technology — Large Language Models — that were getting exponentially more powerful, which was mostly a lie but hard to disprove because “powerful” can mean basically anything, and the definition of “powerful” depended entirely on whoever you asked at any given time, and what that person’s motivations were. The media also immediately started tripping on its own feet, mistakenly claiming OpenAI’s GPT-4 model tricked a Taskrabbit into solving a CAPTCHA (it didn’t — this never happened), or saying that “people who don’t know how to code already [used] bots to produce full-fledged games,” and if you’re wondering what “full-fledged” means, it means “pong” and a cobbled-together rolling demo of SkyRoads, a game from 1993. The media (and investors) helped peddle the narrative that AI was always getting better, could do basically anything, and that any problems you saw today would be inevitably solved in a few short months, or years, or, well, at some point I guess. LLMs were touted as a digital panacea, and the companies building them offered traditional software companies the chance to plug these models into their software using an API, thus allowing them to ride the same generative AI wave that every other company was riding. The model companies similarly started going after individual and business customers, offering software and subscriptions that promised the world, though this mostly boiled down to chatbots that could generate stuff, and then doubled down with the promise of “agents” — a marketing term that’s meant to make you think “autonomous digital worker” but really means “broken digital product.” Throughout this era, investors and the media spoke with a sense of inevitability that they never really backed up with data. It was an era based on confidently-asserted “vibes.” Everything was always getting better and more powerful, even though there was never much proof that this was truly disruptive technology, other than in its ability to disrupt apps you were using with AI — making them worse by, for example, suggesting questions on every Facebook post that you could ask Meta AI, but which Meta AI couldn’t answer. “AI” was omnipresent, and it eventually grew to mean everything and nothing. OpenAI would see its every move lorded over like a gifted child, its CEO Sam Altman called the “Oppenheimer of Our Age,” even if it wasn’t really obvious why everyone was impressed. GPT-4 felt like something a bit different, but was it actually meaningful? The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is built and sold on not just faith, but a series of myths that the AI boosters expect us to believe with the same certainty that we treat things like gravity, or the boiling point of water. Can large language models actually replace coders? Not really, no, and I’ll get into why later in the piece. Can Sora — OpenAI’s video creation tool — replace actors or animators? No, not at all, but it still fills the air full of tension because you can immediately see who is pre-registered to replace everyone that works for them. AI is apparently replacing workers, but nobody appears to be able to prove it! But every few weeks a story runs where everybody tries to pretend that AI is replacing workers with some poorly-sourced and incomprehensible study, never actually saying “someone’s job got replaced by AI” because it isn’t happening at scale, and because if you provide real-world examples, people can actually check. To be clear, some people have lost jobs to AI, just not the white collar workers, software engineers, or really any of the career paths that the mainstream media and AI investors would have you believe. Brian Merchant has done excellent work covering how LLMs have devoured the work of translators, using cheap, “almost good” automation to lower already-stagnant wages in a field that was already hurting before the advent of generative AI, with some having to abandon the field, and others pushed into bankruptcy. I’ve heard the same for art directors, SEO experts, and copy editors, and Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal covered these last year. These are all fields with something in common: shitty bosses with little regard for their customers who have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to slash contract labor. To quote Merchant, “the drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of ‘powerful AI’ encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have.” Across the board, the people being “replaced” by AI are the victims of lazy, incompetent cost-cutters who don’t care if they ship poorly-translated text. To quote Merchant again, “[AI hype] has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting “good enough” automation output for video games and media products.” Yet the jobs crisis facing translators speaks to the larger flaws of the Large Language Model era, and why other careers aren’t seeing this kind of disruption. Generative AI creates outputs, and by extension defines all labor as some kind of output created from a request. In the case of translation, it’s possible for a company to get by with a shitty version, because many customers see translation as “what do these words say,” even though (as one worker told Merchant) translation is about conveying meaning. Nevertheless, “translation” work had already started to condense to a world where humans would at times clean up machine-generated text, and the same worker warned that the same might come for other industries. Yet the problem is that translation is a heavily output-driven industry, one where (idiot) bosses can say “oh yeah that’s fine” because they ran an output back through Google Translate and it seemed fine in their native tongue. The problems of a poor translation are obvious, but the customers of translation are, it seems, often capable of getting by with a shitty product. The problem is that most jobs are not output-driven at all, and what we’re buying from a human being is a person’s ability to think. Every CEO talking about AI replacing workers is an example of the real problem: that most companies are run by people who don’t understand or experience the problems they’re solving, don’t do any real work, don’t face any real problems, and thus can never be trusted to solve them. The Era of the Business Idiot is the result of letting management consultants and neoliberal “free market” sociopaths take over everything, leaving us with companies run by people who don’t know how the companies make money, just that they must always make more. When you’re a big, stupid asshole, every job that you see is condensed to its outputs, and not the stuff that leads up to the output, or the small nuances and conscious decisions that make an output good as opposed to simply acceptable, or even bad. What does a software engineer do? They write code! What does a writer do? They write words! What does a hairdresser do? They cut hair! Yet that’s not actually the case. As I’ll get into later, a software engineer does far more than just code, and when they write code they’re not just saying “what would solve this problem?” with a big smile on their face — they’re taking into account their years of experience, what code does, what code could do, all the things that might break as a result, and all of the things that you can’t really tell from just looking at code, like whether there’s a reason things are made in a particular way. A good coder doesn’t just hammer at the keyboard with the aim of doing a particular task. They factor in questions like: How does this functionality fit into the code that’s already here? Or, if someone has to update this code in the future, how do I make it easy for them to understand what I’ve written and to make changes without breaking a bunch of other stuff? A writer doesn’t just “write words.” They jostle ideas and ideals and emotions and thoughts and facts and feelings into a condensed piece of text, explaining both what’s happening and why it’s happening from their perspective, finding nuanced ways to convey large topics, none of which is the result of a single (or many) prompts but the ever-shifting sand of a writer’s brain. Good writing is a fight between a bunch of different factors: structure, style, intent, audience, and prioritizing the things that you (or your client) care about in the text. It’s often emotive — or at the very least, driven or inspired by a given emotion — which is something that an AI simply can’t replicate in a way that’s authentic and believable. And a hairdresser doesn’t just cut hair, but cuts your hair, which may be wiry, dry, oily, long, short, healthy, unhealthy, on a scalp with particular issues, at a time of year when perhaps you want to change length, at a time that fits you, in “the way you like” which may be impossible to actually write down but they get it just right. And they make conversation, making you feel at ease while they snip and clip away at your tresses, with you having to trust that they’ll get it right. This is the true nature of labor that executives fail to comprehend at scale: that the things we do are not units of work, but extrapolations of experience, emotion, and context that cannot be condensed in written meaning. Business Idiots see our labor as the result of a smart manager saying “do this,” rather than human ingenuity interpreting both a request and the shit the manager didn’t say. What does a CEO do? Uhhh, um, well, a Harvard study says they spend 25% of their time on “people and relationships,” 25% on “functional and business unit reviews,” 16% on “organization and culture,” and 21% on “strategy,” with a few percent here and there for things like “professional development.” That’s who runs the vast majority of companies: people that describe their work predominantly as “looking at stuff,” “talking to people” and “thinking about what we do next.” The most highly-paid jobs in the world are impossible to describe, their labor described in a mish-mash of LinkedInspiraton, yet everybody else’s labor is an output that can be automated. As a result, Large Language Models seem like magic. When you see everything as an outcome — an outcome you may or may not understand, and definitely don’t understand the process behind, let alone care about — you kind of already see your workers as LLMs. You create a stratification of the workforce that goes beyond the normal organizational chart, with senior executives — those closer to the class level of CEO — acting as those who have risen above the doldrums of doing things to the level of “decisionmaking,” a fuzzy term that can mean everything from “making nuanced decisions with input from multiple different subject-matter experts” to, as ServiceNow Bill McDermott did in 2022, “[make] it clear to everybody [in a boardroom of other executives], everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.” The same extends to some members of the business and tech media that have, for the most part, gotten by without having to think too hard about the actual things the companies are saying. I realize this sounds a little mean, and I must be clear it doesn’t mean that these people know nothing, just that it’s been possible to scoot through the world without thinking too hard about whether or not something is true. When Salesforce said back in 2024 that its “Einstein Trust Layer” and AI would be “transformational for jobs,” the media dutifully wrote it down and published it without a second thought. It fully trusted Marc Benioff when he said that Agentforce agents would replace human workers, and then again when he said that AI agents are doing “30% to 50% of all the work in Salesforce itself,” even though that’s an unproven and nakedly ridiculous statement. Salesforce’s CFO said earlier this year that AI wouldn’t boost sales growth in 2025. One would think this would change how they’re covered, or how seriously one takes Marc Benioff. It hasn’t, because nobody is paying attention. In fact, nobody seems to be doing their job. This is how the core myths of generative AI were built: by executives saying stuff and the media publishing it without thinking too hard. AI is replacing workers! AI is writing entire computer programs! AI is getting exponentially more-powerful! What does “powerful” mean? That the models are getting better on benchmarks that are rigged in their favor, but because nobody fucking explains it, regular people are regularly told that AI is “powerful.” The only thing “powerful” about generative AI is its mythology. The world’s executives, entirely disconnected from labor and actual production, are doing the only thing they know how to — spend a bunch of money and say vague stuff about “AI being the future.” There are people — journalists, investors, and analysts — that have built entire careers on filling in the gaps for the powerful as they splurge billions of dollars and repeat with increasing desperation that “the future is here” as absolutely nothing happens. You’ve likely seen a few ridiculous headlines recently. One of the most recent, and most absurd, is that that OpenAI will pay Oracle $300 billion over four years, closely followed with the claim that NVIDIA will “invest” “$100 billion” in OpenAI to build 10GW of AI data centers, though the deal is structured in a way that means that OpenAI is paid “progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” and OpenAI will be leasing the chips (rather than buying them outright). I must be clear that these deals are intentionally made to continue the myth of generative AI, to pump NVIDIA, and to make sure OpenAI insiders can sell $10.3 billion of shares. OpenAI cannot afford the $300 billion, NVIDIA hasn’t sent OpenAI a cent and won’t do so if it can’t build the data centers, which OpenAI most assuredly can’t afford to do. NVIDIA needs this myth to continue, because in truth, all of these data centers are being built for demand that doesn’t exist, or that — if it exists — doesn’t necessarily translate into business customers paying huge amounts for access to OpenAI’s generative AI services. NVIDIA, OpenAI, CoreWeave and other AI-related companies hope that by announcing theoretical billions of dollars (or hundreds of billions of dollars) of these strange, vague and impossible-seeming deals, they can keep pretending that demand is there, because why else would they build all of these data centers, right? That, and the entire stock market rests on NVIDIA’s back. It accounts for 7% to 8% of the value of the S&P 500, and Jensen Huang needs to keep selling GPUs. I intend to explain later on how all of this works, and how brittle it really is. The intention of these deals is simple: to make you think “this much money can’t be wrong.” It can. These people need you to believe this is inevitable, but they are being proven wrong, again and again, and today I’m going to continue doing so. Underpinning these stories about huge amounts of money and endless opportunity lies a dark secret — that none of this is working, and all of this money has been invested in a technology that doesn’t make much revenue and loves to burn millions or billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. Over half a trillion dollars has gone into an entire industry without a single profitable company developing models or products built on top of models. By my estimates, there is around $44 billion of revenue in generative AI this year (when you add in Anthropic and OpenAI’s revenues to the pot, along with the other stragglers) and most of that number has been gathered through reporting from outlets like The Information, because none of these companies share their revenues, all of them lose shit tons of money, and their actual revenues are really, really small. Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue — Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported “$13 billion in annualized revenue,” so around $1.083 billion a month. Microsoft is a sales MACHINE. It is built specifically to create or exploit software markets, suffocating competitors by using its scale to drive down prices, and to leverage the ecosystem that it’s created over the past few decades. $1 billion a month in revenue is chump change for an organization that makes over $27 billion a quarter in PROFITS. Don’t worry Satya, I’ll come back to you later. “But Ed, the early days!” Worry not — I’ve got that covered. This is nothing like any other era of tech. There has never been this kind of cash-rush, even in the fiber boom. Over a decade, Amazon spent about one-tenth of the capex that the Magnificent Seven spent in two years on generative AI building AWS — something that now powers a vast chunk of the web, and has long been Amazon’s most profitable business unit. Generative AI is nothing like Uber, with OpenAI and Anthropic’s true costs coming in at about $159 billion in the past two years, approaching five times Uber’s $30 billion all-time burn. And that’s before the bullshit with NVIDIA and Oracle. Microsoft last reported AI revenue in January. It’s October this week. Why did it stop reporting this number, you think? Is it because the numbers are so good it couldn’t possibly let people know? As a general rule, publicly traded companies — especially those where the leadership are compensated primarily in equity — tend to brag about their successes, in part because said bragging boosts the value of the thing that the leadership gets paid in. There’s no benefit to being shy. Oracle literally made a regulatory filing to boast it had a $30 billion customer, which turned out to be OpenAI, who eventually agreed (publicly) to spend $300 billion in compute over five years. Which is to say that Microsoft clearly doesn’t have any good news to share, and as I’ll reveal later, they can’t even get 3% of their 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot. If Microsoft can’t sell this shit, nobody can. Anyway, I’m nearly done, sorry, you see, I’m writing this whole thing as if you’re brand new and walking up to this relatively unprepared, so I need to introduce another company. In 2020, a splinter group jumped off of OpenAI, funded by Amazon and Google to do much the same thing as OpenAI but pretend to be nicer about it until they have to raise from the Middle East. Anthropic has always been better at coding for some reason, and people really like its Claude models. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have become the only two companies in generative AI to make any real progress, either in terms of recognition or in sheer commercial terms, accounting for the majority of the revenue in the AI industry. In a very real sense, the AI industry’s revenue is OpenAI and Anthropic. In the year where Microsoft recorded $13bn in AI revenues, $10 billion came from OpenAI’s spending on Microsoft Azure. Anthropic burned $5.3 billion last year — with the vast majority of that going towards compute. Outside of these two companies, there’s barely enough revenue to justify a single data center. Where we sit today is a time of immense tension. Mark Zuckerberg says we’re in a bubble, Sam Altman says we’re in a bubble, Alibaba Chairman and billionaire Joe Tsai says we’re in a bubble, Apollo says we’re in a bubble, nobody is making money and nobody knows why they’re actually doing this anymore, just that they must do it immediately. And they have yet to make the case that generative AI warranted any of these expenditures. That was undoubtedly the longest introduction to a newsletter I’ve ever written, and the reason why I took my time was because this post demands a level of foreshadowing and exposition, and because I want to make it make sense to anyone who reads it — whether they’ve read my newsletter for years, or whether they’re only just now investigating their suspicions that generative AI may not be all it’s cracked up to be. Today I will make the case that generative AI’s fundamental growth story is flawed, and explain why we’re in the midst of an egregious bubble. This industry is sold by keeping things vague, and knowing that most people don’t dig much deeper than a headline, a problem I simply do not have. This industry is effectively in service of two companies — OpenAI and NVIDIA — who pump headlines out through endless contracts between them and subsidiaries or investments to give the illusion of activity. OpenAI is now, at this point, on the hook for over a trillion dollars, an egregious sum for a company that already forecast billions in losses, with no clear explanation as to how it’ll afford any of this beyond “we need more money” and the vague hope that there’s another Softbank or Microsoft waiting in the wings to swoop in and save the day. I’m going to walk you through where I see this industry today, and why I see no future for it beyond a fiery apocalypse. While everybody (reasonably!) harps on about hallucinations — which, to remind you, is when a model authoritatively states something that isn’t true — but the truth is far more complex, and far worse than it seems. You cannot rely on a large language model to do what you want. Even the most highly-tuned models on the most expensive and intricate platform can’t actually be relied upon to do exactly what you want. A “hallucination” isn’t just when these models say something that isn’t true. It’s when they decide to do something wrong because it seems the most likely thing to do, or when a coding model decides to go on a wild goose chase, failing the user and burning a ton of money in the process. The advent of “reasoning” models — those engineered to ‘think’ through problems in a way reminiscent of a human — and the expansion of what people are (trying) to use LLMs for demands that the definition of an AI hallucination be widened, not merely referring to factual errors, but fundamental errors in understanding the user’s request or intent, or what constitutes a task, in part because these models cannot think and do not know anything. However successful a model might be in generating something good *once*, it will also often generate something bad, or it’ll generate the right thing but in an inefficient and over-verbose fashion. You do not know what you’re going to get each time, and hallucinations multiply with the complexity of the thing you’re asking for, or whether a task contains multiple steps (which is a fatal blow to the idea of “agents.” You can add as many levels of intrigue and “reasoning” as you want, but Large Language Models cannot be trusted to do something correctly, or even consistently, every time. Model companies have successfully convinced everybody that the issue is that users are prompting the models wrong, and that people need to be “trained to use AI,” but what they’re doing is training people to explain away the inconsistencies of Large Language Models, and to assume individual responsibility for what is an innate flaw in how large language models work. Large Language Models are also uniquely expensive. Many mistakenly try and claim this is like the dot com boom or Uber, but the basic unit economics of generative AI are insane. Providers must purchase tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs each costing $50,000 a piece, and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of infrastructure for large clusters. And that’s without mentioning things like staffing, construction, power, or water. Then you turn them on and start losing money. Despite hundreds of billions of GPUs sold, nobody seems to make any money, other than NVIDIA, the company that makes them, and resellers like Dell and Supermicro who buy the GPUs, put them in servers, and sell them to other people. This arrangement works out great for Jensen Huang, and terribly for everybody else. I am going to explain the insanity of the situation we find ourselves in, and why I continue to do this work undeterred. The bubble has entered its most pornographic, aggressive and destructive stage, where the more obvious it becomes that they’re cooked, the more ridiculous the generative AI industry will act — a dark juxtaposition against every new study that says “generative AI does not work” or new story about ChatGPT’s uncanny ability to activate mental illness in people. So, let’s start simple: NVIDIA is a hardware company that sells GPUs, including the consumer GPUs that you’d see in a modern gaming PC, but when you read someone say “GPU” within the context of AI, they mean enterprise-focused GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and more modern GPUs like the Blackwell-series B200 and GB200 (which combines two GPUs with an NVIDIA CPU). These GPUs cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 (or as high as $70,000 for the newer Blackwell GPUs), and require tens of thousands of dollars more of infrastructure — networking to “cluster” server racks of GPUs together to provide compute, and massive cooling systems to deal with the massive amounts of heat they produce, as well as the servers themselves that they run on, which typically use top-of-the-line data center CPUs, and contain vast quantities of high-speed memory and storage. While the GPU itself is likely the most expensive single item within an AI server, the other costs — and I’m not even factoring in the actual physical building that the server lives in, or the water or electricity that it uses — add up. I’ve mentioned NVIDIA because it has a virtual monopoly in this space. Generative AI effectively requires NVIDIA GPUs, in part because it’s the only company really making the kinds of high-powered cards that generative AI demands, and because NVIDIA created something called CUDA — a collection of software tools that lets programmers write software that runs on GPUs, which were traditionally used primarily for rendering graphics in games. While there are open-source alternatives, as well as alternatives from Intel (with its ARC GPUs) and AMD (Nvidia’s main rival in the consumer space), these aren’t nearly as mature or feature-rich. Due to the complexities of AI models, one cannot just stand up a few of these things either — you need clusters of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of them for it to be worthwhile, making any investment in GPUs in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, especially considering they require completely different data center architecture to make them run. A common request — like asking a generative AI model to parse through thousands of lines of code and make a change or an addition — may use multiple of these $50,000 GPUs at the same time, and so if you aspire to serve thousands, or millions of concurrent users, you need to spend big. Really big. It’s these factors — the vendor lock-in, the ecosystem, and the fact that generative AI only works when you’re buying GPUs at scale — that underpin the rise of Nvidia. But beyond the economic and technical factors, there are human ones, too. To understand the AI bubble is to understand why CEOs do the things they do. Because an executive’s job is so vague, they can telegraph the value of their “labor” by spending money on initiatives and making partnerships. AI gave hyperscalers the excuse to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and buy a bunch of GPUs to go in them, because that, to the markets, looks like they’re doing something. By virtue of spending a lot of money in a frighteningly short amount of time, Satya Nadella received multiple glossy profiles, all without having to prove that AI can really do anything, be it a job or make Microsoft money. Nevertheless, AI allowed CEOs to look busy, and once the markets and journalists had agreed on the consensus opinion that “AI would be big,” all that these executives had to do was buy GPUs and “do AI.” We are in the midst of one of the darkest forms of software in history, described by many as an unwanted guest invading their products, their social media feeds, their bosses’ empty minds, and resting in the hands of monsters. Every story of its success feels bereft of any real triumph, with every literal description of its abilities involving multiple caveats about the mistakes it makes or the incredible costs of running it. Generative AI exists for two reasons: to cost money, and to make executives look busy. It was meant to be the new enterprise software and the new iPhone and the new Netflix all at once, a panacea where software guys pay one hardware guy for GPUs to unlock the incredible value creation of the future. Generative AI was always set up to fail, because it was meant to be everything, was talked about like it was everything, is still sold like it’s everything, yet for all the fucking hype, it all comes down to two companies: OpenAI, and, of course, NVIDIA. NVIDIA was, for a while, living high on the hog. All CEO Jensen Huang had to do every three months was saying “check out these numbers” and the markets and business journalists would squeal with glee, even as he said stuff like “the more you buy the more you save,” in part tipping his head to the (very real and sensible) idea of accelerated computing, but framed within the context of the cash inferno that’s generative AI, seems ludicrous. Huang’s showmanship worked really well for NVIDIA for a while, because for a while the growth was easy. Everybody was buying GPUs. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (and to a lesser extent Apple and Tesla) make up 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue, creating, at least for the first four, a degree of shared mania where everybody justified buying tens of billions of dollars of GPUs a year by saying “the other guy is doing it!” This is one of the major reasons the AI bubble is happening, because people conflated NVIDIA’s incredible sales with “interest in AI,” rather than everybody buying GPUs. Don’t worry, I’ll explain the revenue side a little bit later. We’re here for the long haul. Anyway, NVIDIA is facing a problem — that the only thing that grows forever is cancer. On September 9 2025, the Wall Street Journal said that NVIDIA’s “wow” factor was fading, going from beating analyst estimates in by nearly 21% in its Fiscal Year Q2 2024 earnings to scraping by with a mere 1.52% beat in its most-recent earnings — something that for any other company, would be a good thing, but framed against the delusional expectations that generative AI has inspired, is a figure that looks nothing short of ominous. Per the Wall Street Journal: In any other scenario, 56% year-over-year growth would lead to an abundance of Dom Perignon and Huang signing hundreds of boobs, but this is NVIDIA, and that’s just not good enough. Back in February 2024, NVIDIA was booking 265% year-over-year growth, but in its February 2025 earnings, NVIDIA only grew by a measly 78% year-over-year. It isn’t so much that NVIDIA isn’t growing, but that to grow year-over-year at the rates that people expect is insane. Life was a lot easier when NVIDIA went from $6.05 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2023 to $22 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2024, but for it to grow even 55% year-over-year from Q2 FY2026 ($46.7 billion) to Q2 2027 would require it to make $72.385 billion in revenue in the space of three months, mostly from selling GPUs (which make up around 88% of its revenue). This would put Nvidia in the ballpark of Microsoft ($76 billion in the last quarter) and within the neighborhood of Apple ($94 billion in the last quarter), predominantly making money in an industry that a year-and-a-half ago barely made the company $6 billion in a quarter. And the market needs NVIDIA to perform, as the company makes up 8% of the value of the S&P 500. It’s not enough for it to be wildly profitable, or have a monopsony on selling GPUs, or for it to have effectively 10x’d their stock in a few years. It must continue to grow at the fastest rate of anything ever, making more and more money selling these GPUs to a small group of companies that immediately start losing money once they plug them in. While a few members of the Magnificent Seven could be depended on to funnel tens of billions of dollars into a furnace each quarter, there were limits, even for companies like Microsoft, which had bought over 485,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. To take a step back, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make their money by either selling access to Large Language Models that people incorporate into their products, or by renting out servers full of GPUs to run inference (as said previously, the process to generate an output by a model or series of models) or train AI models for companies that develop and market models themselves, namely Anthropic and OpenAI. The latter revenue stream of which is where Jensen Huang found a solution to that eternal growth problem: the neocloud, namely CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius. These businesses are fairly straightforward. They own (or lease) data centers that they then fill full of servers that are full of NVIDIA GPUs, which they then rent on an hourly basis to customers, either on a per-GPU basis or in large batches for larger customers, who guarantee they'll use a certain amount of compute and sign up to long-term (i.e. more than an hour at a time) commitments. A neocloud is a specialist cloud compute company that exists only to provide access to GPUs for AI, unlike Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which have healthy businesses selling other kinds of compute, with AI (as I’ll get into later) failing to provide much of a return on investment. It’s not just the fact that these companies are more specialized than, say, Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft Azure. As you’ve gathered from the name, these are new, young, and in almost all cases, incredibly precarious businesses — each with financial circumstances that would make a Greek finance minister blush. That’s because setting up a neocloud is expensive. Even if the company in question already has data centers — as CoreWeave did with its cryptocurrency mining operation — AI requires completely new data center infrastructure to house and cool the GPUs, and those GPUs also need paying for, and then there’s the other stuff I mentioned earlier, like power, water, and the other bits of the computer (the CPU, the motherboard, the memory and storage, and the housing). As a result, these neoclouds are forced to raise billions of dollars in debt, which they collateralize using the GPUs they already have, along with contracts from customers, which they use to buy more GPUs. CoreWeave, for example, has $25 billion in debt on estimated revenues of $5.35 billion, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. You know who also invests in these neoclouds? NVIDIA! NVIDIA is also one of CoreWeave’s largest customers (accounting for 15% of its revenue in 2024), and just signed a deal to buy $6.3 billion of any capacity that CoreWeave can’t otherwise sell to someone else through 2032, an extension of a $1.3 billion 2023 deal reported by the Information. It was the anchor investor ($250 million) in CoreWeave’s IPO, too. NVIDIA is currently doing the same thing with Lambda, another neocloud that NVIDIA invested in, which also plans to go public next year. NVIDIA is also one of Lambda’s largest customers, signing a deal with it this summer to rent 10,000 GPUs for $1.3 billion over four years. In the UK, NVIDIA has just invested $700 million in Nscale, a former crypto miner that has never built an AI data center, and that has, despite having no experience, committed $1 billion (and/or 100,000 GPUs) to an OpenAI data center in Norway. On Thursday, September 25, Nscale announced it had closed another funding round, with NVIDIA listed as a main backer — although it’s unclear how much money it put in. It would be safe to assume it’s another few hundred million. NVIDIA also invested in Nebius, an outgrowth of Russian conglomerate Yandex, and Nebius provides, through a partnership with NVIDIA, tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of compute credits to companies in NVIDIA’s Inception startup program. NVIDIA’s plan is simple: fund these neoclouds, let these neoclouds load themselves up with debt, at which point they buy GPUs from NVIDIA, which can then be used as collateral for loans, along with contracts from customers, allowing the neoclouds to buy even more GPUs. It’s like that Robinhood infinite money glitch… …except, that is, for one small problem. There don’t appear to be that many customers. As I went into recently on my premium newsletter, NVIDIA funds and sustains Neoclouds as a way of funnelling revenue to itself, as well as partners like Supermicro and Dell, resellers that take NVIDIA GPUs and put them in servers to sell pre-built to customers. These two companies made up 39% of NVIDIA’s revenues last quarter. Yet when you remove hyperscaler revenue — Microsoft, Amazon, Google, OpenAI and NVIDIA — from the revenues of these neoclouds, there’s barely $1 billion in revenue combined, across CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda. CoreWeave’s $5.35 billion revenue is predominantly made up of its contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft (offering compute for OpenAI), Google (hiring CoreWeave to offer compute for OpenAI), and OpenAI itself, which has promised CoreWeave $22.4 billion in business over the next few years. This is all a lot of stuff, so I’ll make it really simple: there is no real money in offering AI compute, but that isn’t Jensen Huang’s problem, so he will simply force NVIDIA to hand money to these companies so that they have contracts to point to when they raise debt to buy more NVIDIA GPUs. Neoclouds are effectively giant private equity vehicles that exist to raise money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, or for hyperscalers to move money around so that they don’t increase their capital expenditures and can, as Microsoft did earlier in the year, simply walk away from deals they don’t like. Nebius’ “$17.4 billion deal” with Microsoft even included a clause in its 6-K filing that Microsoft can terminate the deal in the event the capacity isn’t built by the delivery dates, and Nebius has already used the contract to raise $3 billion to… build the data center to provide compute for the contract. Here, let me break down the numbers: From my analysis, it appears that CoreWeave, despite expectations to make that $5.35 billion this year, has only around $500 million of non-Magnificent Seven or OpenAI AI revenue in 2025, with Lambda estimated to have around $100 million in AI revenue, and Nebius around $250 million without Microsoft’s share, and that’s being generous. In simpler terms, the Magnificent Seven is the AI bubble, and the AI bubble exists to buy more GPUs, because (as I’ll show) there’s no real money or growth coming out of this, other than in the amount that private credit is investing — “$50 billion a quarter, for the low end, for the past three quarters.” I dunno man, let’s start simple: $50 billion a quarter of data center funding is going into an industry that has less revenue than Genshin Impact. That feels pretty bad. Who’s gonna use these data centers? How are they going to even make money on them? Private equity firms don’t typically hold onto assets, they sell them or take them public. Doesn’t seem great to me! Anyway, if AI was truly the next big growth vehicle, neoclouds would be swimming in diverse global revenue streams. Instead, they’re heavily-centralized around the same few names, one of which (NVIDIA) directly benefits from their existence not as a company doing business, but as an entity that can accrue debt and spend money on GPUs. These Neoclouds are entirely dependent on a continual flow of private credit from firms like Goldman Sachs (Nebius, CoreWeave, Lambda for its IPO), JPMorgan (Lambda, Crusoe, CoreWeave), and Blackstone (Lambda, CoreWeave), who have in a very real sense created an entire debt-based infrastructure to feed billions of dollars directly to NVIDIA, all in the name of an AI revolution that's yet to arrive. The fact that the rest of the neocloud revenue stream is effectively either a hyperscaler or OpenAI is also concerning. Hyperscalers are, at this point, the majority of data center capital expenditures, and have yet to prove any kind of success from building out this capacity, outside, of course, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, which has succeeded in generating revenue while burning billions of dollars. Hyperscaler revenue is also capricious, but even if it isn’t, why are there no other major customers? Why, across all of these companies, does there not seem to be one major customer who isn’t OpenAI? The answer is obvious: nobody that wants it can afford it, and those who can afford it don’t need it. It’s also unclear what exactly hyperscalers are doing with this compute, because it sure isn’t “making money.” While Microsoft makes $10 billion in revenue from renting compute to OpenAI via Microsoft Azure, it does so at-cost, and was charging OpenAI $1.30-per-hour for each A100GPU it rents, a loss of $2.2 an hour per GPU, meaning that it is likely losing money on this compute, especially as SemiAnalysis has the total cost per hour per GPU at around $1.46 with the cost of capital and debt associated for a hyperscaler, though it’s unclear if that’s for an H100 or A100 GPU. In any case, how do these neoclouds pay for their debt if the hyperscalers give up, or NVIDIA doesn’t send them money, or, more likely, private credit begins to notice that there’s no real revenue growth outside of circular compute deals with neoclouds’ largest supplier, investor and customer? They don’t! In fact, I have serious concerns that they can’t even build the capacity necessary to fulfil these deals, but nobody seems to worry about that. No, really! It appears to be taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of compute capacity. How exactly are any of these neoclouds (or Oracle itself) able to expand to actually capture this revenue? Who knows! But I assume somebody is going to say “OpenAI!” Here’s an insane statistic for you: OpenAI will account for — in both its own revenue (projected $13 billion) and in its own compute costs ($16 billion, according to The Information, although that figure is likely out of date, and seemingly only includes the compute it’ll use, and not that it has committed to build, and thus has spent money on) — about 50% of all AI revenues in 2025. That figure takes into account the $400m ARR for ServiceNow, Adobe, and Salesforce; the $35bn in revenue for the Magnificent Seven from AI (not profit, and based on figures from the previous year); revenue from neoclouds like CoreWeave, Nebius, and Lambda; and the estimated revenue from the entire generative AI industry (including Anthropic and other smaller players, like Perplexity and Anysphere) for a total of $55bn.OpenAI is the generative AI industry — and it’s a dog of a company. As a reminder, OpenAI has leaked that it’ll burn $115 billion in the next four years, and based on my estimates, it needs to raise more than $290 billion in the next four years based on its $300 billion deal with Oracle alone. That alone is a very, very bad sign, especially as we’re three years and $500 billion or more into this hype cycle with few signs of life outside of, well, OpenAI promising people money. Credit to Anthony Restaino for this horrifying graphic: This is not what a healthy, stable industry looks like. Alright, well, things can’t be that bad on the software side. Right? Right? As I covered on my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, everybody is losing money on generative AI, in part because the cost of running AI models is increasing, and in part because the software itself doesn’t do enough to warrant the costs associated with running them, which are already subsidized and unprofitable for the model providers. Outside of OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Anthropic), nobody seems to be making much revenue, with the most “successful” company being Anysphere, makers of AI coding tool Cursor, which hit $500 million ‘annualized” (so $41.6 million in one month) a few months ago, just before Anthropic and OpenAI jacked up the prices for “priority processing” on enterprise queries, raising its operating costs as a result. In any case, that’s some piss-poor revenue for an industry that’s meant to be the future of software. Smartwatches are projected to make $32 billion this year, and as mentioned, the Magnificent Seven expects to make $35 billion or so in revenue from AI this year. Even Anthropic and OpenAI seem a little lethargic, both burning billions of dollars while making, by my estimates, no more than $2 billion and $6.26 billion in 2025 so far, despite projections of $5 billion and $13 billion respectively. Outside of these two, AI startups are floundering, struggling to stay alive and raising money in several-hundred million dollar bursts as their negative-gross-margin businesses flounder. As I dug into a few months ago, I could find only 12 AI-powered companies making more than $8.3 million a month, with two of them slightly improving their revenues, specifically AI search company Perplexity (which has now hit $150 million ARR, or $12.5 million in a month) and AI coding startup Replit (which also hit $150 million ARR in September). Both of these companies burn ridiculous amounts of money. Perplexity burned 164% of its revenue on Amazon Web Services, OpenAI and Anthropic last year, and while Replit hasn’t leaked its costs, The Information reports its gross margins in July were 23%, which doesn’t include the costs of its free users, which you simply have to do with LLMs as free users are capable of costing you a hell of a lot of money. Problematically, your paid users can also cost you more than they bring in as well. In fact, every user loses you money in generative AI, because it’s impossible to do cost control in a consistent manner. A few months ago, I did a piece about Anthropic losing money on every single Claude Code subscriber, and I’ll walk you through it in a very simplified fashion: Anthropic is, to be clear, the second-largest model developer, and has some of the best AI talent in the industry. It has a better handle on its infrastructure than anyone outside of big tech and OpenAI. It still cannot seem to fix this problem, even with weekly rate limits. While one could assume that Anthropic is simply letting people run wild, my theory is far simpler: even the model developers have no real way of limiting user activity, likely due to the architecture of generative AI. I know it sounds insane, but at the most advanced level, model providers are still prompting their models, and whatever rate limits may be in place appear to, at times, get completely ignored, and there doesn’t seem to be anything they can do to stop it. No, really. Anthropic counts amongst its capitalist apex predators one lone Chinese man who spent $50,000 of their compute in the space of a month fucking around with Claude Code. Even if Anthropic was profitable — it isn’t, and will burn billions this year — a customer paying $200-a-month running up $50,000 in costs immediately devours the margin of any user running the service that day, if not that week or month. Even if Anthropic’s costs are half the published rates, one guy amounted to 125 users’ monthly revenue. That’s not a real business! That’s a bad business with out-of-control costs, and it doesn’t appear anybody has these costs under control. A few weeks ago, Replit — an unprofitable AI coding company — released a product called “Agent 3.” which promised to be “10x more autonomous” and offer “infinitely more possibilities,” “[testing] and [fixing] its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop.” In reality, this means you’d go and tell the model to build something and it would “go do it,” and you’ll be shocked to hear that these models can’t be relied upon to “go and do” anything. Please note that this was launched a few months after Replit raised its prices, shifting to obfuscated “effort-based” pricing that would charge “the full scope of the agent’s work.” Agent 3 has been a disaster. Users found tasks that previously cost a few dollars were spiralling into the hundreds of dollars, with The Register reporting one customer found themselves with a $1000 bill after a week: Another user complained that “costs skyrocketed, without any concrete results”: As I previously reported, in late May/early June, both OpenAI and Anthropic cranked up the pricing on their enterprise customers, leading to Replit and Cursor both shifting their prices. This abuse has now trickled down to their customers. Replit has now released an update that lets you choose how autonomous you want Agent 3 to be, which is a tacit admission that you can’t trust coding LLMs to build software. Replit’s users are still pissed off, complaining that Replit is charging them for activity when the agent doesn’t do anything, a consistent problem across its Reddit. While Reddit is not the full summation of all users across every company, it’s a fairly good barometer of user sentiment, and man, are users pissy. Traditionally, Silicon Valley startups have relied upon the same model of “grow really fast and burn a bunch of money, then “turn the profit lever.” AI does not have a “profit lever,” because the raw costs of providing access to AI models are so high (and they’re only increasing) that the basic economics of how the tech industry sells software don’t make sense. I’ll reiterate something I wrote a few weeks ago: In simpler terms, it is very, very difficult to imagine what one user — free or otherwise — might cost, and thus it’s hard to charge them on a monthly basis, or tell them what a service might cost them on average. This is a huge problem with AI coding environments. According to The Information, Claude Code was driving “nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from a few weeks ago” on July 31 2025. That annualized revenue works out to about $33 million a month in revenue for a company that predicts it will make at least $416 million a month by the end of the year, and for a product that has become the most-popular coding environment in the world, from the second-largest and best-funded AI company in the world. …is that it? Is that all that’s happening here? $33 million dollars, all of it unprofitable, after it felt, at least based on social media chatter and discussing with multiple different software engineers, that Claude Code had become ubiquitous with anything to do with LLMs. To be clear, Anthropic’s Sonnet and Opus models are consistently some of the most popular for programming on Openrouter, an aggregator of LLM usage, and Anthropic has been consistently-named as “the best at coding.” Some bright spark out there is going to say that Microsoft’s Github Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and guess what, that’s true, and in fact, I reported it! Here’s another fun fact: the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft loses “on average more than $20-a-month-per-user,” with “...some users [costing] the company as much as $80.” And that’s for the most-popular product! If you believe the New York Times or other outlets that simply copy and paste whatever Dario Amodei says, you’d think that the reason that software engineers are having trouble finding work is because their jobs are being replaced by AI. This grotesque, abusive, manipulative and offensive lie has been propagated throughout the entire business and tech media without anybody sitting down and asking whether it’s true, or even getting a good understanding of what it is that LLMs can actually do with code. Members of the media, I am begging you, stop doing this. I get it, every asshole is willing to give a quote saying that “coding is dead,” and that every executive is willing to burp out some nonsense about replacing all of their engineers, but I am fucking begging you to either use these things yourself, or speak to people that do. I am not a coder. I cannot write or read code. Nevertheless, I am capable of learning, and have spoken to numerous software engineers in the last few months, and basically reached a consensus of “this is kind of useful, sometimes.” However, one very silly man once said that I don’t speak to people who use these tools, so I went and spoke to three notable, experienced software engineers, and asked them to give me the straight truth about what coding LLMs can do. In simple terms, LLMs are capable of writing code, but can’t do software engineering, because software engineering is the process of understanding, maintaining and executing code to produce functional software, and LLMs do not “learn,” cannot “adapt,” and (to paraphrase Brown), break down the more of your code and variables you ask them to look at at once. It’s very easy to believe that software engineering is just writing code, but the reality is that software engineers maintain software, which includes writing and analyzing code among a vast array of different personalities and programs and problems. Good software engineering harkens back to Brian Merchant’s interviews with translators — while some may believe that translators simply tell you what words mean, true translation is communicating the meaning of a sentence, which is cultural, contextual, regional, and personal, and often requires the exercise of creativity and novel thinking. My editor, Matthew Hughes, gave an example of this in his newsletter: Similarly, coding is not just “a series of text that programs a computer,” but a series of interconnected characters that refers to other software in other places that must also function now and explain, on some level, to someone who has never, ever seen the code before, why it was done this way. This is, by the way, why we are still yet to get any tangible proof that AI is replacing software engineers…because it can’t. Of all the fields supposedly at risk from “AI disruption,” coding feels (or felt) the most tangible, if only because the answer to “can you write code with LLMs” wasn’t an immediate, unilateral no. The media has also been quick to say that AI “writes software,” which is true in the same way that ChatGPT “writes novels”. In reality, LLMs can generate code, and do some software engineering-adjacent tasks, but, like all Large Language Models, break down and go totally insane, hallucinating more as the tasks get more complex. And, as I pointed out earlier, software engineering is not just coding. It involves thinking about problems, finding solutions to novel challenges, designing stuff in a way that can be read and maintained by others, and that’s (ideally) scalable and secure. The whole fucking point of an “AI” is that you hand shit off to it! That’s what they’ve been selling it as! That’s why Jensen Huang told kids to stop learning to code, as with AI, there’s no point. And it was all a lie. Generative AI can’t do the job of a software engineer, and it fails while also costing abominable amounts of money. Coding LLMs seem like magic at first, because they (to quote a conversation with Carl Brown) make the easy things easier, but they also make the harder things harder. They don’t even speed up engineers — they actually make them slower! Yet coding is basically the only obvious use case for LLMs. I’m sure you’re gonna say “but I bet the enterprise is doing well!” and you are so very, very wrong. Before I go any further, let’s establish some facts: All of this is to say that Microsoft has one of the largest commercial software empires in history, thousands (if not tens of thousands) of salespeople, and thousands of companies that literally sell Microsoft services for a living. And it can’t sell AI. A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers. This would amount to, if each of these users paid annually at the full rate of $30-a-month, to about $2.88 billion in annual revenue for a product category that makes $33 billion a fucking quarter. And I must be clear, I am 100% sure these users aren’t all paying $30 a month. The Information reported a few weeks ago that Microsoft has been “reducing the software’s price with more generous discounts on the AI features, according to customers and salespeople,” heavily suggesting discounts had already been happening. Enterprise software is traditionally sold at a discount anyway — or, put a different way, with bulk pricing for those who sign up a bunch of users at once. In fact, I’ve found evidence that it’s been doing this a while, with a 15% discount on annual Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions for orders of 10-to-300 seats mentioned by an IT consultant back in late 2024, and another that’s currently running through September 30, 2025 through Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider program, with up to 2400 licenses discounted if you pay upfront for the year. Microsoft seems to do this a lot, as I found another example of an offer that ran from January 1 2025 through March 31 2025. An “active” user is someone who has taken one action on Copilot in any Microsoft 365 app in the space of 28 days. Now, I know. That word, active. Maybe you’re thinking “Ed, this is like the gym model! There are unpaid licenses that Microsoft is getting paid for!” Fine! Let’s assume that Microsoft also has, based on research that suggests this is the case for all software companies, another 50% — four million — of paid Copilot licenses that aren’t being used. That still makes this 12 million users, which is still a putrid 2.72% conversion rate. So, why aren’t people paying for Copilot? Let’s hear from someone who talked to The Information: Microsoft 365 Copilot has been such a disaster that Microsoft will now integrate Anthropic’s models in an attempt and make them better. Oh, one other thing: sources also confirm GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%. I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August. So, The Information reported a few months ago that Microsoft’s projected AI revenues would be $13 billion, with $10 billion of that from OpenAI, leaving about $3 billion of total revenue across Microsoft 365 Copilot and any other foreseeable feature that Microsoft sells with “AI” on it. This heavily suggests that Microsoft is making somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on Azure or Microsoft 365 Copilot, though I suppose there are other places it could be making AI revenue too. Right? I guess. In any case, Microsoft’s net income (read: profit) in its last quarterly earnings was $27.2 billion. Pathetic. One of the comfortable lies that people tell themselves is that the AI bubble is similar to the fiber boom, or the dot com bubble, or Uber, or that we’re in the “growth stage,” or that “this is what software companies do, they spend a bunch of money then “pull the profit lever.” This is nothing like anything you’ve seen before, because this is the dumbest shit that the tech industry has ever done. AI data centers are nothing like fiber, because there are very few actual use cases for these GPUs outside of AI, and none of them are remotely hyperscale revenue drivers. As I discussed a month or so ago, data center development accounted for more of America’s GDP growth than all consumer spending combined, and there really isn’t any demand for AI in general, let alone at the scale that these hundreds of billions of dollars are being sunk into. The conservative estimate of capital expenditures related to data centers is around $400 billion, but given the $50 billion a quarter in private credit, I’m going to guess it breaks $500 billion, all to build capacity for an industry yet to prove itself. And this NVIDIA-OpenAI “$100 billion funding” news should only fill you full of dread, but also it isn’t fucking finalized, stop reporting it as if it’s done, I swear to god- Anyway, according to CNBC, “the initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized,” with “successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company’s then-current valuation as new capacity comes online.” At no point is anyone asking how, exactly, OpenAI builds data centers to fill full of these GPUs. In fact, I am genuinely shocked (and a little disgusted!) by how poorly this story has been told. Let’s go point by point: To be clear, when I say OpenAI needs at least $300 billion over the next four years, that’s if you believe its projections, which you shouldn’t. Let’s walk through its (alleged) numbers, while plagiarizing myself: According to The Information, here's the breakdown (these are projections): OpenAI's current reported burn is $116 billion through 2030, which means there is no way that these projections include $300 billion in compute costs, even when you factor in revenue. There is simply no space in these projections to absorb that $300 billion, and from what I can tell, by 2029, OpenAI will have actually burned more than $290 billion, assuming that it survives that long, which I do not believe it will. Don’t worry, though. OpenAI is about to make some crazy money. Here are the projections that CFO Sarah Friar signed off on: Just so we are clear, OpenAI intends to 10x its revenue in the space of four years, selling software and access to models in an industry with about $60 billion of revenue in 2025. How will it do this? It doesn’t say. I don’t know OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, but I do know that signing off on these numbers is, at the very least, ethically questionable. Putting aside the ridiculousness of OpenAI’s deals, or its funding requirements, Friar has willfully allowed Sam Altman and OpenAI to state goals that defy reality or good sense, all to take advantage of investors and public markets that have completely lost the plot. I need to be blunter: OpenAI has signed multiple different deals and contracts for amounts it cannot afford to pay, that it cannot hope to raise the money to pay for, that defy the amounts of venture capital and private credit available, all to sustain a company that will burn $300 billion and has no path to profitability of any kind. So, as I said above, CNBC reported on September 23, 2025 that the NVIDIA deal will be delivered in $10 billion tranches, the first of which is “expected to close within a month,” and the rest delivered “as new capacity comes online.” This is, apparently, all part of a plan to build 10GW of data center capacity with NVIDIA. A few key points: So, let’s start simple: data centers take forever to build. As I said previously, based on current reports, it’s taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of data center capacity, and nowhere in these reports does one reporter take a second to say “hey, what data centers are you talking about?” or “hey, didn’t Sam Altman say back in July that he was building 10GW of data center capacity with Oracle?” But wait, now Oracle and OpenAI have done another announcement that says they’re only doing 7GW, but they’re “ahead of schedule” on 10GW? Wait, is NVIDIA’s 10GW the same 10GW as Oracle and OpenAI are working on? Is it different? Nobody seems to know or care! Anyway, I cannot be clear enough how unlikely it is that (as NVIDIA has said) “the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026,” and that’s if it has bought the land and got the permits and ordered the construction, none of which has happened yet. But let’s get really specific on costs! Crusoe’s 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI is a $15 billion joint venture, which means a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion. Abilene’s eight buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let’s say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs. Though this math is a little funky due to NVIDIA promising to install its new Rubin GPUs in these theoretical data centers, that means these data centers will require a little under $200 billion worth of GPUs. By my maths that’s $325 billion. I’m so tired of this. A number of you have sent me the following image with some sort of comment about how “this is how it’ll work,” and you are wrong, because this is neither how it works nor how it will work nor accurate on any level. In the current relationship, NVIDIA Is Not Sending OpenAI $100 Billion, nor will it send it that much money, because 90% of OpenAI’s funding is gated behind building 9 or 10 gigawatts of data center capacity. In the current relationship, OpenAI does not have the money to pay Oracle. Also, can Oracle even afford to give that much money to NVIDIA? It had negative free cash flow last quarter, already has $104 billion in debt, and its biggest new customer cannot afford a single fucking thing it’s promised. The only company in this diagram that actually can afford to do any of this shit is NVIDIA, and even then it only has $56 billion cash on hand. In any case, as I went over on Friday, OpenAI has promised about a trillion dollars between compute contracts across Oracle, Microsoft, Google and CoreWeave, 17 Gigawatts of promised data centers in America between NVIDIA and “Stargate,” several more gigawatts of international data centers, custom chips from Broadcom, and their own company operations. How exactly does this get paid for? Nobody seems to ask these questions! Why am I the asshole doing this? Don’t we have tech analysts that are meant to analyse shit? AHhhhh- Every time I sit down to write about this subject the newsletters seem to get longer, because people are so painfully attached to the norms and tropes of the past. This post is, already, 17,500 words — a record for this newsletter — and I’ve still not finished editing and expanding it. What we’re witnessing is one of the most egregious wastes of capital in history, sold by career charlatans with their reputations laundered by a tech and business media afraid to criticize the powerful and analysts that don’t seem to want to tell their investors the truth. There are no historic comparisons here — even Britain’s abominable 1800s railway bubble, which absorbed half of the country’s national income, created valuable infrastructure for trains, a vehicle that can move people to and from places. GPUs are not trains, nor are they cars, or even CPUs. They are not adaptable to many other kinds of work, nor are they “the infrastructure of the future of tech,” because they’re already quite old and with everybody focused on buying them, you’d absolutely see one other use case by now that actually mattered. GPUs are expensive, power-hungry, environmentally destructive and require their own kinds of cooling and server infrastructure, making every GPU data center and environmental and fiscal bubble unto themselves. And, whereas the Victorian train infrastructure still exists in the UK — though it has been upgraded over the years — a GPU has a limited useful lifespan. These are cards that can — and will — break after a period of extended usage, whether that period is five years or later, and they’ll inevitably be superseded by something better and more powerful, meaning that the resale value of that GPU will only go down, with a price depreciation that’s akin to a new car. I am telling you, as I have been telling you for years, again and again and again, that the demand is not there for generative AI, and the demand is never, ever arriving. The only reason anyone humours any of this crap is the endless hoarding of GPUs to build capacity for a revolution that will never arrive. Well, that and OpenAI, a company built and sold on lies about ChatGPT’s capabilities. ChatGPT’s popularity — and OpenAI’s hunger for endless amounts of compute — have created the illusion of demand due to the sheer amount of capacity required to keep their services operational, all so they can burn $8 billion or more in 2025 and, if my estimates are right, nearly a trillion dollars by 2030. This NVIDIA deal is a farce — an obvious attempt by the largest company on the American stock market to prop up the one significant revenue-generator in the entire industry, knowing that time is running out for it to create new avenues for eternal growth. I’d argue that NVIDIA’s deal also shows the complete contempt that these companies have for the media. There are no details about how this deal works beyond the initial $10 billion, there’s no land purchased, no data center construction started, and yet the media slurps it down without a second thought. I am but one man, and I am fucking peculiar. I did not learn financial analysis in school, but I appear to be one of the few people doing even the most basic analysis of these deals, and while I’m having a great time doing so, I am also exceedingly frustrated at how little effort is being put into prying apart these deals. I realize how ridiculous all of this sounds. I get it. There’s so much money being promised to so many people, market rallies built off the back of massive deals, and I get that the assumption is that this much money can’t be wrong, that this many people wouldn’t just say stuff without intending to follow through, or without considering whether their company could afford it. I know it’s hard to conceive that hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested in something for no apparent reason, but it’s happening, right god damn now, in front of your eyes, and I am going to be merciless on anyone who attempts to write a “how could we see this coming?” Generative AI has never been reliable, has always been unprofitable, and has always been unsustainable, and I’ve been saying so since February 2024. The economics have never made sense, something I’ve said repeatedly since April 2024, and when I wrote “How Does OpenAI Survive?” in July 2024, I had multiple people suggest I was being alarmist. Here’s some alarmism for you: the longer it takes for OpenAI to die, the more damage it will cause to the tech industry. On Friday, when I put out my piece on OpenAI needing a trillion dollars, I asked analyst Gil Luria if the capital was there to build the 17 Gigawatts that OpenAI had allegedly planned to build. He said the following: That doesn’t sound good! Anyway, as I discussed earlier, venture capital could run out in six quarters, with investor and researcher Jon Sakoda estimating that there will only be around $164 billion of dry powder (available capital) in US VC firms by the end of 2025. In July, The French Tech Journal reported (using Pitchbook data) that global venture capital deal activity reached its lowest first-half total since 2018, with $139.4 billion in deal value in the first half of 2025, down from $183.4 billion in the first half of 2024, meaning that any further expansion or demands for venture capital from OpenAI will likely sap the dwindling funds available from other startups. Things get worse when you narrow things to US venture capital. In a piece from April, EY reported that VC-backed investment in US companies hit $80 billion in Q1 2025, but “one $40 billion deal” accounted for half of the investment — OpenAI’s $40 billion deal of which only $10 billion has actually closed, and that didn’t happen until fucking June. Without the imaginary money from OpenAI, US venture would have declined by 36%. The longer that OpenAI survives, the longer it will sap the remaining billions from the tech ecosystem, and I expect it to extend its tendrils to private credit too. The $325 billion it needs just to fulfil its NVIDIA contract, albeit over 4 years, is an egregious sum that I believe exceeds the available private capital in the world. Let’s get specific, and check out the top 10 private equity firms’ available capital! Assuming that all of this capital is currently available, the top 10 private equity firms in the world have around $477 billion of available capital. We can, of course, include investment banks — Goldman Sachs had around $520 billion cash in hand available at the end of its last quarter, and JPMorgan over $1.7 trillion, but JP Morgan has only dedicated $50 billion in direct lending commitments as of February 2025, and while Goldman Sachs expanded its direct private credit lending by $15 billion back in June, that appears to be an extension of its “more than $20 billion” direct lending close from mid-2024. Include both of those, and that brings us up to — if we assume that all of these funds are available — $562 billion in capital and about $164 billion in US venture available to spend, and that’s meant to go to more places than just OpenAI. Sure, sure, there’s more than just the top 10 private equity firms and there’s venture money outside of the US, but what could it be? Like, another $150 billion? You see, OpenAI needs to buy those GPUs, and it needs to build those data centers, and it needs to pay its thousands of staff and marketing and sales costs too. While OpenAI likely wouldn’t be the ones raising the money for the data centers — and honestly, I’m not sure who would do it at this point? — somebody is going to need to build TWENTY GIGAWATTS OF DATA CENTERS if we’re to believe both Oracle and NVIDIA You may argue that venture funds and private credit can raise more, and you’re right! But at this point, there have been few meaningful acquisitions of AI companies, and zero exits from the billions of dollars put into data centers. Even OpenAI admits in its own announcement about new Stargate sites that this will be a “$400 billion investment over 3 years.” Where the fuck is that money coming from? Is OpenAI really going to absorb massive chunks of all available private credit and venture capital for the next few years? And no, god, stop saying the US government will bail this out. It will have to bail out hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no scenario where it’s anything less than that, and I’ve already been over this. While the US government has spent equivalent sums in the past to support private business (the total $440 billion dispersed during the Great Recession’s TARP program, where the Treasury bought toxic assets from investment banks to stop them from imploding a la Lehman, springs to mind), it’s hard to imagine any case where OpenAI is seen as vital to the global financial system — and the economic health of the US — as the banking system. Sure, we spent around $1tn — if we’re being specific, $953bn — on the Paycheck Protection Program during the Covid era, but that was to keep people employed at a time when the economy outside of Zoom and Walmart had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist. There was an urgency that doesn’t apply here. If OpenAI goes tits up, Softbank loses some money — nothing new there — and Satya Nadella has to explain why he spent tens of billions of dollars on a bunch of data centers filled with $50,000 GPUs that are, at this point, ornamental. And while there will be — and have been — disastrous economic consequences, they won’t be as systemically catastrophic as that of the pandemic, or the global financial crisis. To be clear, it’ll be bad, but not as bad. And there’s also the problem of moral hazard — if the government steps in, what’s to stop big tech chasing its next fruitless rainbow? — and optics. If people resented bailing out the banks after they acted like profligate gamblers and lost, how will they feel bailing out fucking Sam Altman and Jensen Huang? I do apologize for the length of this piece, but the significance of this bubble requires depth. There is little demand, little real money, and little reason to continue, and the sheer lack of responsibility and willingness to kneel before the powerful fills me full of angry bile. I understand many journalists are not in a position where they can just write “this shit sounds stupid,” but we have entered a deeply stupid era, and by continuing to perpetuate the myth of AI, the media guarantees that retail investors and regular people’s 401Ks will suffer. It is now inevitable that this bubble bursts. Deutsche Bank has said the AI boom is unsustainable outside of tech spending “remaining parabolic,” which it says “is highly unlikely,” and Bain Capital has said that $2 trillion in new revenue is needed to fund AI’s scaling, and even that math is completely fucked as it talks about “AI-related savings”: Even when stared in the face by a ridiculous idea — $2 trillion of new revenue in a global software market that’s expected to be around $817 billion in 2025 — Bain still oinks out some nonsense about the “savings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support and R&D,” yet another myth perpetuated I assume to placate the fucking morons sinking billions into this. Every single “vibe coding is the future,” “the power of AI,” and “AI job loss” story written perpetuates a myth that will only lead to more regular people getting hurt when the bubble bursts. Every article written about OpenAI or NVIDIA or Oracle that doesn’t explicitly state that the money doesn’t exist, that the revenues are impossible, that one of the companies involved burns billions of dollars and has no path to profitability, is an act of irresponsible make believe and mythos. I am nobody. I am not a financier. I am not anybody special. I just write a lot, and read a lot, and can do the most basic maths in the world. I am not trying to be anything other than myself, nor do I have an agenda, other than the fact that I like doing this and I hate how this story is being told. I never planned for this newsletter to get this big, and now that it has, I’m going to keep doing the same thing every week. I also believe that the way to stop this happening again is to have a thorough and well-sourced explanation of everything as it happens, ripping down the narratives as they’re spun and making it clear who benefits from them and how and why they’re choosing to do so. When things collapse, we need to be clear about how many times people chose to look the other way, or to find good faith ways to interpret bad faith announcements and leak.
