Description: I am finding it very hard to swallow the disaster that has occurred in Syria, or to digest its consequences. It makes me sick. Though it foresaw the looming disaster, my last article was written just before the flight of Assad and the fall of Damascus, and it…

Wells Fargo & Co. said it’s leaving the world’s biggest climate alliance for banks, in the latest sign that Wall Street is breaking away from such groups. The company said in a statement Friday that it ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. The bank, based in San Francisco, didn’t provide an explanation for its decision. Wells Fargo’s departure follows Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which announced earlier this month that it was quitting NZBA. Financial companies have been under increasing pressure from Republican lawmakers, which have launched investigations and filed lawsuits related to the industry’s efforts to address climate change. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, said last week that it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by financial companies. Separately, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. have been sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. In a report, Jordan’s committee specifically criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it calls “a climate cartel.” NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was launched ahead of a key climate summit in Scotland in 2021. Back then, the world’s biggest lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., joined the coalition. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s withdrawal from NZBA was linked to his office’s review of the bank’s “status as a potential boycotter of energy companies.” “I urge other financial institutions to follow their example and end ESG (environmental, social and governance) policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries” Paxton said. Wells Fargo’s decision was based on the company’s internal analysis, said a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified. A spokesman for NZBA said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s departure was “based on its own individual circumstances.” He added that five banks have left the group since it started in 2021, while more than 100 have joined. NZBA’s member banks have made “significant progress” in setting net zero targets, he said. Wells Fargo is one of the largest financiers for the fossil-fuel industry. It ranks as the second-leading arranger of bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies since the start of the decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is first. Banks and money managers have been defecting from other climate groups in increasing numbers amid GOP-led pressure. This month, Franklin Templeton said it was leaving Climate Action 100+, which was created to press high-polluting companies to curb their emissions. The investment firm two years ago hired Anne Simpson, who was the first chair of CA100+, as its global head of sustainability.

Title: ‘I love kicking footballs’ – Andy Quinn follows his own star to pursue NFL goal

For a phenomenon that is only a few years old, the story risks becoming repetitive. An Irish lad who grew up playing a kicking sport realises he’s a naturally better ball-striker than Americans lacking the same GAA, rugby or soccer background. He has a go at kicking a pigskin. The ball flies off the boot. American colleges or sometimes even NFL franchises have their heads turned. For all the growing familiarity with Ireland’s newfound relationship with the gridiron, Andy Quinn’s story still stands out. The Creggs native was an outhalf at Blackrock College. He played at youth level for Connacht. While his Junior Cup year was disrupted by Covid, Quinn still might have pulled on the 10 jersey during a Senior Cup run. He gave it up. Instead, he finished school in England – if school is the right word. Quinn sat his Leaving Cert while attending the NFL Academy in Loughborough. In his own words, it was “Blackrock College but for American football, but then on steroids” – of the metaphorical, not literal kind. The move paid off. Quinn earned a scholarship to kick and punt at Boston College. His flight leaves in January. Next year, Boston College’s schedule includes dates with Michigan State, Cal Berkley, Clemson, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame and Stanford. Recruited as both a kicker and punter, Quinn is more likely to see early game time in the latter role. He may or may not become the next Irishman in the NFL after Dan Whelan, Jude McAtamney and Charlie Smyth, but he will get a degree. In recent years, the National Collegiate Athletics Association started allowing unpaid student athletes to finally take some share of the billions they generate as part of America’s obsession with college sports. Players can now profit off their name, image and likeness (NIL). On top of that, some schools will soon start sharing their revenue with players. One figure involved in college sports suggests that kickers and punters can earn anywhere from $50,000-$300,000 a year. Like plenty of us, Quinn needed something to keep him sane during the pandemic lockdowns. In true Irish outhalf fashion, he became “obsessed” with training his place kicking. Listening to him talk technique, he isn’t lying. “It was like a round of golf for me,” he explains. “I’d kick the balls in, kick them over the bar and then kick them back out. I’d do that for five or six hours, three or four times a week. Through that, my rugby kicking became quite good but I never knew it would transfer into another sport. “Anyone I was following on Instagram was to do with kicking a rugby ball and also gym work. My phone was clogged up with videos of me kicking. After doing it for a while, it was pretty obvious to me that if I missed and it went left, I didn’t have a strong enough follow through. I always found that it was my foot contact and follow through that were the determining factors if the ball went over the bar or not.” Originally from Creggs on the Roscommon-Galway border (Quinn supports Galway, for what it’s worth), he went down the Caelan Doris route of moving from out west to board at Blackrock. Aged 15, Connacht started taking notice. He didn’t always line out at outhalf. Listed at 6ft 4ins, a growth spurt one summer left Quinn close to that height at an early enough stage. Blackrock took one look at him and stuck him in the second row as a lineout jumper. While there’s a bit of muscle on the frame now, he’s no Joe McCarthy. Had Quinn stuck at rugby and progressed through the system, Sam Prendergast wouldn’t have been the only outhalf being asked questions about his slight frame. “It helped a lot because I was skinny so they could throw me up in the lineout, literally fire me up,” says Quinn, laughing. “I was flying for a little bit. I was playing secondrow for Blackrock College, then for my club team Buccaneers I was playing outhalf. I was still kicking.” The summer before his fifth year at school, Quinn found Tadhg Leader, another former rugby player who is driving Ireland’s burgeoning American football involvement. Leader set up a competition, Ireland’s Kicking King. Quinn won it by landing field goals during the half-time break of a college game at the Aviva Stadium. Two days later, he was back at school on the Rock Road. The NFL Academy needed a kicker. They were impressed that Quinn, aged 16 at the time, could land 45-yard field goals in front of a big crowd at Lansdowne Road only shortly after taking up the sport. Or so the story goes. “That’s what the NFL Academy coaches told me, so I’m gonna go with that,” jokes Quinn. “I was there for one year, my whole year in sixth year. I had to study the Leaving Cert on my own. I didn’t go to any classes, I was in Loughborough and I did all my study in my dorm room and I got some help from the academic adviser. I had some grinds, but I was mainly looking at the books and teaching myself the Leaving Cert curriculum. “We had a few hiccups along the way. I couldn’t complete the PE project and the Ag Science project because I was an external candidate. At Easter time, I had to pick up business. I had six weeks to learn the whole course, I hadn’t done it for the Junior Cert. For some reason I decided to do higher level but I got a H4 so I’ll take that.” The non-sporting aspects of Quinn’s story also stand out. When he first answered the phone for this article, he apologised for sounding flustered. Quinn had just rushed back from a morning’s work. The NIL money isn’t on its way yet. He works with a child with an intellectual disability, accompanying him on the bus to school. “I sit in the back with him, make sure he puts on his seat belt. I keep him engaged, make sure he doesn’t open doors.” The job came up primarily because of a familiarity with disability. Quinn’s younger brother has 22q, a deletion of DNA on his 22nd chromosome. Aged 10, Andy learned sign language so the pair could communicate. Since gaining some notoriety for his kicking, Quinn has pushed to raise more awareness of the condition. Another brother – there are four young Quinn lads – was previously diagnosed with benign leukaemia. He underwent chemotherapy treatment during the pandemic. Everyone who leaves on the boat grapples with varying degrees of sadness, guilt and early onset homesickness, but for a family which has gone through some hardship, it must be particularly difficult for the eldest child to go. “My grand uncle, he emigrated to America when his youngest brother was 10,” says Quinn. “I was talking to them recently and they said they never really got to know each other that much. It’s on my mind to keep in contact with my brothers, because they are so young. “I spent seven weeks over in America this summer and when I came back, I didn’t tell my younger brothers I was coming. For the first time ever they were happy to see me.” One last question remains. Quinn was on the Junior Cup panel in 2021. He may well have featured in the Senior Cup, a more familiar path to professional sport than an academy in Loughborough. You don’t need to read Ross O’Carroll-Kelly to know that, for schools like this, rugby is everything. Especially if you play 10. “Why did I leave rugby? The opportunity,” says Quinn. “Making any sort of money in American football or rugby is a bit of a long shot anyway, so I thought I’d rather get to see more parts of the world and do something which I really enjoy, which is kicking. “I love kicking footballs. When I played rugby, it was to get the conversion after the try or to get a 50/22. That’s why I played.” Back home in Creggs, there is a stream outside Quinn’s house which represents the border between two counties. “You can’t really say whether I’m from Roscommon or Galway because you’ll offend some people,” he says, again laughing. Winning a Senior Cup or lining out for Connacht may well have sparked an intercounty battle to claim Quinn as their own. Once he’s launching footballs into the Massachusetts sky, and potentially beyond, those debates will linger for a while yet. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Mainfreight was up 80c to $72.30. Photo / File The New Zealand sharemarket was in a cheerful mood in the run-up to Christmas, with Contact Energy having a strong bounce. The S&P/NZX 50 Index fell at the opening but with the Australian counterpart steaming ahead, the index rose strongly and closed at 12,988.03, up 83.92 points or 0.65%. The index has now had a gain of more than 10% this year with four trading days remaining. Volumes were lighter as investors are thinking more about the summer holidays with 27.68 million shares worth $112.98 million changing hands. But there was heavy trading in Ryman Healthcare, down 10c or 2.27% to $4.30, on trade worth $19.38m with two blocks of shares being crossed. A slowdown in price increases prompted a rebound on Wall Street over the weekend. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index – key inflation data for the Federal Reserve - was up 0.1% in November compared with an increase of 0.3% in October, and below the market expectation of 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.18% to 42,840.26 points; the S&P 500 was up 1.09% to 5930.85; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.03% to 19,572.6. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, believes the Magnificent Seven technology stocks will continue to dominate the United States market next year. The artificial intelligence mega forces driving investment will push up Nvidia, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla, which combined make up a third of the S&P 500 market capitalisation. Following the election of US President Donald Trump, there should be less regulation and lower taxes, resulting in higher corporate earnings in a higher growth environment, said BlackRock. But it was cautious about any surge in long-term bond yields and an escalation in trade protectionism. Across the Tasman, the S&P/ASX 200 Index had risen 1.55% to 8192.4 points at 6pm NZ time, no doubt exhilarated by the A$3.4 billion (NZ$3.76b) purchase of Foxtel by the London-based sports streaming platform DAZN. Previous owners News Corp and Telstra will take stakes of 6% and 3% respectively in DAZN, with shareholder loans to Foxtel of A$578m being repaid. Paul Robertshawe, chief investment officer with Octagon Asset Management, said the purchase implied that Sky TV “is pretty cheap and it may prompt talk about someone wanting to buy Sky”. Sky TV, up 8c or 3% to $2.75, has a content-sharing agreement with Foxtel. Robertshaw said the local market had a big finish on Friday and volumes and information flow are now lighter as it heads to the end of the year. Contact, likely to join the MSCI World Index at the expense of Mercury, increased 33c or 3.76% to $9.11. Auckland International Airport gained 17c or 2.05% to $8.47; Spark increased 5.5c or 1.94% to $2.885; Hallenstein Glasson added 10c to a new high of $8.40; and Skellerup was 13c or 2.63% to $5.08. Property stocks Stride rose 5c or 3.97% to $1.31; Argosy was up 2.5c or 2.53% to $1.015; Precinct gained 3c or 2.46% to $1.25; and Goodman Trust added 4c or 2% to $2.04. Mainfreight was up 80c to $72.30; Ebos Group collected 50c to $37.10; Summerset gained 17c to $12.99; Freightways picked up 28c or 2.69% to $10.68; and Scales Corp rose 17c or 4.45% to $3.99. Leading banks had a strong bounce, with ANZ rising $1.59 or 5.3% to $31.60 and Westpac up $1.03 or 2.96% to $35.80. T&G Global rose 5c or 3.33% to $1.55; Allied Farmers increased 4c or 5.33% to 79c; Eroad improved 3c or 3% to $1.03; Green Cross Health was up 3c or 3.75% to 83c; South Port NZ added 10c or 1.9% to $5.36; and Marlin Global gained 3c or 3.3% to 94c. Fisher and Paykel Healthcare was down 18c to $37.77; Chorus declined 18c or 1.99% to $8.85; Gentrack decreased 20c to $12.60; Port of Tauranga shed 19c or 2.86% to $6.45; and Vector was down 9c or 2.28% to $3.86. Delegat Group fell 25c or 4.9% to $4.85; Foley Wines decreased 3c or 5% to 57c; Santana Minerals declined 3c or 5.66% to 50c; and General Capital shed 1.5c or 6% to 23.5c. Fletcher Building, unchanged at $2.80, has appointed James Miller to its board. Miller is chair of Channel Infrastructure and a director of Ryman Healthcare, Mercury Energy and Vista Group. Metro Performance Glass, unchanged at 6.4c, has had the maturity date of its loan facilities extended to the end of July based on the plan that Metro will undertake a capital raise in the June quarter next year. Medicinal cannabis company Greenfern Industries, down 0.001c or 4.76% to 2c, has secured a $200,000 six-month loan from Emdex Limited, providing Greenfern with short-term funding to support its ongoing operations and initiatives.

Title: Compulsion No, Opportunity Yes in the Delaware Law of Externalities

One distinctive feature of the U.S. economy over recent decades has been the rise of the entrepreneur-dominated public company. This development has derived largely from the growth of private funding available through venture capital, so that initial public offerings have commonly served as a “harvesting” moment for the venture capital investors rather than a fund-raising vehicle that would dilute the entrepreneur’s control position. Moreover, the success of the Google IPO in 2004 provided market validation for the entrepreneur’s use of dual class common stock as a way of retaining control while retaining considerably less than 50 percent of the cash flow rights of the public company. The entrepreneur’s “idiosyncratic vision” has also received its celebration in the academic world.[1] We commonly think of corporate law and governance as focused on managerial agency costs, given management’s self-interest and the monitoring challenges faced by diffuse public shareholders. These concerns feature most prominently in the fiduciary duty doctrines that address defensive measures against an unsolicited takeover offer or a control contest through the proxy system. Controlling entrepreneurs present a quite different set of challenges for corporate law and governance. Controllers may limit managerial agency costs, but their self-interest produces so-called controlling shareholder agency costs.[2] Alongside the rise of a new class of controllers has been a fundamental change in capital markets: the rise of portfolio investing, whether through asset managers or self-help portfolio construction, that captures the insight that investors can achieve higher risk-adjusted returns through a strategy of diversification that smooths out firm-specific risk.[3] A specialized financial intermediary, the asset manager, has exploded in significance.[4] These capital market developments came to the Delaware courts this year in a way that produced a series of unusually important cases: In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig.[5] arguably expanded the range of controller-driven transactions that require heightened procedural measures to achieve business judgment rule protection; Tornetta v. Musk[6] looked beyond a bright-line test of equity ownership percentage in deciding whether a CEO had “control;” and W. Palm Beach Fire Fighter’ Pension Fund v. Moelis & Co.[7] held that control-shifting shareholder agreements were inconsistent with board-centric provisions of Delaware law. Moelis was subsequently overruled by legislative amendment.[8] Finally there was McRitchie v. Zuckerberg,[9] holding that a company’s board and officers are not obligated as a matter of fiduciary duty to pursue a strategy that would accommodate the purported interests of the company’s shareholder majority of fully diversified investors (“portfolio investors”) in reducing externalities but rather should pursue a “single firm” or “firm-specific” strategy. This outcome is hardly a surprise, but the broad phrasing of the opinion casts some unwonted shade on the also axiomatic obverse proposition – that a board may, shielded by the business judgment rule, take account of the interests and desires of the dominant portfolio investors in pursuing a business strategy. It is directors’ discretion shielded by the business judgment rule but subject to the legitimating acquiescence of shareholders that is Delaware’s gift to the current debate over corporate behavior. As a bonus, although rejecting compulsion by judicial fiat, the court sketches explicit private-ordering routes under Delaware law to compel management of the firm, as a fiduciary duty matter, in light of the interests of fully diversified investors. The opinion includes a cautionary reflection on the limits of corporate law, at least the law of a single small state, as a lever for the pursuit of pro-social objectives. This is the recent case that I think offers the deepest dive into the possibilities and limits of Delaware corporate law. Compliments must be paid to the cleverness of the McRitchie complaint in two respects. First, it argues that the traditional framing of the directors’ duties in terms of “the corporation and its shareholders” means that at least in cases where the shareholder majority is fully diversified portfolio investors, the directors and officers need to manage by taking account of those shareholders’ portfolio interests. Second, because the directors and officers and controlling shareholder have concentrated investments in the specific firm – here Meta—their interests conflict with the interests of the portfolio investors, and thus they bear the burden of showing “entire fairness” in their chosen strategy. The court rejects plaintiff’s first move as a kind of a pun. “The corporation and its shareholders” necessarily refer to shareholders in the single firm model, and no one would think otherwise, much as a fish has no concept of an environment other than “water.”[10] The court handles plaintiff’s second move with a jujitsu sidestep, arguing that the equity interests held by Zuckerberg, the officers and the directors actually align their interests with their fiduciary duties as seen from the firm-specific perspective. But of course there is a conflict, as there is with virtually every situation of a controller, who directly or indirectly will extract some private benefits of control. A permissible level of private benefit extraction is explicitly and implicitly allowed in the cases. Explicit private benefit extraction is at the core of the seminal case of Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien,[11] in which the Sinclair parent used its control over its partially owned Venezuelan subsidiary Sinven to produce a dividend payout of virtually all Sinven’s profits, which had the effect of denying Sinven the freedom to pursue energy opportunities outside of Venezuela. Because the dividends were paid out pro rata – one share, one dollar – the Delaware Supreme Court held that the dividend payout decision was not “self-dealing” and was subject to permissive business judgment review. By contrast, the cancelling of a contractual obligation owed by Sinclair to Sinven – which would have resulted in disparate pecuniary treatment – was self-dealing and thus triggered “entire fairness” review. It is of course plain that in resolving the conflict of interest between the controller and the public minority shareholders, the court rejected the “firm specific” test. The dividend payout did not maximize Sinven’s value as a public company. Nor as a normative matter should this necessarily trouble us. As Gilson and Gordon (2003) argue, this deviation in favor of the controller reflects an allowable level of private benefits that would compensate the (undiversified) controller for extra risk-bearing while providing a benefit to the public (diversified) shareholders in the control of managerial agency costs.[12] Implicit private benefit extraction is at the core of Mendel v. Carroll.[13] The controlling Carroll family made a take-private proposal for Katy Industries at a price negotiated with the special committee of $25.75 per share, thus presumably triggering the board’s Revlon duty to obtain the highest value for shareholders. Overbidders arrived. The Pensler-Steinhardt group offered $27.80 per share for all shares and asked for an option exercisable at the deal price that would enable it to prevail over the expected opposition of the Carroll family. The Carroll family withdrew its proposal, and the court refused to order the board to grant the dilutive option. Chancellor Allen decided against granting the injunction on the ground that the Carroll family simply valued its control block at more than $25.75 a share. Perhaps the family had private information about the value of the firm, but this presumably would have been elicited in the special committee’s scrutiny of the initial take-private offer. Instead, the family valued the pecuniary and non-pecuniary private benefits of control by more than the offered price.[14] In short, we are far from assuming there is no conflict between controllers and public shareholders just because the controller owns shares. Moreover, validating the controller’s utility function would not necessarily produce the highest value from a firm-specific perspective. [15] Maybe we can put aside the controller cases on the ground that the conflicting shareholder interests in these cases are still about allocation of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements flowing from the specific firm and not about increasing the value of other investments of the controller. But this doesn’t do justice to the objection. Sinclair wanted the dividends from Sinven precisely because it wanted to make investments elsewhere in its portfolio of opportunities. Controllers commonly control dividend payouts (or stock repurchases) with the rest of their portfolio in mind. Thus the controller cases show us that the court is incorrect about the incentive alignment of the controller’s stock ownership and also about the demands of a single-firm approach. But those cases show that the plaintiff is wrong too. The corporate world is filled with cases in which controllers bring a multi-dimensional objective function to the operation of the firm, but those decisions are routinely thought of as presenting business-judgment-rule questions only, assuming no blatant skewing of pecuniary payouts.[16] The court cites many cases of different scenarios that employ specific-firm rhetoric, more obviously prioritizing the interests of shareholders over stakeholders (as in Revlon) but implicitly seeming to rule out consideration of the shareholders’ other investments. As a doctrinal matter, this may be mechanically accurate but functionally wrong. Let’s take the easiest case, the forms of corporate governance. Firms typically adopt governance attributes (e.g., single class board; annual say-on-pay; various board committees and leadership structure) because these are regarded as “best practices” by fully diversified shareholders looking to maximize performance across a portfolio of firms without the costly work that would be required for firm-specific tailoring.[17] Boards commonly acquiesce to such shareholder preferences even when they subjectively believe that alternative arrangements would be superior on a single-firm basis. More fundamentally, firms pick their business strategies to accommodate the interests of shareholders who they know are diversified portfolio investors. This is how I have developed the point previously: We have also accepted without question allowing the risk preferences of diversified investors to shape our theory of optimal firm structure in a way that has firm-specific consequences.[18] Diversification at the portfolio level means that such shareholders disfavor diversification at the firm level, biasing the firm against conglomeration and other diversification measures that may reduce the financial distress risk at the own-firm level and may thus increase costs for the undiversified shareholders. Diversified investors encourage risk taking at the firm level to maximize own-firm expected returns, despite the greater own-firm solvency risks, on the view that this strategy will increase expected returns across the portfolio. As part of this approach to risk, diversified investors push for cash distributions despite the increased own-firm risks. Portfolio investors are not mere kibitzers with talking points; their support is a crucial factor in the success of hedge fund activists who commonly push these strategies on target firms.[19] The say-on-pay mechanism is another vehicle by which portfolio investors promote the pursuit of a particular strategy of maximization. These theoretical understandings do not obligate the directors or officers as a matter of fiduciary duty to follow (or avoid) particular business strategies in their management of the firm, but the observed pattern of M&A activity (including divestitures) shows how directors and officers have chosen to accommodate the objectives of portfolio investors. Inevitably there will be a conflict between the interests of diversified and undiversified investors on this dimension. It turns out that a portfolio approach is embedded at the core of ‘shareholder wealth maximization,” as it is commonly understood, in light of how portfolio theory is critically involved in stock price formation.[20]Modern Portfolio Theory holds that investors are compensated for bearing risk, but only for risk that cannot be diversified away.[21] This is operationalized through specific pricing models like the well-known “Capital Asset Pricing Model” (“CAPM”). Thus market prices of specific securities are set on the assumption that investors are holding such shares in a well-diversified portfolio. Firms trying to “maximize shareholder value” will avoid unrelated diversification, the effect of which may be to reduce own-firm risk but at cost of local inefficiencies in managing a conglomerate enterprise, resulting in a stock price penalty. This follows from a price formation process that assumes idiosyncratic risk can be substantially eliminated through portfolio diversification. More generally, when managers are trying to “maximize shareholder value” for a widely held public company they cannot escape the portfolio structure of share ownership and will almost invariably be acting at the behest of portfolio investors. In short, what may serve the interests of portfolio investors will often disserve the interests of the undiversified. In this important respect, there is no such thing as a “single firm focus.”[22] Rather, at most it is what could be described as a “single firm focus constrained by awareness that the majoritarian shareholders are portfolio investors and their interests are best served by a firm strategy that in significant respects takes that fact into account. But perhaps there is less conflict than one might think between maximizing on a firm-specific basis and taking account of the objective function of portfolio investors. If pricing of the firm’s stock is embedded in Modern Portfolio Theory, then running the firm in accord with the preferences of portfolio investors may well produce the highest stock price. But note, while this might produce the best risk-adjusted returns for the portfolio investor, it will not for the undiversified investor, who may have a substantial investment in the specific firm. So this conclusion follows: The doctrinal framing of the board’s role in terms of a single-firm model casts a veil over how board decisions are commonly made, which takes account of the desires and interests of the firm’s dominant, sometimes controlling but sometimes fully diversified, shareholders. The McRitchie court is plainly correct that a board cannot be compelled, as a matter of Delaware fiduciary law, to take account of the interests of diversified investors in the management of the firm, particularly as regards externalities and even patently obvious systemic externalities such as climate change. But the court’s rhetoric goes too far in its insistence on an exclusively firm-specific focus. Surely the firm can seek to avoid externalities, including the systemic externalities that diversified investors will be keenest to avoid. Delaware fiduciary law does not require profit maximization at the cost of what the board determines are externalities that it wants to avoid. More generally the board has freedom under the umbrella of the business judgment rule, certainly if framed as in consideration of the long term as well as the short term, to take into account the pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests of the actual shareholders of the company. So if the board can consider the interests of the shareholders who are controllers, it ought to be able to consider the interests of the shareholders who are diversified portfolio investors. As noted above, this already occurs. The key question is preserving the legitimacy of directors in taking these actions. This is why the integrity of shareholder voting is critical and must be protected. This has been acknowledged in Delaware, most recently in the striking down of anti-activist pills[23] but also more broadly.[24] At the end of McRitchie v. Zuckerberg, Vice Chancellor Laster plays a trump card in turning down plaintiff’s request for an injunction that would impose affirmative duties on a board and management to reduce externalities. Such a mandatory approach is not sustainable, he says. Objecting corporations and shareholders would simply leave. Delaware corporate law does not provide the lever to force corporations to take what at least some shareholders regard as a more pro-social approach. For scholars of corporate law and governance VC Laster’s final paragraphs on the plaintiff’s claim are sobering: By explicitly rejecting the notion that a board of directors can act loyally when consciously deciding to violate positive law in pursuit of greater profits, Delaware ensures that positive laws and regulations have bite. Through those laws and regulations, governments can impose meaningful restrictions on externalities. Through its corporate law, Delaware supports those efforts. It is frankly difficult for Delaware to use corporate law to do more. Reformers who look to Delaware law to address externalities must acknowledge the larger political environment. Delaware is one of fifty states, each of which can offer entities embodying different corporate law packages. Delaware is not California. Among the fifty states, Delaware has one of the smaller human populations (only around one million souls), one of the smallest geographical areas (albeit conveniently located), and a relatively small economy (though mighty in spirit). Delaware does not have the market power to force anyone to use its corporations, its law, or its courts. Delaware must identify niches where it has a comparative advantage—like corporate law—so that entrepreneurs want to use its corporations, legal practitioners want to choose its law, and parties want to litigate in its courts. Delaware has traditionally filled the corporate law niche by taking a distinctively nonpartisan, technocratic approach. Delaware seeks to supply corporate practitioners with a flexible legal framework, broadly enabling in character but subject to some mandatory floors, that gives managers (framed broadly) expansive discretion to take risks and pursue profit, while at the same time protecting the legitimate rights and expectations of investors. Delaware has not used its corporate law to address hot-button social issues or to intervene in societal debates. Depending on an observer’s political leanings, there are any number of salient issues that Delaware might use its corporate law to address. But to the extent the General Assembly sought to intervene on any of them, entrepreneurs who did not like the answer could incorporate their firms elsewhere. Strong externality regulation is just one example. If the General Assembly sought to make Delaware the externality regulatory for the country (or the world), corporations who did not agree could readily opt out. The lesson is a broader one. State-based corporate law in general, and Delaware law in particular, is a poor vehicle for addressing externalities. Delaware law mandates that its entities and the fiduciaries who manage them comply with positive law. That legal requirement promotes legal compliance in its own right, while also providing a mechanism for holding fiduciaries accountable when they knowingly cause an entity to violate positive law. To ask more from state-based corporate law is to pick the wrong tool for the job.[25] So: “’Delaware law does not charter law breakers,”’[26] and officers and directors may incur liability in a derivative suit if they intentionally violate the law, and, it seems, if they egregiously fail in their oversight duty with respect to compliance. In this way Delaware corporate law sails parallel to the democratic process that enacted these laws. In In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig and in Tornetta v. Musk, we learned that Delaware facilitates shareholder democracy by relying on shareholders to determine the decision rule in a contested fiduciary duty case where, but only where, appropriate disclosure and process have been followed. In McRitchie v. Zuckerberg we learned that the court will honor shareholder decisions to redraw corporate purposes and the board’s duties in the corporation’s foundation documents but will not “blue pencil” those measures through law-like imposition. While Delaware corporate law is not a tool to compel what some might regard as pro-social behavior (other than compliance with law),Delaware would permit directors broad discretion in deciding which externalities to address and to what extent and would treat this permission as subject not to judicial review but to shareholder acquiescence. That leaves ample space for shareholders to petition, for directors to act, and for shareholders, through the processes of corporate democracy, to have the last word.

[10] The irony in the vice chancellor’s citation to David Foster Wallace’s Kenyon Commencement Address, https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/, is that Wallace’s point was to urge his audience to question that which seems so obvious. “[T]he real value of an education … has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness: awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over: ‘This is water.

Assume the target has 100 shares outstanding. Controller owns 50, the public owns 50, the stock trades at $10 per share, based on the company’s expected future cash flows. The controller deems its private benefits are worth $1.50 per share. A prospective bidders believe it can improve the company’s operations by 10 percent and so is prepared to bid up to $11 a share for all shares. The controller refuses, even though the company would, on a cash flow basis, be more valuable after the transaction. [16] The complaint is oddly framed in terms of externalities without any obvious connection to a portfolio investor’s pecuniary interests. It maybe that Meta’s engagement algorithms produce socially harmful behaviors and may spread misinformation that affects elections or disrupts teenage sociability. The impact on the economy and thus the other stocks in the investor’s portfolio is far from clear. There is nothing about the fact of portfolio investing that would necessarily incline such an investor to be more concerned about such harms than an undiversified Meta investor; the reverse seems more likely since the undiversified investor may feel more responsibility for Meta’s conduct.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Heavy Equipment and Industrial Machinery Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (NYSE:MTW) stands against the other heavy equipment and industrial machinery stocks. The industrial heavy equipment market includes machinery and tools used in construction, mining, agriculture, and industrial applications. According to 360iResearch, this sector is critically important for infrastructure development, mining operations, and large-scale agricultural productivity. Growing infrastructural developments, rapid urbanization, and the growth of mining activities are fueling the necessity for heavy equipment. In agriculture, improved machinery efficiency remains critical for meeting global food demands. As per 360iResearch, market growth continues to be influenced by technological advancements like automation, loT integration, and sustainability trends focusing on fuel-efficient and electrically powered machinery. Research Nester believes that the autonomous heavy equipment market was worth more than US$11.43 million in 2024 and should surpass US$26.56 million by 2037. The primary growth driver for the rapid expansion is the strong growth projected in the construction industry. The growth in the building and construction industry is aligned with the demand for heavy equipment. Market experts opine that growth in the construction industry is expected to stem from lower interest rates in 2025. The types of heavy equipment that are used in the construction industry include earthmoving equipment, and material construction industry, among others.

Technological advancements are taking place at a rapid pace, with manufacturers adopting cutting-edge tools and processes to beat the competition. Increased automation and robotics, Al integration, green manufacturing, and 3D printing for customization are the key trends likely to drive growth for the industrial machinery industry in 2025. Automation in industrial machinery tends to reduce the chances of human error and supports streamlining production. Robots, together with machine learning, are being employed to inspect, assemble, and even pack goods. Stumble Forward went on to add that Al-powered systems can predict equipment failures, reducing unexpected costly repairs. This predictive maintenance technology should continue to help industries save thousands of dollars in repair costs. In 2025, industrial machinery is expected to be designed in a way that will promote sustainability. Energy-efficient machines, including those running on renewable energy, or producing less waste, will be adopted. Finally, the adoption of 3D printing in industrial machinery, which can help produce parts that are lightweight yet incredibly strong, is expected to grow as manufacturers continue to realize its importance. Stumble Forward also added that the ability to print intricate designs should result in innovation, enabling engineers to test prototypes and adjust accordingly.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Auto and Truck Dealership Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) stands against the other best auto and truck dealership stocks to invest in. On December 20, Cox Automotive reported that November retail sales figures of used vehicles rose by nearly 2% from October, reaching approximately 1.4 million vehicles. The figure indicated a robust demand as it marks a 13% increase compared to November 2023. Scott Vanner, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive, noted that sales are performing stronger than typical seasonal patterns, which usually see a slowdown due to adverse weather and reduced selling days during the holiday season. The current year has defied these trends with double-digit growth year-over-year. In addition, certified pre-owned vehicle sales also saw a month-over-month increase of 2.7%, rising from 203,272 units in October to an estimated 208,708 units in November 2024. However, on a year-over-year basis, CPO sales were down 3.5%, attributed to fewer available off-lease and trade-in vehicles. READ ALSO: 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Looking ahead to the current month, another report by Cox Automotive expects sales volume for December to be around 1.47 million vehicles, representing a 7.7% increase from the previous month but flat year-over-year. Moreover, December's seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for new-vehicle sales is projected to be 16.5 million, marking an increase from 15.9 million in December 2023 and matching November's figure. Charlie Chesbrough, Cox Automotive’s senior economist in a December 17 report noted that the end of the U.S. election season has contributed to a boost in sales. Buyers are motivated by concerns about upcoming potential policy changes and EV discounts that may not last, leading to a favorable buying environment as 2024 closes. In terms of quarterly and yearly analysis, the fourth quarter is anticipated to finish with a SAAR of 16.4 million, representing a shift to a higher sales pace since October. The report attributes these movements to better inventory levels and increased consumer confidence topped with lower interest rates. On the other hand, full-year new vehicle sales for 2024 are expected to reach approximately 15.85 million units, reflecting a 2.3% increase from the last year. Lastly, the report forecasts that new vehicle sales will continue to grow in 2025, potentially reaching 16.3 million units, driven by ongoing improvements in consumer confidence and favorable market conditions.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) is a major automotive retailer in the United States, primarily involved in selling both new and used vehicles. The company operates through three main segments including Domestic, Imports, and Premium Luxury, selling vehicles ranging from American automakers like General Motors to luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW. In addition to selling vehicles, the company also offers automotive repair and maintenance services and arranges financing for vehicle purchases. AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) faced challenges due to a cyberattack on CDK Global, which is a major software provider for the automotive industry. As a result, its revenue of $6.6 billion decreased 4% year-over-year. The gross profit also took a hit and dropped 9% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, however, the gross profit showed a sequential improvement of +2% led by Customer Financial Services (CFS) and After-Sales growth. Despite the headwinds, management was still able to increase its market share in new vehicle sales, achieving a 2% growth in same-store units across all segments. It also strategically divested eight underperforming stores during the quarter, generating over $150 million in proceeds. This decision was part of a strategy to optimize their portfolio and take advantage of favorable market valuations before they declined. Looking ahead, AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) anticipates improved performance in the fourth quarter, particularly in new vehicle sales. The company is also optimistic about moderating interest rates and plans to leverage capital for acquisitions that promise higher returns for shareholders. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) (down 3.7%) operates around 350 dealer franchises across the US, as well as collision centres and used vehicle stores. When compared to Group 1, it sells more units at a slightly higher price and margin, and derives around 50% more revenue. But its strategy is different, with nationwide branding and centralised operations. Although we prefer the Group 1 model, the economics of Autonation look attractive to us. And by introducing this into the portfolio we could thereby invest more than 5% of assets in this sector without necessitating the sale of other attractive large positions. And so after selling a little Group 1 and buying Autonation we ended the quarter with 4.1% and 1.9% positions respectively.” Overall, AN ranks 5th on our list of best auto and truck dealership stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of the 12 Best Electrical Infrastructure Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against the other best electrical infrastructure stocks to buy according to analysts. The United States is witnessing a notable surge in electricity demand, driven by unprecedented electrification, the rapid expansion of AI-driven data centers, and a resurgence in industrial reshoring and manufacturing. As of September 2024, electricity demand rebounded with a 1.8% increase, reversing a 1.7% decline during the same period in 2023, aided by favorable weather conditions. This uptick signals a sustained period of growth, marking a departure from two decades of stagnant demand and potentially reshaping the electricity landscape in profound ways. According to Deloitte, this demand has spurred a corresponding increase in power generation. By September 2024, utility-scale power generation reached approximately 3,287 billion kWh, reflecting a 3% year-over-year growth. Renewable energy, particularly solar, led the charge, with a 30% increase compared to 13% during the same period in 2023. In that same vein, solar energy is expected to be the fastest-growing energy source by year-end, potentially achieving a 34% growth rate. Moreover, the rapid adoption of digitalization and AI has significantly heightened the demand for data centers across the United States. To keep pace with this adoption, McKinsey projects that data center power requirements might triple by 2030, increasing from 3–4% of the nation’s total electricity demand to approximately 11–12%. This will necessitate a substantial rise in electricity production, signaling a dramatic shift in a country where power demand has remained relatively flat since 2007. By 2030, data centers could account for 30–40% of all net new electricity demand, alongside rising needs from domestic manufacturing, electric vehicles, and electrolyzers. Furthermore, in response to escalating climate-driven disasters and an electricity grid increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable energy, the U.S. is rapidly deploying large-scale battery systems to help prevent power outages. From minimal installations just a few years ago, the country has now added over 20 gigawatts of battery capacity to its electric grid, with 5 GW installed in the first seven months of this year alone, according to the EIA. This rapid expansion is equivalent to adding the output capacity of 20 nuclear reactors to the grid in just four years. The EIA forecasts that this capacity could double to 40 GW by 2025 if planned expansions proceed as expected. On the other hand, transformations in policy, market dynamics, and technological advancements are also driving significant shifts in electricity generation, presenting new challenges for the US electric grid. Much of the country's high-voltage transmission infrastructure dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, leaving it ill-equipped to handle current and future grid demands. Policy changes could further shape the landscape. For instance, Bernstein analysts have highlighted potential risks to electrical infrastructure stocks if the incoming Trump administration repeals the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Such a move, reportedly under consideration as part of broader tax reform, would eliminate a key driver of electrical distribution infrastructure investment. EV charging typically occurs at home, and a growing EV installed base has been a significant catalyst for grid investments. Bernstein estimates that repealing the tax credit would lower electricity demand growth from EVs, reducing the compound annual growth rate from 0.6% to 0.4% over the next five years. To illustrate the potential impact, they pointed to Germany’s rollback of EV subsidies in 2023, which led to a 30% drop in EV-related demand year-to-date in 2024. All things considered, leading electrical infrastructure stocks are poised for substantial gains, supported by the approval of over 46,000 infrastructure projects spanning a wide range of industries, and a monumental $1.2 trillion investment allocated by the U.S. administration.

On December 12, RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating on PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) and maintained a $24 price target, citing the utility’s strong wildfire mitigation and capital investment strategies. PG&E’s wildfire prevention efforts have been particularly effective, with no structures destroyed in its High Fire-Threat Districts (HFTDs) this year, despite a rise in wildfires statewide. The company has also benefited from financial safeguards under AB 1054, with PG&E receiving its first two payments under the program. PG&E’s capital expenditure (capex) plan remains ambitious, with the company accelerating $1 billion into its five-year plan during Q3. Financing for these investments was secured through junior subordinated notes, underscoring the company’s sound financial strategy. Additionally, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) has filed a supplemental request for $3.1 billion in projects for 2025-2026, which is expected to add $2.8 billion to its overall project pipeline. The company’s focus on customer-driven investments aligns with California's legislative initiatives, such as SB 410 and SB 884, and is further supported by a 3.5 GW data center pipeline. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 database, 49 hedge funds held positions in PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), up from 46 funds in the previous quarter. Overall, PCG ranks 4th on our list of best electrical infrastructure stocks to buy according to analysts.

“RFK Jr. is now in all important ways directly accusing Anthony Fauci of mass murder. Fauci, as the lead official in the federal government response to COVID, powerfully incentivized use of Remdesivir, at any stage for people of all ages, early in the “COVID Crisis” by allowing 20% to be added on to the entire Medicare hospital bill. The dangers of Remdesivir were already well-known.” (Prius) On April 29, 2020, six weeks after the declared national “state of emergency,” Fauci announced from the White House that Remdesivir “will be the standard of care” for COVID.” link to Video . . RFK Jr in his book entitled the Real Anthony Fauci documents Fauci’s “30 years of abuse of power, during both the HIV epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic” According to RFK Jr. Tony Fauci knew from the very outset that remdesivir would kill . The Washington Post applauded Anthony Fauci’s announcement (April 29, 2020): “The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony S. Fauci, … fall short of the magic bullet or cure… But with no approved treatments for Covid-19,[Lie] Fauci said, it will become the standard of care for hospitalized patients … The data shows that remdisivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Fauci said. . The deaths resulting fro Remdesevir have been amply documented Remdesivir, which to this day is the primary COVID drug approved for use in U.S. hospitals, routinely causes severe organ damage and, often, death Despite that, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved remdesivir for in-hospital and outpatient use in children as young as 1 month old (Dr. Joseph Mercola, emphasis added) In a 2020 scientific study: (Clinical Microbiology and Infection May 1, 2021.), the researchers assessed the increased risk of bradycardia among COVID-19 patients who were exposed to remdesevir. The analysis included all reports of COVID-19 patients registered until September 23, 2020. The researchers found that among the 2,603 reports of COVID-19 patients prescribed with remdesevir, 302 developed cardiac adverse effects, 94 (or 31%) of which are bradycardia. Of the 94 cases of bradycardia, 80% were serious cases, and 16 were fatal. Compared with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, or glucocorticoids, the use of remdesivir was associated with a higher risk of reporting bradycardia. Download Complete report “A Preemptive Pardon” is a new legal upside down concept put forth by Joe Biden. Its legitimacy has been accepted by the mainstream media. It consists in granting a pardon to individuals who risk at some future date of being accused of crimes they had previously committed. While several names in press reports (including Fauci) (ABC news, December 9, 2024), were mentioned, there is no evidence that Biden has granted a preemptive pardon to Tony Fauci. “Legal experts said Biden can protect people Trump considers his political enemies by issuing them preemptive pardons” No Preemptive Pardon for Fauci… Ooops: No “Preemptive Pardon” for the outgoing President of the United States. Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, December. 22, 2024 Below is Prof. Michel Chossudovsky’s chapter on remdesivir from his eBook, The Worldwide Corona Crisis, Global Coup d’Etat Against Humanity. The text below was first published two months after Fauci’s 29 April 2020 announcement. It confirms that Fauci’s methodology is fraudulent and that Remdesevir is a dangerous drug which has resulted in mortality. *** By Prof. Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, July 5, 2020 There is an ongoing battle to suppress Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a cheap and effective drug for the treatment of Covid-19. The campaign against HCQ is carried out through slanderous political statements, media smears, not to mention an authoritative peer reviewed “evaluation” published on May 22nd by The Lancet, which was based on fake figures and test trials. The study was allegedly based on data analysis of 96,032 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020 from 671 hospitals Worldwide. The database had been fabricated. The objective was to kill the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) cure on behalf of Big Pharma. While The Lancet article was retracted, the media casually blamed “a tiny US based company” named Surgisphere whose employees included “a sci-fi writer and adult content model” for spreading “flawed data” (Guardian). This Chicago based outfit was accused of having misled both the WHO and national governments, inciting them to ban HCQ. None of those trial tests actually took place. . . While the blame was placed on Surgisphere, the unspoken truth (which neither the scientific community nor the media have acknowledged) is that the study was coordinated by Harvard professor Mandeep Mehra under the auspices of Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) which is a partner of the Harvard Medical School. When the scam was revealed, Dr. Mandeep Mehra who holds the Harvey Distinguished Chair of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital apologized: I have always performed my research in accordance with the highest ethical and professional guidelines. However, we can never forget the responsibility we have as researchers to scrupulously ensure that we rely on data sources that adhere to our high standards. It is now clear to me that in my hope to contribute this research during a time of great need, I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions – both directly and indirectly – I am truly sorry. (emphasis added) Mandeep R. Mehra, MD, MSC (official statement on BWH website) But that “truly sorry” note was just the tip of the iceberg. Why? Studies on Gilead Science’s Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Were Conducted Simultaneously by Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) While The Lancet report (May 22, 2020) coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra was intended “to kill” the legitimacy of HCQ as a cure of Covid-19, another important (related) study was being carried out (concurrently) at BWH pertaining to Remdesivir on behalf of Gilead Sciences Inc. Dr. Francisco Marty, a specialist in Infectious Disease and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School was entrusted with coordination of the clinical trial tests of the antiviral medication Remdesivir under Brigham’s contract with Gilead Sciences Inc: Brigham and Women’s Hospital began enrolling patients in two clinical trials for Gilead’s antiviral medication remdesivir. The Brigham is one of multiple clinical trial sites for a Gilead-initiated study of the drug in 600 participants with moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and a Gilead-initiated study of 400 participants with severe COVID-19. … If the results are promising, this could lead to FDA approval, and if they aren’t, it gives us critical information in the fight against COVID-19 and allows us to move on to other therapies.” While Dr. Mandeep Mehra was not directly involved in the Gilead Remdesevir BWH study under the supervision of his colleague Dr. Francisco Marty, he nonetheless had contacts with Gilead Sciences Inc: “He participated in a conference sponsored by Gilead in early April 2020 as part of the Covid-19 debate” (France Soir, May 23, 2020) What was the intent of his (failed) study? To undermine the legitimacy of Hydroxychloroquine? According to France Soir, in a report published after The Lancet Retraction: The often evasive answers produced by Dr Mandeep R. Mehra, … professor at Harvard Medical School, did not produce confidence, fueling doubt instead about the integrity of this retrospective study and its results. (France Soir, June 5, 2020) Was Dr. Mandeep Mehra in conflict of interest? (That is a matter for BWH and the Harvard Medical School to decide upon). Dr. Anthony Fauci, advisor to Donald Trump, portrayed as “America’s top infectious disease expert” has played a key role in smearing the HCQ cure which had been approved years earlier by the CDC as well as providing legitimacy to Gilead’s Remdesivir. Dr. Fauci has been the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since the Reagan administration. He is known to act as a mouthpiece for Big Pharma. Dr. Fauci launched Remdesivir in late June (see details below). According to Fauci, Remdesevir is the “corona wonder drug” developed by Gilead Science Inc. It’s a $1.6 billion dollar bonanza. Gilead Sciences Inc is a Multibillion dollar bio-pharmaceutical company which is now involved in developing and marketing Remdesivir. Gilead has a long history. It has the backing of major investment conglomerates including the Vanguard Group and Capital Research & Management Co, among others. It has developed ties with the US Government. In 1999 Gilead Sciences Inc, developed Tamiflu (used as a treatment of seasonal influenza and bird flu). At the time, Gilead Sciences Inc was headed by Donald Rumsfeld (1997-2001), who later joined the George W. Bush administration as Secretary of Defense (2001-2006). Rumsfeld was responsible for coordinating the illegal and criminal wars on Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Rumsfeld maintained his links to Gilead Sciences Inc throughout his tenure as Secretary of Defense (2001-2006). According to CNN Money (2005): “The prospect of a bird flu outbreak … was very good news for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld [who still owned Gilead stocks] and other politically connected investors in Gilead Sciences”. Anthony Fauci has been in charge of the NIAID since 1984, using his position as “a go between” the US government and Big Pharma. During Rumsfeld’s tenure as Secretary of Defense, the budget allocated to bio-terrorism increased substantially, involving contracts with Big Pharma including Gilead Sciences Inc. Anthony Fauci considered that the money allocated to bio-terrorism in early 2002 would: “accelerate our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of microbes that can be used in attacks, and the biology of the microbes’ hosts — human beings and their immune systems. One result should be more effective vaccines with less toxicity.” (WPo report) In 2008, Dr. Anthony Fauci was granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom by president George W. Bush “for his determined and aggressive efforts to help others live longer and healthier lives.” . . We will be focussing on key documents (and events) Chronology February 21: Initial Release pertaining to NIH-NIAID Remdesivir placebo test trial April 10: The Gilead Sciences Inc study published in the NEJM on the “Compassionate Use of Remdesivir” April 29: NIH Release: Study on Remdesivir (Report published on May 22 in NEJM) May 22: The BWH-Harvard Study on Hydroxychloroquine coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra published in The Lancet May 22: Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, New England Journal of Medicine, (NEJM) June 5: The (fake) Lancet Report (May 22) on HCQ is Retracted. June 29: Fauci announcement. The $1.6 Billion Remdevisir HHS Agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc April 10: The Gilead Sciences Inc. study published in the NEJM on the “Compassionate Use of Remdesivir” A Gilead sponsored report was published in New England Journal of Medicine in an article entitled “Compassionate Use of Remdesivir for Patients with Severe Covid-19”. It was co-authored by an impressive list of 56 distinguished medical doctors and scientists, many of whom were recipients of consulting fees from Gilead Sciences Inc. Gilead Sciences Inc. funded the study which included several staff members as co-authors. . . The testing included a total of 61 patients [who] received at least one dose of remdesivir on or before March 7, 2020; 8 of these patients were excluded because of missing postbaseline information (7 patients) and an erroneous remdesivir start date (1 patient) … Of the 53 remaining patients included in this analysis, 40 (75%) received the full 10-day course of remdesivir, 10 (19%) received 5 to 9 days of treatment, and 3 (6%) fewer than 5 days of treatment. The NEJM article states that “Gilead Sciences Inc began accepting requests from clinicians for compassionate use of remdesivir on January 25, 2020”. From whom, From Where? According to the WHO (January 30, 2020) there were 82 cases in 18 countries outside China of which 5 were in the US, 5 in France and 3 in Canada. Several prominent physicians and scientists have cast doubt on the Compassionate Use of Remdesivir study conducted by Gilead, focussing on the small size of the trial. Ironically, the number of patients in the test is less that the number of co-authors: “53 patients” versus “56 co-authors” Below we provide excerpts of scientific statements on the Gilead NEJM project (Science Media Centre emphasis added) published immediately following the release of the NEJM article: “‘Compassionate use’ is better described as using an unlicensed therapy to treat a patient because there are no other treatments available. Research based on this kind of use should be treated with extreme caution because there is no control group or randomisation, which are some of the hallmarks of good practice in clinical trials. Prof Duncan Richard, Clinical Therapeutics, University of Oxford. “It is critical not to over-interpret this study. Most importantly, it is impossible to know the outcome for this relatively small group of patients had they not received remdesivir. Dr Stephen Griffin, Associate Professor, School of Medicine, University of Leeds. “The research is interesting but doesn’t prove anything at this point: the data are from a small and uncontrolled study. Simon Maxwell, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology and Prescribing, University of Edinburgh. “The data from this paper are almost uninterpretable. It is very surprising, perhaps even unethical, that the New England Journal of Medicine has published it. It would be more appropriate to publish the data on the website of the pharmaceutical company that has sponsored and written up the study. At least Gilead have been clear that this has not been done in the way that a high quality scientific paper would be written. Prof Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “It’s very hard to draw useful conclusions from uncontrolled studies like this particularly with a new disease where we really don’t know what to expect and with wide variations in outcomes between places and over time. One really has to question the ethics of failing to do randomisation – this study really represents more than anything else, a missed opportunity.” Prof Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Bristol.

On April 29th following the publication of the Gilead Sciences Inc Study in the NEJM on April 10, a press release of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on Remdevisir was released. The full document was published on May 22, by the NEJM under the title: Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report (NEJM) The study had been initiated on February 21, 2020. The title of the April 29 Press Release was: “Peer-reviewed data shows remdesivir for COVID-19 improves time to recovery” It’s a government sponsored report which includes preliminary data from a randomized trial involving 1063 hospitalized patients. The results of the trial labelled Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) are preliminary, conducted under the helm of Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID): An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the trial met on April 27 to review data and shared their interim analysis with the study team. Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery, a metric often used in influenza trials. Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level. Preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p<0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. Results also suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (p=0.059). (emphasis added) In the NIH’s earlier February 21, 2020 report (released at the outset of the study), the methodology was described as follows: … A randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) … The February 21 report confirmed that the first trial participant was “an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship” that docked in Yokohama (Japanese Territorial Waters). “Thirteen people repatriated by the U.S. State Department from the Diamond Princess cruise ship” were selected as patients for the placebo trial test. Ironically, at the outset of the study, 58.7% of the “confirmed cases” Worldwide (542 cases out of 924) (outside China), were on the Diamond Cruise Princess from which the initial trial placebo patients were selected. Where and When: The trial test in the 68 selected sites? That came at a later date because on February 19th (WHO data), the US had recorded only 15 positive cases (see Table Below). “A total of 68 sites ultimately joined the study—47 in the United States and 21 in countries in Europe and Asia.” (emphasis added) In the final May 22 NEJM report entitled Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report: There were 60 trial sites and 13 subsites in the United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1). Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo. Randomization was stratified by study site and disease severity at enrollment The Washington Post applauded Anthony Fauci’s announcement (April 29): “The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony S. Fauci, … fall short of the magic bullet or cure… But with no approved treatments for Covid-19,[Lie] Fauci said, it will become the standard of care for hospitalized patients …The data shows that remdisivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Fauci said. . . The government’s first rigorous clinical trial of the experimental drug remdesivir as a coronavirus treatment delivered mixed results to the medical community Wednesday — but rallied stock markets and raised hopes that an early weapon to help some patients was at hand. The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony Fauci, chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which led the placebo-controlled trial found that the drug accelerated the recovery of hospitalized patients but had only a marginal benefit in the rate of death. … Fauci’s remarks boosted speculation that the Food and Drug Administration would seek emergency use authorization that would permit doctors to prescribe the drug. In addition to clinical trials, remdesivir has been given to more than 1,000 patients under compassionate use. [also refers to the Gilead study published on April 10 in the NEJM] The study, involving [more than] 1,000 patients at 68 sites in the United States and around the world (??), offers the first evidence (??) from a large (??), randomized (??) clinical study of remdesivir’s effectiveness against COVID-19. The NIH placebo test study provided “preliminary results”. While the placebo trial test was “randomized”, the overall selection of patients at the 68 sites was not fully randomized. See the full report. May 22: The Fake Lancet Report on Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) It is worth noting that the full report of the NIH-NIAID) entitled Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report was released on May 22, 2020 in the NEJM, on the same day as the controversial Lancet report on Hydroxychloroquine. Immediately folllowing its publication, the media went into high gear, smearing the HCQ cure, while applauding the NIH-NIASD report released on the same day. Remdesivir, the only drug cleared to treat Covid-19, sped the recovery time of patients with the disease, … “It’s a very safe and effective drug,” said Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. “We now have a definite first efficacious drug for Covid-19, which is a major step forward and will be built upon with other drugs, [and drug] combinations.” When the Lancet HCQ article by Bingham-Harvard was retracted on June 5, it was too late, it received minimal media coverage. Despite the Retraction, the HCQ cure “had been killed”. June 29: Fauci Greenlight. The $1.6 Billion Remdesivir Contract with Gilead Sciences Inc Dr. Anthony Fauci granted the “Greenlight” to Gilead Sciences Inc. on June 29, 2020. The semi-official US government NIH-NIAID sponsored report (May 22) entitled Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report (NEJM) was used to justify a major agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc. The Report was largely funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). On June 29, based on the findings of the NIH-NIAID Report published in the NEJM, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on behalf of the Trump Adminstration an agreement to secure large supplies of the remdesivir drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. for the treatment of Covid-19 in America’s private hospitals and clinics. The earlier Gilead study based on scanty test results published in the NEJM (April 10), of 53 cases (and 56 co-authors) was not highlighted. The results of this study had been questioned by several prominent physicians and scientists. Who will be able to afford Remdisivir? 500,000 doses of Remdesivir are envisaged at $3,200 per patient, namely $1.6 billion (see the study by Elizabeth Woodworth) The Drug was also approved for marketing in the European Union. under the brandname Veklury. If this contract is implemented as planned, it represents for Gilead Science Inc. and the recipient US private hospitals and clinics a colossal amount of money. . . [Error in above title according to HHS: $3200] According to The Trump Administration’s HHS Secretary Alex Azar (June 29, 2020): “To the extent possible, we want to ensure that any American patient who needs remdesivir can get it. [at $3200] The Trump Administration is doing everything in our power to learn more about life-saving therapeutics for COVID-19 and secure access to these options for the American people.” Careful timing: The Lancet study (published on May 22) was intended to undermine the legitimacy of Hydroxychloroquine as an effective cure to Covid-19, with a view to sustaining the $1.6 billion agreement between the HHS and Gilead Sciences Inc. on June 29th. The legitmacy of this agreement rested on the May 22 NIH-NIAID study in the NEJM which was considered “preliminary”. What Dr. Fauci failed to acknowledge is that Chloroquine had been “studied” and tested fifteen years ago by the CDC as a drug to be used against coronavirus infections. And that Hydroxychloroquine has been used recently in the treatment of Covid-19 in several countries. According to the Virology Journal (2005) “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread”. It was used in the SARS-1 outbreak in 2002. It had the endorsement of the CDC. . . HCQ is not only effective, it is “inexpensive” when compared to Remdesivir, at an estimated “$3120 for a US Patient with private insurance”. Below are excerpts of an interview of Harvard’s Professor Mehra (who undertook the May 22 Lancet study) with France Soir published immediately following the publication of the Lancet report (prior to its Retraction). Dr. Mandeep Mehra: In our study, it is fairly obvious that the lack of benefit and the risk of toxicity observed for hydroxychloroquine are fairly reliable. [referring to the May 22 Lancet study] France Soir: Do you have the data for Remdesivir? MM: Yes, we have the data, but the number of patients is too small for us to be able to conclude in one way or another. FS: As you know, in France, there is a pros and cons battle over hydroxychloroquine which has turned into a public health issue even involving the financial lobbying of pharmaceutical companies. Why not measure the effect of one against the other to put an end to all speculation? … MM: In fact, there is no rational basis for testing Remdesivir versus hydroxychloroquine. On the one hand, Remdesivir has shown that there is no risk of mortality and that there is a reduction in recovery time. On the other hand, for hydroxychloroquine it is the opposite: it has never been shown any advantage and most studies are small or inconclusive In addition, our study shows that there are harmful effects. It would therefore be difficult and probably unethical to compare a drug with demonstrated harmfulness to a drug with at least a glimmer of hope. FS: You said that there is no basis for testing or comparing Remdesivir with hydroxychloroquine, do you think you have done everything to conclude that hydroxychloroquine is dangerous? MM: Exactly. … All we are saying is that once you have been infected (5 to 7 days after) to the point of having to be hospitalized with a severe viral load, the use of hydroxychloroquine and its derivative is not effective. The damage from the virus is already there and the situation is beyond repair. With this treatment [HCQ] it can generate more complications FS Mandeep Mehra declared that he had no conflict of interest with the laboratories and that this study was financed from the endowment funds of the professor’s chair. He participated in a conference sponsored by Gilead in early April 2020 as part of the Covid-19 debate. (France Soir, translated by the author, emphasis added, May 23, 2020) In Annex, see the followup article by France Soir published after the scam surrounding the data base of Dr. Mehra’s Lancet report was revealed. Lies and Corruption to the nth Degree involving Dr. Anthony Fauci, “The Boston Connection” and Gilead Sciences Inc. The Gilead Sciences Inc. Remdesivir study (50+ authors) was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (April 10, 2020). It was followed by the NIH-NIAID Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report on May 22, 2020 in the NEJM. And on that same day, May 22, the “fake report” on Hydroxychloroquine by BWH-Harvard Dr. Mehra was published by The Lancet. Harvard Medical School and the BWH bear responsibility for having hosted and financed the fake Lancet report on HCQ coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra. Is there conflict of interest? BWH was simultaneously involved in a study on Remdesivir in contract with Gilead Sciences, Inc. While the Lancet report coordinated by Harvard’s Dr. Mehra was retracted, it nonetheless served the interests of Gilead Sciences Inc. It is important that an independent scientific and medical assessment be undertaken, respectively of the Gilead Sciences Inc New England Journal of Medicine (NEMJ) peer reviewed study (April 10, 2020) as well as the NIH-NIAID study also published in the NEJM (May 22, 2020). The fraud concerning the Lancet Report was revealed in early June. France Soir in a subsequent article (June 5, 2020) points to the Boston Connection: La connexion de Boston, namely the insiduous relationship between Gilead Sciences Inc and Professor Mehra, Harvard Medical School as well as the two related Boston based hospitals involved. . . (Excerpts here, to access the complete text click here translation from French by France Soir, emphasis in the original article) The often evasive answers produced by Dr Mandeep R. Mehra, a physician specializing in cardiovascular surgery and professor at Harvard Medical School, did not produce confidence, fueling doubt instead about the integrity of this retrospective study and its results. … However, the reported information that Dr. Mehra had attended a conference sponsored by Gilead – producer of remdesivir, a drug in direct competition with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) – early in April called for further investigation It is important to keep in mind that Dr. Mandeep Mehra has a practice at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in Boston. That study relied on the shared medical records of 8,910 patients in 169 hospitals around the world, also by Surgisphere. Funding for the study was “Supported by the William Harvey Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The development and maintenance of the collaborative surgical outcomes database was funded by Surgisphere.” The study published on May 22 sought to evaluate the efficacy or otherwise of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with a macrolide antibiotic. … It is therefore noteworthy that within 3 weeks, 2 large observational retrospective studies on large populations – 96,032 and 8,910 patients – spread around the world were published in two different journals by Dr. Mehra, Dr. Desai and other co-authors using the database of Surgisphere, Dr. Desai’s company. These two practising physicians and surgeons seem to have an exceptional working capacity associated with the gift of ubiquity. The date of May 22 is also noteworthy because on the very same day, the date of the publication in The Lancet of the highly accusatory study against HCQ, another study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine concerning the results of a clinical trial of…remdesivir. In the conclusion of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, “remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.” Concretely: on the same day, May 22nd, one study demeaned HCQ in one journal while another claimed evidence of attenuation on some patients through remdesivir in another journal. It should be noted that one of the main co-authors, Elizabeth “Libby”* Hohmann, represents one of the participating hospitals, the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, also affiliated with Harvard Medical School, as is the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, where Dr. Mandeep Mehra practices. Coincidence, probably. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the first 3 major clinical trials on Gilead’s remdesivir were conducted by these two hospitals: “While COVID-19 continues to circle the globe with scientists following on its trail, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) are leading the search for effective treatment. “Both hospitals are conducting clinical trials of remdesivir.” MGH has joined what the National Institute of Health (NIH) describe as the first clinical trial in the United States of an experimental treatment for COVID-19, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of NIH. MGH is currently the only hospital in New England to participate in this trial, according to a list of sites shared by the hospital. ” It’s a gigantic undertaking, with patients registered in some 50 sites across the country, getting better. “The NIH trial, which can be adapted to evaluate other treatments, aims to determine whether the drug relieves the respiratory problems and other symptoms of COVID-19, helping patients leave hospital earlier.** As a reminder, the NIAID/NIH is led by Antony Fauci, a staunch opponent of HCQ. Coincidence, probably. “At the Brigham, two additional trials initiated by Gilead, the drug developer, will determine whether it alleviates symptoms in patients with moderate to severe illness over five- and ten-days courses. These trials will also be randomized, but not placebo controlled, and will include 1,000 patients at sites worldwide. Those patients, noted Francisco Marty, MD, Brigham physician and study co-investigator, will likely be recruited at an unsettlingly rapid clip.” As a result, the first major clinical trials on remdesivir launched on March 20, whose results are highly important for Gilead, are being led by the MGH and BWH in Boston, precisely where Dr. Mehra, the main author of the May 22nd HCQ trial, is practising. Small world! Coincidence, again, probably. Dr. Marty at BWH expected to have results two months later. Indeed, in recent days, several US media outlets have reported Gilead’s announcements of positive results from the remdesivir clinical trials in Boston.: “Encouraging results from a new study published Wednesday on remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.** Brigham and Dr. Francisco Marty worked on this study, and he says the results show that there is no major difference between treating a patient with a five-day versus a 10-day regimen. …”Gilead Announces Results of Phase 3 Remdesivir Trial in Patients with Moderate COVID-19 – One study shows that the 5-day treatment of remdesivir resulted in significantly greater clinical improvement compared to treatment with the standard of care alone – The data come on top of the body of evidence from previous studies demonstrating the benefits of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with IDVOC-19 “We now have three randomized controlled trials demonstrating that remdesivir improved clinical outcomes by several different measures,” Gilead plans to submit the complete data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. These results announced by Gilead a few days after the May 22 publication of the study in the Lancet demolishing HCQ, a study whose main author is Dr. Mehra, are probably again a coincidence.

Global Research’s Holiday Fundraiser by Michel Chossudovsky Michel Chossudovsky reviews in detail how this insidious project “destroys people’s lives”. He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the “pandemic” — from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. “My objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the “deadly” COVID-19 “vaccine”. This crisis affects humanity in its entirety: almost 8 billion people. We stand in solidarity with our fellow human beings and our children worldwide. Truth is a powerful instrument.” Reviews This is an in-depth resource of great interest if it is the wider perspective you are motivated to understand a little better, the author is very knowledgeable about geopolitics and this comes out in the way Covid is contextualized. —Dr. Mike Yeadon In this war against humanity in which we find ourselves, in this singular, irregular and massive assault against liberty and the goodness of people, Chossudovsky’s book is a rock upon which to sustain our fight. –Dr. Emanuel Garcia In fifteen concise science-based chapters, Michel traces the false covid pandemic, explaining how a PCR test, producing up to 97% proven false positives, combined with a relentless 24/7 fear campaign, was able to create a worldwide panic-laden “plandemic”; that this plandemic would never have been possible without the infamous DNA-modifying Polymerase Chain Reaction test – which to this day is being pushed on a majority of innocent people who have no clue. His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. —Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that “there is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.” In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. –David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky’s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d’état under way called “The Great Reset” that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined.

Don Harrision Sign Up To Receive Regular Heart of Liberty Bulletins Here The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. Isaiah 11:6 The book of Isaiah, written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, prophesies a utopia where all natural enmities disappear and predators and prey become as one and take the same sustenance. It is understandable that the Israelites of the time, oppressed by Assyrians and Babylonians, would long for a peaceable kingdom. Today, however, it is less understandable – in fact downright baffling — that investment managers who pride themselves on their rationality seem to believe that we live in a world in which physics and economics have gone with the wind, and the lions in their portfolios can prosper on a diet of straw. The conceit I am referring to concerns the voracious lions of artificial intelligence (AI) and the utopian dream of decarbonization. The AI revolution needs the red meat of reliable power – in science-fiction-like quantities – while the decarb dreamers’ windmills and solar panels can deliver only unsatisfying amounts of marginally nutritious straw. Many investment managers own shares of AI leaders[1] such as Nvidia while simultaneously professing a commitment to net zero CO2. This is portfolio management animated more by blind faith than by proven, analytical process. Investors would be wise to question whether they wish to invest with organizations which seem almost willfully ignorant of the performance-sapping implications of this conflicted approach. AI Power Needs — AI’s bottomless appetite for power is no secret. Google “AI need for power” and you will find that banks, corporations, NGO’s, think tanks and major publications are all on the case: These examples are just the tip of the AI power-requirement iceberg. Investment Companies Are Aware of AI’s Power Appetite — Investment management organizations that own AI leaders[8] are certainly cognizant of this coming tidal wave of energy demand: Unlike those whom Jesus’ castigated in the Gospel of Matthew[13]forhaving eyes but refusing to see, these firms understand AI’s growing hunger for electricity. Renewable Inconstancy — It is also no secret that the net-zero utopians’ favorite power sources – wind and solar – are unreliable. In fact, an understanding of the capricious nature of the wind and the effect of clouds on sunshine is so ingrained in our experience that generative AI, whose “intelligence” is fueled by millennia of human poetry and prose, can churn out an endless stream of cliches on the subject such as “love as fleeting as the fickle summer wind” and “troubles like a veil of clouds.” Academics, not satisfied with machine-made similes derived from common knowledge, have felt the need to conduct studies to prove that wind and solar “are inherently highly variable due to volatile weather conditions.”[14] And if age-old wisdom and academic elucidation of the obvious leave any doubt about renewable instability, the UK and Germany have been kind enough to erase it by inadvertently conducting nationwide demonstration projects. These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.[15] In early November of this year, both countries experienced what the Germans call Dunkelflaute (dark doldrums), which arises when high-pressure systems diminish wind and thicken clouds.[16] In the UK, this meant its wind farms were able to meet just 3-4% of the countries’ electricity demand, and in Germany theirs operated at only 7% of capacity.[17] Of course, grid operators had to call on natural gas and coal to step into the breach.[18] Charles Rotter at Watts Up With That? has pointed out that a proposed solution from the UK’s National Energy System Operator to this regular winter issue is “system flexibility”[19] — bureaucratize for public rationing and adjustment of energy usage based on availability. Cooking your dinner early or reading that bedtime novel at 2 pm in anticipation of a calm evening may seem trivial sacrifices to make for the greater good of saving Gaia, but imagine a world in which Dunkelflaute starves a power-hungry AI tasked with the 24/7 running of cybersecurity, healthcare and energy transmission: millions of credit cards compromised by foreign actors, AI-enabled robotic surgeons unable to perform life-saving operations, and the ironic last straw — the meager amount of power being generated by these renewables dies on the vine because the grid is managed by AI. We can’t trust AI with vital, economy-wide duties if it has to rely on gentle breezes and occluded sunshine. Investment Companies Are Aware of Renewable Shortcomings— The research teams at AI-invested portfolio managers are just as aware of renewables’ innate limitations as they are of AI’s appetite for electricity: Inconsistency, variability, intermittency. These investment companies’ analyses of the dependability of wind and solar read like indictments drawn up by Roget’s Thesaurus. Batteries on White Horses — Of course, no investment organizations believe that we can achieve a net zero future that still enables AI with wind and solar alone; as Blackrock has pointed out, these are only a half solution.[24] Continuous dispatchability requires grid-level battery storage. Clearbridge thinks batteries will be an integral part of a renewable infrastructure industry that will achieve compound annual growth rates of 10-30% for the next 30 years.[25] JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Blackrock have all put their money where their mouths are, investing billions in battery storage companies such as Strata Clean Energy, Gridstor, Eku Energy and Waratah.[26] These investment firms are heeding the call of the International Energy Agency (IEA),[27] one of the high priests of net zero. For the IAE, grid-level battery storage will ride to renewables’ rescue like a green savior on Revelations’ white horse,[28] and alchemize the benign but capricious production of turbines and solar panels into ever-dispatchable abundance. Straw Batteries — But how likely is it that battery storage will be renewable’s salvation, and provide the inexpensive, always-on power needed to sustain the AI industry? Mark Mills is a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a contributing editor at City Journal, a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick school of engineering, director of the National Center for Energy Analytics, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of numerous books and articles on energy and digital technology.[29] I have corresponded with Mark and followed his work for almost 25 years and have found him to be insightful, perspicacious and refreshingly thorough on every subject he turns his mind to. In a rare moment of agreement between Bill Gates and myself, Gates has said that Mark’s book The Bottomless Well “is the only book I’ve ever seen that really explains energy.”[30] In testimony before the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Mark had this to say about grid-level battery storage:[31] Given the almost unfathomable cost and scale of material production required for sufficient grid-level batteries, in all likelihood they are not the magic that will transform wind and solar into the robust energy source AI demands. The Last Straw — This past April, a Wall St. Journal piece explored a seemingly redemptive paradox embedded in the nature of AI: at first glance it looks to explode power usage, but at the same time it holds out the promise that it can increase energy efficiency and thereby reduce consumption.[32] The article focuses on savings in real estate, but the alleged potential is economy-wide. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser believes efficiency gains over the past 15 years – before the advent of AI – have reduced energy demand by the equivalent of 90 million barrels of oil a day.[33] If smart thermostats, electronic sensors in fuel injectors and other relatively crude enhancements have produced this remarkable accomplishment, imagine what the coming AI revolution can achieve through predictive consumption forecasting, renewable energy integration, intelligent grid management and other currently undreamed of wonders! But does Mr. Nasser’s observation about reduced energy demand mean that the world has reduced its energy consumption over the past 15 years? Not according to Our World in Data, which shows overall energy consumption growing by 20% during this period:[34] These last 15 years continue a consistent post-war phenomena: no matter how much we increase vehicle mpg and no matter how many Thermopane windows we install, humanity unfailingly and mysteriously gobbles ever more energy. Only recessions induce power dieting (gold arrows). So is the Saudi Aramco CEO a liar or an ignoramus, or perhaps nefariously spinning the facts to benefit the oil industry? The answer is probably not – on all 3 counts. Most likely, he is referring to efficiency gains in isolation, and neglecting the further consequences of those efficiencies. More energy saving devices and processes would reduce energy consumption if all things remained equal, but we live in a dynamic world where changing inputs leads to unexpected outputs. Imagine in a previous life that you were a blacksmith who specializes in iron plow shares. You’re a brilliant fellow, and you devise a method that burns less wood to generate the heat needed to forge and shape the iron. You subsequently reduce your prices, which means poorer peasants can now afford your plowshares. This leads to more land under cultivation, which creates a burgeoning population, which ignites an ever-greater consumption of the wood needed to meet this expanding market that you and thousands of other imitative smiths are now servicing. And which – depending on your perspective – makes God’s green earth a little more paradisiacal for you and your fellow man, or eventually transforms it into a Boschian hellhole pocked by the pustules of oil derricks, coal mines and fracking and uranium waste. But no matter which way you look at it, your fuel-efficient advancement in metal-working most surely does not reduce energy consumption. All of which leads us to the real paradox regarding AI and power: Jevon’s Paradox. William Stanley Jevons was a British economist who first described this phenomenon in a paper in 1865. It is now so widely known and so well documented that Google’s generative AI app has a synopsis, but I prefer the human insight of Mark Mills: AI will create fuel-usage efficiencies, but it will in turn undoubtedly lead to increased consumption. The Saudi Aramco exec was probably not trying to hoodwink us. As radio host Paul Harvey would have put it, he just didn’t consider “the rest of the story.” Perversely, one man’s energy diet plan begets mankind’s need for an energy feast. Let Them Eat Straw — In spite of their awareness of both AI power requirements and of the fickle nature of wind and solar, in spite of the well-publicized issues with grid-level battery storage, and in spite of the widespread knowledge of Jevon’s Paradox and its implications for the notion that AI-effectuated efficiencies will reduce energy consumption, many investment management organizations continue to demonstrate a deep commitment to a net-zero future and to its proponent organizations: In the investment management community, Clearbridge’s membership in a climate-change organization that promotes decarbonization through wind and solar is not an anomaly. PRI, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, Ceres Investor Network and Climate Action 100+ are 5 of the most prominent of these initiatives. Of the 10 largest fund companies, 9 are signatories to at least one of them, and collectively they hold 31 memberships.[42] Blackrock is a member of four of these outfits, and Blackrock International belongs to the fifth.[43] Blackrock’s Chairman Larry Fink, in a Wall St. Journal op-ed,[44] has called for a capital spending boom to build an “AI transcontinental railroad” that will juice U.S. real economic growth to 3% and increase tax revenues, thereby helping to mitigate the national debt crisis. But nowhere in this article does Mr. Fink mention that his company funds outfits who long to starve the railroad’s engines of fuel. Investment managers’ devotion to decarbonization also manifests itself in their proxy voting records. Each year, Pension Politics analyzes the proxy voting record of investment management companies, based on their votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[45] These are 50 of the most extreme ESG-oriented proposals, 27 of which in 2023 were climate related. These proposals not only require companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree target, but to report on how their lobbying, insuring and investing activities, and their involvement in trade associations and other alliances, promote decarbonization.[46] At first glance, these proposals appear to be the grassroots efforts of a diverse group of shareholders who are agnostic on the means of achieving net zero (“the strategy on how to achieve this target is entirely up to the Board”).[47] But in fact they are the handiwork of a small number of progressive non-profits such as Green America, As You Sow and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, all of whom are crusaders for wind and solar.[48] Green America does not try to hide its absolutist advocacy of these so-called renewables: “it is critical to the future of the planet that society moves away from all carbon-producing sources of energy and invests heavily in renewables such as wind, solar, geothermal, and second-generation biofuels.”[49] The other organizations appear to be making a conscious effort to obscure their belief in the role that wind and solar will need to play in the descent to net zero. They use fuzzy, feel-good language, but there can be little doubt that they believe a “just transition to a green economy,” the “phase in of low-carbon energy resources,”[50] and an “equitable energy future” will require an abundance of wind and solar, as evidenced by the many pictures of solar panels and windmills that adorn their web sites.[51] Of the 820 investment outfits Pension Politics graded this year, 520 received a D or F for their proxy votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[52] A major contributing factor to these firms’ poor grades was their collusion with these obscure, radical climate-change zealots to force corporate America to decarbonize. Supposedly the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, when told that her starving peasants had no bread, advised them to eat cake. Though there is no historical evidence that she said this, today there is ample evidence that many investment management organizations, through their support of decarbonization and its handmaidens, are effectively telling the AI lions in their portfolios to eat straw. A Schizophrenic Vision — All investing involves a vision of the future. That vision may originate from a top-down analysis of the economy in which a portfolio manager buys REITs because money supply growth has recently abated, creating the conditions for a snowballing beneficence: inflation will drop, the Fed will lower rates, REIT interest costs will decline, their earnings will increase and their stock prices will climb. Or it may start with a more humble, bottom-up approach: a second manager buys XYZ company because its new CEO will soon jettison the money-losing companies purchased by his profligate predecessor, and return XYZ to its profitable roots. In either case, each of them has envisioned a future friendly to particular stocks or industries, and positioned their portfolios accordingly. But imagine if the first manager buys REITs because of the scenario outlined above, and then pens an opinion piece in the Wall St. Journal urging the Federal Reserve not to lower rates because that will increase inflation. Or if number two buys XYZ and tries to talk the new CEO into maintaining his predecessor’s legacy. A Freudian would call this schizophrenia, while a Christian might invoke the Gospel of Mark to warn that portfolio management divided against itself cannot stand, but they would both probably agree that this is a bizarre, contrary, unworkable approach to making money. The promotion of renewables by AI-owning investment firms is similarly confused. Either AI thrives in a world powered by the proven, reliable bounty of fossil fuels and nuclear fission, or it starves on wind, solar and wishful thinking. In addition — though the full exploration of this is a topic for another day — a decarbonized economy will suffer from low productivity and anemic growth because of renewables’ inefficiency and lack of energy density. This means that nationwide economic growth — the wind at the backs of all companies – will experience its own Dunkelflaute, enfeebling the returns of every investor and every investment organization, not just those that own AI stocks. AI giants such as Microsoft and Google still publicly cling to the hope that they will be carbon-neutral by 2030, in spite of the recent AI-driven upwelling in their consumption of traditional energy. Analysts who see things in the harsh light of day, however, call this dream “ridiculous.”[53] It is high time that the investment management organizations that own these AI operating companies come to this same clear-eyed understanding, and clarify the conflicted vision that shapes their portfolios. They need to either divest themselves of AI or cease to worship at the altar of net-zero. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind.

Type your email… Subscribe Unlike Mr Harrison, policymakers, investors and data center owners (including anyone with any education) are aware of the importance of eliminating CO2 emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear energy Oh, I see- only stupid people prefer fossil fuels and voted for Trump. I see that attitude all the time, especially here in elitist Wokeachusetts. No nukes here, though- they’ve all been shut down. I said anyone with an education knows about climate change and its solutions. If you know about nuclear, then you know about one important solution. You meant , “any person with an indoctrination”… blah, blah Come on, In what way have humans change global climate change that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? You also need to provide empirical scientific evidence that CO2 has any measurable warming effect. But you will fail again, as you always do. That means you are yapping an ideology you have no evidence for. Religions and cults work that way. There is NO CLIMATE PROBLEM, certainly not from fossil fuels. So no “solution” is required. Nuclear is possible future major energy supply.. Wind and solar are nothing but a parasitic fad. There is absolutely zero need to eliminate CO2 emissions. That is a fallacy which has been brain-washed into gullible twits. CO2 is ALL benefit, no downside. It feeds plant life hence feeds all creatures on the planet. Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming. Fossil fuels have raised modern civilisations and will continue to be a very major source of energy for a long time to come, they cannot be dispensed with if civilisations want to continue to exist. Wind and solar are just a fake parasitic measure to combat a fake anti-CO2 agenda, and are actually one of the most polluting forms of energy over their short life-cycle. “Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming.” _______________________________________________________________________ Oh they might do that, but then they have to say why ﻿warming is a problem which it isn’t. See #2 on the list: 1. More rain is not a problem. 2. Warmer weather is not a problem. 3. More arable land is not a problem. 4. Longer growing seasons is not a problem. 5. CO2 greening of the earth is not a problem. 6. There isn’t any Climate Crisis. I have searched. I have asked many people to help find that evidence.. … but still, nada, zip.. nothing !! Since you can’t read, think, or speak rationally, I like your posts because there is nothing of substance I have to bother with! As expected… still, nada, zip.. nothing !! … In what way have humans changed the global climate that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? Produce EVIDENCE !!…… or not 😉 That’s rather rich coming from a moron like you! Please specify which of the geologic epochs have lower temperatures and CO2 levels than the Holocene, and just how you propose to prevent the death of ALL LIFE ON EARTH from CO2 starvation during a glacial expansion sometime in the next 1,000,000 years! Your ability to regurgitate corporate propaganda is only exceeded by your ignorance! And you are contradicted by all scientific research worldwide when you claim ‘climate change isn’t a problem’. Read any of the scientific reports from the NAS, the Royal Society, or NASA here: https://climate.nasa.gov The Royal Society? Nullius in verba. Especially them. Sorry, anyone that posts fraudulent graphs as you just have and rejects mainstream science from the National Science Academies, has no credibility with me. Footnote: ‘Present’ on your graph is 1950 by scientific convention, so your graph omits modern era warming from 1950 onward — which is most of it. If you knew that, you are a fraud. Why should anyone care if you think someone else is credible? Self induce Dunning-Kruger effect. You are a nobody, a scientific non-entity. Oooh get you. What’s your title? The central scrutiniser? The supreme arbiter? anyone that posts the nonsense you post is up for the ridicule you so richly deserve. I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. Why would we think you have any credibility? The oceans have ~1,000 X the heat content of the atmosphere, and contain ~60 X the CO2; yet you still believe that a small increase in atmospheric CO2 away from the death threshold for all plant life is of major concern!? Hunh!? You really should avoid the word ‘fraudulent;’ it’s very likely to stick! it’s a 50% increase in atm co2 since 1750. Atm co2 is now the highest in 15 million years And that CO2 has saved the planet from plant starvation. It is a totally and absolutely beneficial increase in CO2 from desperately low level. There is absolutely zero down-side from increasing CO2 to even double or triple what it is today. If you think there is then prove it. First step…. 1… provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or stumble and faceplant on your own BS. Graph is a well know established graph, from well established sources. It is not fraudulent is any way whatsoever. ! YOU ARE AN IGNORANT LIAR. You have 100% negative credibility. ! I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. You sound like the all-knowing Karnack of Johnny Carson fame. Sorry to tell you, that was a parody of what you are doing. Show another graph that isn’t fraudulent according to you. There should be plenty of them as you say “mainstream science from the National Science Academies” tells all. I didn’t post any fraudulent graphs. Cite the time stamp. You didn’t post any graphs, And most of what is in your links is provable FAKE by their own data. Planet is still only a tiny bump above the coldest period in 10,000 years. Be every thankful of that. And there is no evidence human CO2 caused that highly beneficial warming. You will prove that, by producing no evidence… Oh look, Beetroot agrees with me. There is no evidence that CO2 causes warming. In the NH the current temperature is probably about on par with 1930s’ Modern warming is nothing but a tiny dot at the end of the chart, level with the left hand end. WB – you obviously do not have a traditional earth science background. The following image may help you get the “modern warming” in perspective. The only questionable figures on this image are the 2050 and 2100 temperature estimates on the right, and even 2050 is not a problem for this planet as it has happened during the Eemian, which is like yesterday in earth history. I have a very traditional science education from a top northeastern US University, and I am very familiar with this graph you’ve posted. It shows a projection that by the end of this century, global temperatures could be higher than they were during the Eemian, 120,000 years ago. What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Nor does it do anything to communicate the effects of such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. You might benefit from a scientific view of the risks that climate change presents to humanity, here: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ The projections shown by the red dots are totally BOGUS and not based on anything but pure conjecture. I replied to your JUNK PROPAGANDA below. !! Showed it was a total load of bollocks backed by absolutely nothing that could be considered remotely scientific. Now.. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or FAIL yet again. Your credibility is now at negative105% You should ask for a refund for your science education. You don’t seem to have learnt anything at all in those years. ! You are still an ill-informed or nil-informed scientific non-entity. ! There has NOT been a rapid rise in temperature, current level is barely a degree or so above the coldest period in 10,000 years. ! rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia Bullshit. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Your evidence link is nothing but propaganda pap, It contains absolutely zero evidence of anything You climate.gov link is no better. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Or you could just keep posting links to nebulous zero-science propaganda sites, and lower your credibility to -200% Your first statement about rate of warming is totally unsupportable BS. !! There is no way past data is defined enough to show that. In fact, before manic data adjustments the period from 1900-1922 was about the same rate as from 1970 onwards And as YOU have shown many times, there is no empirical evidence at all that humans have caused any of the small amount of highly beneficial warming. You are one of the most MAL-INFORMED fools I have ever come across. !! Not only that, we know from the UAH data that the current warming is NOT because of human CO2,. It is from extra solar energy reaching the tropical oceans, expressing as El Nino spike/steps at semi-regular intervals. There is absolutely no evidence of any human causation. If you think there is, Use UAH data to show us where it is. Think for yourself, not petty regurgitations… if you can find a pair of operable brain cells. Why should I believe your climastrology sites? So you are a Denier. There is NO SCIENCE on those pages. Just nonsense projections from unvalidated computer games. Nothing to “DENY” because they are just fantasy. Warren, two things. Don’t engage.. so he can avoid posting any evidence… as always. ?? So he can post climate nonsense and get away with it ?? —– “I firmly believe CO2 is a GHG and warms the earth” Ahhh.. another anti-science AGW-cultist… you are not a skeptic. Perhaps you would like to try… and fail. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Oh look, “the hoff”, a silly AGW “believer” runs away presents zero empirical evidence WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN !! “No matter what facts you put in front of him” Beeton has not put forward any actual “facts”. Haven’t you been watching. Neither have you. ! I’m quite prepared to discuss actual scientific evidence. Beeton hasn’t produced any. You know the questions. ! thanks. Four things from me: 1) I did not know that wuwt had a “position” on co2. It’s hard to find any consistent position on anything among skeptics. 2) I rarely engage with Bnice for the reason you state 3) The research behind climate sensitivity estimates is extensive. I’ve seen analysis that shows Even with the lowest values found in the literature, climate change is a severe economic, health and safety risk to humanity, and only a full transition of the global economy to zero carbon emissions by 2050 can avoid very serious effects. 4) I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science. Unfortunately, exceptions like yourself are a rarity on wuwt. Warren, Skeptics are not a homogenous group, but we call ourselves skeptics for the specific reason that that our skepticism revolves around issues like the benefits of mitigation versus adaptation and the severity of alarm that is appropriate. Bnice is an outlier, a vocal minority if you will, but “Denier” remains an odious term which belongs in no civil discourse. Anthony Watts started this blog a long time ago, and his position is that CO2 is a GHG. That was oft stated in the early days of this forum, it has unfortunately not repeated recently. In the early days there were extensive articles with in depth scientific analysis by well known skeptics that showed conclusively that the GHE is real and that CO2 is a GHG. These articles tend to be few and far between these last few years, so we are left with more political articles than the early days which were hardcore science. Even just a basic understanding of Stephen-Boltzmann Law shows that if the GHE is not real and there are no GHG’s, the earth would be snowball earth except perhaps for a stripe around the equator. You are correct that the research behind climate sensitivity is extensive. In decades of research though, the range in sensitivity estimates hasn’t changed much, though more recent papers tend to the lower side, support for the upper range is diminishing rapidly. Estimates for direct effects (3.7w/m2 per doubling) have not changed at all, but the sum total with feedbacks continues to be in dispute, ranging from as low as 1.7 Deg per doubling to 3.0 with the lower end having far more support recently. That, however, isn’t what skeptics are most focused on. The endangerment findings that you find so troubling are predicated on output from models, which have been consistently wrong. They’ve run too hot for decades, all except one. They continue to produce a tropospheric hotspot which has for decades been the “fingerprint” of catastrophe, except it exists ONLY in models, not in real world observations. Second, having paid close attention to the IPCC reports since AR3, there is a disturbing difference between the science itself in the main report and the Summary for Policy Makers, with the latter political documents often unrelated to the actual science. We’ve even seen one lead author demand his name be taken off the SPM for its unjustified alarm. But as the IPCC reports have evolved, each one has been more political than the previous. Consider for example the 1.5 degree “limit”. Where did this number come from? What science underlies it? The answer is none. It was arrived at by “expert opinion” from a group of scientists who are clearly biased toward alarm. I cannot summarize for you the entirety of the skeptic side in a single post, its a very broad topic. But on the issue of alarm, I shall leave you with this: We’ve gone from 280ppm of CO2 to 430, not far off one doubling. During that time, on a global basis, the IPCC has found no discernable trend in hurricanes, floods, droughts or wildfires. The four horsemen of the apocalypse as Forbes put it. What conclusion can we draw from this? If we put the models aside and just focus on data, the lack of a trend over decades doesn’t mean 100% for certain that there is no cause for alarm. But it does raise an important question which I can tell you from 20 years of debating this topic, tends to draw insults and jeers from the alarmists rather than any sober discussion of the facts. The question is, if the earth’s climate is so sensitive, so prone to unleashing climate fury upon the planet, why is there no sign in the data, collected over decades, of the deleterious effects? How can he climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2? Further, as CO2’s effects are logarithmic (hence the practice of quoting sensitivity in Deg C per doubling) each additional ppm of CO2 has less effect than the one before it. So the best conclusion that we can draw based on the data is that catastrophic changes in weather are not only insensitive to CO2 increase, they get less sensitive to each additional ppm. I wrote this article for WUWT about 9 years ago. Its has since been moved to different servers a couple of times so the formatting is screwed up. The links are also broken for the most part as the IPCC has moved their stuff around a lot too. Yes it is AR5 and the most recent report is AR6, I did say it was a 9 year old article. But the conclusions are still clear and easily read. The reason that I share it with you here is that as of AR5, it was VERY CLEAR from the IPCC’s main report (in other words the actual science, not the SPM) that there is no cause for alarm. Climate Change comes in dead last in nearly every category in terms of what the major effects on the human condition are likely to be in the future. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/01/01/we-have-bigger-problems-than-climate-change-so-sayeth-ipcc-ar5/ In fact, Richard Tol, lead author on multiple iterations of the IPCC reports shows up in comments on this article. One of his comments pertains to his reason for withdrawing from the SPM of his own chapter. No need for you to take me at my word. You can read it for yourself. There is also no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2 in any IPCC creation. It is all just conjecture and supposition. Would you care to provide that empirical evidence. Or just ignore the fact that you can’t, and go on “believing” like a good little AGW-cultist A whole lot of regurg. but still no empirical scientific evidence. A big FAIL !! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Other than the most basic theory of climate science –the GHE– I find most of your implied call for no action or minimal action unsupported in the scientific literature. Eg: 1) The latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) estimates equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely between 2.5°C and 4.0°C and very likely between 2.0°C and 5.0°C. The best estimate for ECS remains at 3°C. In order to safeguard the atmosphere and climate, responsible risk management requires insuring against the more severe of possible outcomes, not the mean. That implies mitigation policy based on an ECS between 3 and 4, possibly 5. Using an ECS less than 3C would be irresponsible risk management, and gambling with earth’s life support system. 2) Some models have run ‘hot’, but of course the IPCC is fully aware of this, and considers the ensemble of models with and without the hot models included. At the end of the day, for AR6 the IPCC has decided not to increase the upper end of IPCC ECS estimates in AR5 — which after all are not based on models alone, but also on paleoclimate data, as well as current warming trends. 3) It is untrue to claim, as you do, that none of the impacts of climate change have shown up. Clearly they have, and they are so identified and documented by the IPCC as effects based on current data, not on modeling. 4) Also, it is flawed logic to claim, as you do that because some impacts of climate change are not yet showing statistical significance, that they should be dismissed from a threat assessment. Modeling is based on real data and the physical behavior of earths climate system, and many of the models do indeed accurately reproduce the current warming trend. Disregarding future impacts based on those models would be irresponsible. 5) In your last paragraph you say, “How can the climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2?” AR6 is replete with examples that make that an absurd claim. As I said earlier, each iteration of the IPCC reports had become more political than the previous. I spend little time these days on IPCC reports. If I delve into something I delve into the papers upon which the reports are supposedly based. I find little alarming in them. The IPCC is a UN construct, and like many UN constructs, corrupt to the core. Their purpose is to grow their organization, their funding, and their power. If they were to proclaim that there is no cause for alarm, they would instantly be out of jobs. An executive position at the UN pays on the order of $700K per year. The incentive for alarm is obvious. Hence my focus on the actual papers than their conclusions. Sensitivity in the range of 5.5 Deg C per doubling is pure garbage. If it was that high would would see it leaping out of the data. But we don’t, we can barely tease the warming signal out of natural variability. As for the impacts, I did not say none have shown up. Its getting warmer. It doesn’t matter which temperature series you want to look at, its getting warmer. UAH, RSS, HadCrut, etc it is warmer now that it was 100 years ago. No doubt about it. That doesn’t change the fact that there are no discernable trends in the exact things we should be most worried about. Tree lines moving north is real, and not at all alarming. More arable land, not alarming. Island atolls aren’t being swamped by sea level rise, they are getting larger. Agricultural output has sky rocketed, outpacing population increases without using more land. For every heat related excess death we are seeing 10+ lives saved from excess cold. If you look at nothing but negative effects, you have reason for alarm. If you look at ALL the effects, it turns out that there are a lot of positives. In fact, the heights of civilization all coincide with the Medieval, Roman and Minoan warming periods. In fact history books record them as climate optimums. You might be able to convince me that we’re as warm now as the Medieval warming period, but the Roman and Minoan warming periods were absolutely warmer than it is now. As for irresponsible risk management, allow me to point out two things: I’m going to have a little fun with bnice blow, you might want to follow along just to be amused. A little fun with your headless chook routine showing absolutely zero empirical evidence. RUN AWAY again.. post a load of irrelevant regurg… Hilarious. ! Making a compete joke of yourself ??? What a load of low-end kamal-speak. Absolute GIBBERISH !! Pertaining to absolutely nothing but the stupid opinions of a manic AGW -cultist. Andreas not Antonius. I should review more before hitting the post button. Again, just waffling irrelevant gibberish… and mal-information. …. with no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Why is that? The models are a load of unphysical garbage filled with errors and unproven suppositions. They are little more than computer games. IPCC can make all the estimates of ESC they want, but they are all based on models that don’t remotely represent the atmosphere. There is no evidence ESC is anything but zero. It is massively irresponsible to waste billions of dollars based on erroneous garbage models while destroying electricity grids and the environment. You still haven’t present one bit of peer-reviewed science to back up anything you have said. You cannot even say what I “deny” that you can present actual empirical science to back You have zero credibility, because you are also totally clueless what journal peer-review even means or does. Here is some peer-reviewed science do you DENY the result? 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ found tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Seems YOU ARE A DENIER under your own description. Hi Bnice200, thanks for posting that. So, after insisting that there is NO empirical evidence to show that CO2 has ANY warming effect, you’ve now posted evidence that falsifies your own assertion. Hoisted on your own petard as they say. If we are to believe the 8 Taiwanese engineers you cite, take them completely at their word, assume their calculations are 100% accurate, then CO2 in fact DOES have a warming effect. Per your cite, going from 100ppm to 400ppm has a warming effect of 0.3 Deg C. Which means according to YOUR cite, all the rubbish you have cluttered up the threads with about there being no empirical evidence to show that CO2 has any warming effect at all are rubbish. Crap. Bull sh*t. You’ve just admitted that there IS an effect. Its not zero. They will not be the first to suggest a very low sensitivity, nor will they be the last. The point is that it is not zero as you claim. They start out though by “tripling” CO2 concentration from 100 to 400 ppm. They appear to have a math problem, that is quadrupling, not tripling. Then they make the astounding claim that there’s no additional warming from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Well if there is measurable warming from 100 to 350, then NO warming from 350 to 400 is physically impossible. So what game did they play to arrive at that conclusion? Well, they limited the calculations to 5 years. So they got a number so small that they rounded it off to zero. The real world doesn’t end in 5 years. But bottom line is they showed that CO2 in fact does have an effect, and all your blathering is wrong. Want some more empirical evidence? Here is a real experiment. A 10 cm long tube with IR transparent windows at each end is filled with an artificial atmosphere with 2.6 % water vapour and 357 ppm of CO2. They shine a known IR source in one end, and measure exactly what comes out the other end. Then they double the CO2 concentration and do it again. Their conclusion? 0.054w/m2. Very small, but most definitely NOT zero, read it for yourself: http://www.john-daly.com/artifact.htm Now let me explain why that conclusion is WAY too low. To get an actual result that is accurate using this methodology, you’d have to build an apparatus the height of the troposphere. Not practical, but the point being that you’d need thousands of these 10 cm tubes end to end and the total effect would be cumulative. Secondly, there is no ocean in this experiment, or a whole lot of other things that exist in the real world. In the real world increased temps promote more evaporation into an atmosphere that can hold more water, which is also a GHG. Feedbacks are real. Thanks for playing along, your apology is accepted. David H. is partially right when he points to a warming effect due to CO2. It was shown in the referenced paper which is likely from the same cause as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper. https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/german-researcher-doubling-of-atmospheric-co2-causes-only-0-24-c The cause is the widening of the 15 µm absorption window for CO2. This effect was also mentioned in the work by Wijngaarden and Happer. The problem is this is only part of the story. There is also an induced cooling effect by CO2 which appears to be of about the same strength. I’ve mentioned this in the past. It is caused by the increase in IR radiation at the surface leading to additional evaporation and enhanced convection (first mention by Dr. William Gray). As a result, Bnice turns out to be correct. There is no warming from increases in CO2 even going back to 100 ppm. (we could see some warming at less than 100) The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. If you want to pick nits, CO2 has an absorption band in the downwelling solar radiance. At surface this completely get swamped by water vapour, but at high altitude and high latitude it is cold, very little water vapour. So in theory CO2 in fact has a cooling effect too. Fun fact, there are winds that blow high in the atmosphere over Antarctica that are warmer than the surface below. So the net effect of CO2 there is to intercept downwelling photons from the warm winds and then xfer the energy either by collision or emission. So the “greenhouse effect” is actually reversed in Antarctica. Keep that in mind when you see some warming event in Antarctica being blamed on CO2. “Net positive feedback.” Again, a load of baseless supposition. Never proven. And if there is no CO2 signal , there is no feedback. So…. Still waiting for you to present some empirical scientific evidence of CO2 warming the atmosphere. All you have so far is empty waffle.. The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. Sorry, this is simply not true. You are missing the effects of saturation and convection. The increase in water vapor only occurs low in the atmosphere where all the energy available to H2O is already being absorbed, aka saturation. Can’t cause any warming there. The increase has the added effect of increasing buoyancy. This ends up driving convective currents higher into the colder troposphere which increases condensation. As a result you have less residual water vapor exactly where saturation is no longer in effect. This occurs primarily in the Tropics and then is carried by the Hadley circulation to the higher latitudes. The reduced water vapor ends up allowing more energy to radiate to space thus a cooling effect. The extra energy that was captured low in the atmosphere due to the widening of the absorption window is basically what is sent high in the troposphere as latent heat of the extra evaporation. This is the energy that now has an easier time getting to space. This is one of the non-obvious effects that have fooled most scientists, so don’t feel bad. There are more. “as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper.” Which for a small increase in CO2 in the last 100 or so years would lead to a totally immeasurable amount, totally swamped by natural variability. Poor Hoff.. the rabid AGW-cultist. ! Doesn’t understand the words “ no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm.” Then an experiment that cuts out convection, conduction and air movement so it no longer even remotely resembles the atmosphere. How much more stupid can you get !! And a call to the fallacy of WV feedback A complete FAIL !! It was not an experiment. It was a model. Its in the first effing paragraph of the description, FFS. You know what? Eff off. I’m putting you back on ignore. Calling ME a rabid AGW cultist is as ignorant and insult as one can get. I’ve authored well over a dozen articles for WUWT challenging the entire CAGW premise. I’ve dissected IPCC reports, I wrote damning articles calling out the hypocrisy in the leaked AR5 pre print which then disappeared from the final version. I’ve written for other skeptic forums, I have in fact risked my career by publicly refuting the CAGW thesis as I write under my own name. Do you have the guts to write under your own name? I am betting you do not. You’re just a troll whose only argument is to say anything that s shown to you is invalid. You clutter up threads with the same blather over and over. You are convincing no one except perhaps yourself. I actually feel rather sorry for you. Set/Bnice=Ignore The fact that you think an enclosed tube in any way represents the atmosphere, really does indicate the low level of your scientific understanding. Apparently you missed the entire part of the post where I explained exactly that? Do the words you disagree with just disappear while you are reading them? Or do you read them and then delete them from your brain? Ask me if I care about your stupid labels, shillboi. “So you are a Denier.” So you are a troll. I’m also a denier. Now you just have to figure out what I deny. Good luck! That is hate speach. What’s not accurate about this? “I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science” Which is a totally meaningless description when you are totally incapable of producing any peer-reviewed science. If you say I “deny” something you must be able to produce precise empirically based science to prove the thing you say I deny. So far you have failed absolutely and completely You have also shown that you are totally clueless what “peer-review” actually is. !! You are just a mouth, with no brain driving it. One of the issues that I have noticed with “traditional science education” is a lack of teaching of “traditional earth science”. In my day, there was a School of Applied Geology. That faculty no longer exists, and geology is a bit player in the school of Environmental Science. This lack of traditional earth science teaching and understanding leads to statements such as: What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Are you certain that is the case? NASA only goes back to 1880. The only other long term record is that for Central England which goes back to the 1600’s, but the data integrity is often questioned. The next alternative are temperature estimates from ice cores, with data points +/- a thousand years. Having another look at the CET data, it seems that a similar warming rate may have happened during the 1700’s. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature What do you find in the links that you disagree with? If so, why? Links aren’t working.. Both links work for me. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no data provided on any of your links to support this statement. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: ” The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 “ go back to the link and read footnote 1. You love your propaganda pap, don’t you beetroot. Quite pathetic that you think it is actual science, though !!. Not surprised that you can’t tell the difference between a bald-faced LIE, and actual science though. Let’s watch your squirm away in avoidance.. yet again… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Pre data adjustment…. graph didn’t attach…. And according to GISP data there have been several periods in the Holocene where warming was just as steep over a much large increase than current. Note, according to Mann the bottom of the current warming starts in 1850, so the end of the graph would be around the 1930s, very similar temperatures to now. My issue is with the claim that current (global) warming rates (ie 1960 to present) of about 0.24 DegC/decade is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no forensic method available to estimate such rates for a ~60 year period prior to about 1880. It rings my sciency alarm bells. BTW, I’m with you on nuclear! There is plenty of scientific literature explaining how proxy data,with error bars, allow for this determination. The NASA footnote cites AR6 Except you didn’t produce it. We can assume you have never read it while thinking. Just swallowed the nonsense hook line and sinker. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: You do realize that AR6 conclusions are based solely upon correlations and not causation don’t you? Again, you say you are trained in science, yet you use correlation as your proof? That is not scientific! I don’t believe you have the qualifications or competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the body of peer reviewed science. You are obviously totally lacking in any qualifications or scientific education. What you “believe” is totally irrelevant and has well below zero credibility. There is not data provided anywhere. it is all just mindless propaganda. This is what beetroot builds his case on.. NON-science nonsense. I have replied to this propaganda nonsense further down. That you seem to think it contains anything remotely scientific is a very sad indictment of the your education in science. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. From your NASA link : Takeaways While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. … … The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. [ Reference 1 ] The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. [ Reference 1 ] … … References References 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary OK, so it goes from a headline precise “in the past 10,000 years” to a more vague “over many recent millennia” in the main text, and just provides a reference to the (112 page PDF file) AR6 WG-I assessment report’s “Technical Summary” chapter. . In the “Introduction” to the TS there is a “Selected Updates and/or New Results since AR5” sub-section, in which we find (on page 41, bold in the original, underlining added by me) : Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. (Box TS.2, Section TS.2) The IPCC AR6 WG-I TS document referenced by the NASA webpage says “the last 2000 years”, not 10,000. Attached at the end of this post is a screenshot of panel a of Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1, which can be found on page 61. URL to IPCC original : https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/technical-summary/ts-ccbox-1-figure-1/ You will note that it repeats the “in a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years” number, neither “10,000” nor “many (recent) millennia”. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. . Your NASA “supporting evidence” link does not actually support your parroting of its “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Datasets with resolutions of “centuries” cannot be used to calculate “rates of warming” for periods of decades (/ “50 years”). Please try again. I Said “millennia”. 2000 is two millennia. This is lame even for you, shillboi. Mark had the receipts and this is all you can manage. Mark has no idea what data NASA has. Until he discusses with NASA, or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn, he hasn’t debunked anything. I trust NASA, not armchair deniers. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. Thanks for your forensic work Mark. It is a sad day when NASA allows unverified statements on their websites. ﻿ Nice write up Mark. One of the first things that triggered my BS meter was reading AR4 and coming across a value and wondering where it came from. The reference would be to a previous AR which would then reference a paper which would then reference another paper which would inevitably be behind a paywall. Accept their number or spend a fortune finding out where it came from. Why the obvious effort to shroud the source of a value used across multiple AR’s? I discovered that other people were asking the same questions and getting the run around. The second was the steadfast refusal to share data and methods. You’ll just try and find something wrong with it complained Hanson. Well isn’t that the whole point of science? Trying to find errors? The fate of humanity lies in the balance and these clowns are afraid we’ll find errors? If we did find errors, would that not be a cause for celebration, the world not ending after all? Or if we didn’t find errors it would prove them right, isn’t that what they want, for us to believe them? I got banned from multiple “science” sites for asking those questions. NASA global data back to 1850 is a manically distorted fabrication of homogenised urban heat effect surface data,. It is totally meaningless as a measure of global temperature change “such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. “ NONE of which actually exist in real data, except the highly beneficial temperature rise since the LIA. Warmth enhances health. 10X more people die from cold as from heat, life expectancy has increased massively due to warming and the products and use of fossil fuels. Environment.. the whole planet is much greener.. is that a bad thing. Only thing destroying the environment is wind and solar factories. Migration patterns are never set in stone. No trend in droughts.. Cold causes more droughts than warmth does. No trend (maybe slightly downwards) in storms or cyclones/hurricanes except the silly naming thereof. No increase in disasters, except where people build on flood plains etc. Infrastructure .. nope… you have nothing. So.. just another load of fake mantra pap from you. ! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. How many years does each dot on the graph cover? How do you determine the rate of change when a single point covers a century or a millennia. If you had a proper science education, you would know how to interpret time series graphs. Apparently you missed that day at school! Beetroot doesn’t seem to have any science background whatsoever !! And he has to resort to spamming to prop up his lies. Oh dear…the beetroot falls for on-line propaganda pap, yet again !! And there it is. As always the warmists ultimately rely on the “argument from authority” fallacious position rather than providing evidence that supports their claims. They rather believe that there are experts who can be relied on to tell them what the facts are because that’s what they are told by – you know -really smart people. For Mr. Beeton’s information, many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent. You cannot claim to be well educated on a subject unless you’ve thoroughly researched and considered all sides. I’ve only ever seen what I believe to be truly objective research on the climate change issue from what are called skeptics. “many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent.” So, since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research, every one of the 270 scientific institutions in the world, all University textbooks on Atmospheric Physics, and nearly every single researching climate scientist in the world contradict Deniers — who have no consistent theory to explain the warming of the planet — I consider your position to be untenable in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research Liar. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change Agree…. so what… because they get funding NOT ONE OF THEM provides scientific evidence that it does. If you think one does, then point to the exact one. That means you will have to read them all to find it exists… .. instead of posting links you are totally clueless about.. Modelled crap does not count. Noted, yet again you RUN AWAY. so funny to watch your headless chicken routine. 🙂 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. “problematic relationship with facts” And you have ZERO or negative relationship with facts. !! You run and hide from them. ! Noted that YET AGAIN you are totally incapable of supporting the very basis of your cult-religion Hilarious headless chicken routines to avoid the fact. You have NEVER read a book on Atmospheric Physics, you do not have a capability to understand it. The scientific incompetence is totally YOURS. Prove me correct , yet again.. !! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Your credibility is now at negative 220% Try again.. see if you can present something with any credibility.. or FAIL ! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. So just an appeal to “more and bigger” authorities? Perhaps you are unaware that all those scientific institutions represent mostly academic researchers highly dependent on massive government grants for their livelihood and those grants only go to those who support the approved narrative. Are you, by chance, one of them? You don’t even seem to know how bogus the 99% [97%] consensus argument is. You need to read more widely. He’s just regurgitating the talking points he’s been handed. “in the face of overwhelming evidence” You haven’t produced any actual scientific evidence. !! 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. You can DENY or ignore.. We know who the real “deniers” are. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. There is part of your problem. You have obviously not done a deep dive into your science education. Have you never been taught something by a professor and found it in error. Yet it has been propagated to many students through booksand papers the professor has written. How many text books still contain the Micheal Mann debunked hockey stick? As a student if you are taught this and never research it depth, you’ll never know it is based on suspect statistics. How many textbooks can you find that show empirical data substantiating the effective warming potential of CO2 as a cold body compared to the surface? How many textbooks deal with the subject using calculus to integrate the variations in day, month, annual orbital equations? How many just use averages and time series correlation? How many have a functional relationship between CO2 and surface temperature rather than just graphical time series? Climate science has not progressed into science yet. That is what makes me skeptical. Like it or not climate science is still at the alchemy stage of development still trumpeting that “We have found the way to make CO2 the control knob”! Youve now convincingly demonstrated you have neither the qualifications nor competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the peer reviewed scientific literature. You know absolutely NOTHING about peer-review, do you. ! Totally ignorant as to what it even means. You are LYING about having ever done any science. 100 scientists can agree with me, but it only take 1 to prove I am wrong. Who said that, again? Even if a ‘green’ future is necessary there are two fallacies in place. (1) Lack of due process (2) You can’t throw a switch, which, of course, you might learn with due process. No fallacies required. First, all climate policy are and must be carried out constitutionally by legislation or by constitutional executive orders. Second, no policymakers advocate ‘throwing a switch’. Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. But fallacies are all you have.! There is no transition underway in any country that isn’t destroying it economy World fossil fuel use remains around 80% of world energy use, wind and solar are a tiny slice, barely visible on the graph below. There is absolutely zero need to move away from fossil fuels to unreliable, erratic, intermittent parasitic low-integrity energies like wind and solar. Yes there is a transition, well underway in the world, including the US, EU, Japan, and China. EVs are in production, and more in development, 80% of new power generation capacity being installed is solar wind or nuclear, and funding and incentives from legislation is already helping to build out infrastructure. In addition, 42 countries are considering, or already have in place, a carbon tax. Also, this year the EU has implemented a new border carbon adjustment mechanism that will incentivize trade with countries that have a carbon tax. Lots happening, so you need to pay attention if you want to have credibility in your comments. Data says otherwise. Fossil fuel growth continues to outstrip wind and solar That 80% is really less than 20% when considering capacity factors.. sorry if you are too dumb to realise that. The largest countries in the world continue to massively increase their fossil fuel energy use. Countries CANNOT survive or progress without fossil fuels.. period. ! You rely totally on them every day of your pitiful existence. Drive a battery car yet, beetman? If no, you’re a hypocrite. If yes, you’re a sucker. so that makes you….uneducated Noted , yet again, the total lack of anything remotely related to scientific evidence. You ran away from answering, just like all the other AGW shills. I wonder if he parks and charges his pretend EV in an attached garage. He is dumb enough to do that. ! BOOM! Goes the Chinese EV. Have you come to grips with the fact that indeed global temperatures are rising at the fastest rate in millennia? “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Spamming is all you got in the tank, shillboi.

This is pure fantasy. Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions. Look at the various COPs and at progress (or lack of it) on the Paris agreements. The plain fact is, no-one outside of the English speaking countries and Germany has taken global warming seriously, and the countries that have tried to reduce their emissions from electricity generation are right now seeing themselves approaching the cliff of intermittency. And not liking it, getting very alarmed, and getting ready for U-turns. As will happen in February in the US. The other countries are just growing their economies as fast as possible, and letting emissions and coal use go where they may. “Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions”. China’s goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. and they are well on their way,,ahead of most countries including the US. Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China. wind and solar in China are barely visible in the energy chart They now have a working pebble bed nuclear, those will expand rapidly, and wind and solar will be left to rot. ! Not one nation has a chance of meeting their FAKE goals. Wind and solar make up a very small part of China’s energy usage, they have had hydro for a long time. EV’s in China make sense, crowded huge cities… anything is better than those old 2 cycle motor bikes., and the COAL fired power they will run is well out of the cities. Places like USA and America EVs are basically just a low-level second car or virtue-seeking of very little actual use. Plans, stated to fool twits like you and your mates.. works every time… … yet their use of coal grows year one year. The others are just gimmicks to fool the western world into sticking with the idiotic net-zero plan to destroy their manufacturing bases. It will fail in the USA now Trump is in, because he will aim fossil fuel self-dependency in a very short time 😆 “dropping by more than 80% by 2060.” By then, all their current coal fired power stations will be still running at high efficiency. Current wind and solar will have ceased to function and be in scrap heaps or left to rot. Why always portray new renewable energy sources with capacity rather than actual production of energy? World wide renewable energy production is about 20% of stated capacity. Combined renewable wind and solar with 100 Giga-watts of capacity over time have average output of about 20 Giga-watts of energy. Because it is the only way they can keep the hoax alive. shillboi — praising his marxist masters and earning his keep. So Warren, why are you using FF every day? And I bet you have no solar panels on the roof. If you are going to talk the talk then you better walk the walk. Do not be a hypocrite. So Jim, do you need to read this in my post? “ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway” I’m doing my share — including lobbying my Congressional representative and Senators to pass climate legislation. What are you doing, Jim? “I’m doing my share” Yep, you continue to use fossil fuels every second of every day. Trump is in now.. All this anti-CO2 nonsense will disappear. Drill baby, drill ! 🙂 ““ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway”” 1… NOT underway, fossil fuels % is holding steady and is still BY FAR the main energy supply 2… Politically and idiotology based wishful thinking and propaganda. The Anti-CO2 nonsense will be dead and buried by 2050. Harold the Organic Chemist Says ATTN: Warren RE: CO2 Does Not Cause Warming Of Air. To refresh your memory, shown below in the graphic are plots of temperatures from the weather station at Furnace Creek in Death Valley from 1922 to 2001. In 1922, the concentration of CO2 was 303 ppmv (0.6 g of CO2/ cu. m. of air), and, by 2001 it had increased to 371 ppmv (0.7 g/cu. m. of air), but there was no corresponding increase in the air temperature. The reason for no temperature increase is quite simple: There is too little CO2 in the air. At the MLO in Hawaii, the current concentration of CO2 in dry air is 422 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has 0.8 g of CO2 and a mass of 1.29 kg at STP. This small amount of CO2 can heat up such a large mass of air by a very small amount if at all. I remined you that the heavy industries and heavy transportation systems will always use enormous amounts of fossil fuels. It is now winter in the Northern Hemisphere and huge amounts of fossil fuels will be used for space heating. NB: The graphic was obtained from the late Joh Daly’s website: “Still Waiting For Greenhouse” available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow “What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” Richard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Climate “Science” | Dr. Richard Lindzen | Jordan B Peterson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVSrTZDopM Beetroot relies absolutely and completely on the many things that use fossil fuels. He could never exist without them. Even beetroots need CO2 to grow.. Don’t be too hard on the poor baby, bnice! He’s so delusional that he actually believes that a trace gas has more control over our climate than oceanic cycles and currents, or the Sun! Think how embarrassing it is going to be for him when the adults in his life finally have to explain reality to him! Some are made to be fools! No, Mr. Beeton, you are wrong. There is absolutely no need to bankrupt economies in fear of global warming. A warmer Earth would be an entirely beneficial thing. Historically, the Earth has been warmer than today for 99% of the last 240,000,000 years. We are currently in a Great Ice Age. The coldest point in geologic history was a mere 20,000 years ago, a blip in geologic time. Feigned ignorance of these facts is deliberate abuse of science. No preceding period or epoch with a warmer climate was detrimental to life. On the contrary, life was abundant in past warmth, more abundant, widespread, bio-diverse, and productive than today. All human endeavors also benefit from warmth, including agriculture. The warmest climes are the best for farming, ranching, forestry, and horticulture. That’s a known fact. And CO2 increases yields of all the above. Production of food, clothing, and shelter increase with increasing warmth. The basic needs for human survival correlate. AI, on the other hand, is not needed at all, provides no survival necessity, is a toy, a useless indulgence, and is in fact a hazard to human survival and the well-being of all life. Nope. The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good. But if not done, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen. Governments are moving ahead, including in the US. You may not like it, but the energy transition is underway “…, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen….” where are your “costs” and “bad effects” Put up or SHUT UP ! Read and be educated: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ “Scientists predict ” you can’t show any of your imaginary effects are happening . But just Beet on . Still only find nebulous propaganda pap.. that is just sad. Nothing on that page has a single bit of scientific credibility whatsoever. U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy. Climate Changes Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond Based on fake unvalidated models.. ie scientific BS. btw, the climate has ALWAYS changed over time, so I’m assuming they mean the fallacy of human-based CO2 warming. Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. More Droughts and Heat Waves No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. Longer Wildfire Season Wildfires in the USA consumed far larger areas in the 1930s Yet another piece of fakery based on unvalidated models. Changes in Precipitation Patterns Have happened throughout history, no evidence human causes them except local land use. Frost-Free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen GREAT NEWS for farmers and food supply, but still based on unvalidated models. Global Temperatures Will Continue to Rise Again, based on unvalidated models based on unproven erroneous assumptions. Arctic Is Very Likely to Become Ice-Free More model based BS, Arctic has been stable for last 15 years after recovering from an extreme peak in 1979. Is still far above the extent for most of the last 10,000 years All just propaganda pap for the low-IQ ignorant AGW-cultist. And you still put it forward as “evidence” !!! Really You have well below zero credibility !! Lets see if you can provide some precise evidence rather than this sort of nonsense and mantra pap. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow. You are DELUDED and brain-hosed, until all that is left in your skull is a sickly green ooze. President Donald Trump will put an end to this energy transition nonsense by ending the billion dollars of subsidies for wind an solar. Legislation is required to change US energy policy. At the moment, the Republican margin in the House is razor thin, and they are so fractured, they can’t get anything done. in two years, the other party will likely be back in power in the House and the energy transition will continue . You think Trump can’t find away around the green mess that stops progress. Great to see you so against democracy….. you must be a marxist or a moron. ! And you are even more deluded than I thought. ! Only transition in the USA has been from coal to GAS. DRILL BABY DRILL. Trump flipped 4 Senate seats at the last election. He could easily flip a few more in two years time. Probably had 3 more if the marxo-democrats didn’t count “ballots” for week on end. “Governments are moving ahead, including in the US.” Drill Baby DRILL !! cheaper cleaner energy Liar. “The wind and sun are free!” — Nitpick Nick Stokes Over their short life time from mining to disposal, wind and solar are one of the most polluting forms of electricity there is. The amount of mining and highly toxic chemicals used in their production is horrendous. They then decimate whole environments, farmland and avian critters in their installation and use. Then at end of their short life have to be disposed of in dump sites, leave huge lumps of concrete in the ground And they are not clean! Oh dear still falling for that furphy. So MAL-EDUCATED and gullible. SOLAR DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT Are you so dumb that you don’t realise that? It is almost totally absent at peak electricity usage. All it is is a parasitic supply available only when the sun shines. Everywhere that wind and solar infect the grid.. …. electricity prices SKYROCKET. ! And you STILL haven’t answered the question… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. OK, shillboi, see if you can answer this: What material is vital for the production of steel, glass, silicon, etc. from raw ores? And the IEA is a much bigger liar than you. N.B. shillboi ran away from answering. The answer is coal and petroleum. You quote the International Energy Agency? Try finding a credible source. You are deep into your Denial Silo — denial of peer reviewed science, now denial of reliable sources, and embrace of junk science. Another moronic comment from the beetroot. https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Is-Cheapest-Energy-Source-Says-IEA.html It is also BY FAR the most polluting of all electricity supply options. It’s truly one of the most filthy industrial processes ever invented. The mining, acid leaching, high tonnage coal use for heat treatment and smelting with associated fumes and silicosis disease from dusts and much more makes solar manufacturing one of the filthiest processes ever. It costs 3x more to recycle than landfill, so recycling is nearly non-existent. The toxic heavy metals leach out over time. The first step in cleaning silica to produce metallurgical grade silicon is to rinse it with a mixture of one part acid to one part water This process is called acid leaching and is used to remove impurities such as iron, aluminium, and calcium from the silica. The purified silica is then heated with carbon in the form of coal or charcoal in an electrode arc furnace at a temperature of 1500-2000°C to produce metallurgical grade silicon that is 98% pure.. Some of the solvents used are hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid possibly in combination with each other as a solvent for purification of MG-Si. You are POLLUTION WORSHIPPER….. disgusting !! You are absolutely correct, silicon wafer production is not an easy task. Bullshit, from a bullshitter. “The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good“ Which is why electricity prices SKYROCKET everywhere the infection of wind and solar gets too big. 😉 New AI in the USA will mean a HUGE increase in GAS, and nuclear… … and coal is also likely to make a big resurgence. Wind and solar are totally useless for this purpose. It is neither cheaper nor is it cleaner. So Beeton is gaslighting? Who could have ever guessed? That is a categorically false statement. You are ignoring reality. Its is totally TRUE. You are just too dumb to realise you are doing it. From the electronic bible… The iron shall lie down with the lamp Climate change is not a problem, they have a crisis of faith Running an industrial society on wind and solar will require science fiction level storage, something with the performance of Robert Heinlein’s Shipstones. A major plot element in “Friday” was that the trade secret was so valuable the various factions of the Shipstone Trust run that fictional society. A note to various investment companies:it is fiction. Thanks for the Heinlein reference. I was not aware of that when I mentioned that AI would require dependable energy “in science-fiction-like quantities.” “These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.” Really? I kinda doubt it- other than some rare moments. I don’t know- somebody here can nail it down. It is actually about correct. Go to https://ourworldindata.org/energy Scroll down to the selection boxes about half way down, and click “Electricity Mix” Find the graph which has a tab saying “edit countries and regions”, deselect ‘World’ and select the country you want to look at. You should get a chart where you can read of the values for each type of electricity supply, and be able to do some quick calculation. Bear in mind though… both the UK and Germany are teetering on the edge of collapse energy-wise and are destroying all their manufacturing base because of very high electricity prices. They are on their way to third world status. Anglo-Saxons are practically there … Practically, but.., ‘Strained’ Keir Starmer badly needs holiday, his friends say as they reveal PM is suffering from the ‘relentless strain’ of the job https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14217547/Strained-Keir-Starmer-badly-needs-holiday.html Snowflake PM For the UK, number is actually 43% https://www.cladcodecking.co.uk/blog/post/renewable-energy-percentage-uk and for Germany 52% https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/renewables-cover-more-half-germanys-electricity-demand-first-time-year#:~:text=Clean%20Energy%20Wire,-, according to these two sources. Even if these numbers are too high, the wind and solar contribution is large enough to have put both countries in jeopardy from Dunkelflaute in November and again in the past 10 days, after I wrote the piece. There is a very simple solution to our energy conundrum, we know big tech, AI and related industries need outrageous amounts of power. If we want a reliable and plentiful source of energy we put them last in line for the power. In other words if there is a danger of a brown out or black out they are the first to have to cut back. The health and wellbeing of the citizen comes before anything else. If we demanded this new fossil fuel and nuclear generators would start popping up everywhere and the big tech/AI guys would be standing in line to help finance them. As for the government and outfits like Blackrock they can go to hell. We don’t much care what they think. Also, maybe, those with the larger demand should pay more per unit because they’re putting a strain on the system. Yes, they should pay more. In Virginia, the legislature is considering changing the cost allocation formula to put more of the burden on data centers instead of spreading the costs across all rate payers. Is that the Virginia that plans to import lots of coal, gas and nuclear powered electricity from out of state ?? Virginia is basically surrounded by Republican states. I hope they say.. “If you want the data centre, the you provide the electricity for it.” That will force Virginia to build new COAL, GAS or NUCLEAR power stations. That would be fun to watch 🙂 Or, require the data centers to build their own power plant. Joseph, I don’t want them treated different in any way so long as they see to it that new fossil fuel and nuclear generators are built. I would hope that since they are so dependent on reliable and available energy that they would build plenty for all of us. Germany and UK are moving steadily toward economic oblivion. BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen are all facing losses with massive slump in profitability. It is not possible to combine 2,500kg of exotic materials in a way that makes any motor vehicle suitable for the masses. They are creating engineering monstrosities unfit for purpose. A motor vehicle weighing 2,500kg capable of carry 4 people and luggage – say 500kg payload. The Ford Model T weighed 750kg and could transport 750kg if needed. It was a useful vehicle. . Great for woke virtue-seeking though !! “AMD’s new series scales from eight cores up to the $14,813 192-core / 384-thread EPYC 9965, a 500W behemoth that leverages TSMC’s 3nm node for the ultimate in compute density with dense Zen 5c cores.” A building full of these for a super-computer will require several nuclear generators Quick…. build the solar farm to drive it. 😉 Conventional data centers consume about 300-400 watts per sq ft. AI will increase that number 3x or 4x, or more. And that will require solid reliable electricity supply Are you ADVOCATING GAS or Nuclear ? Even a nil-educated monkey like you must know that wind and solar can never provide. He is the co-founder of the Prince William Virginia Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby and teaches the science of energy and climate change to continuing education students in Northern Virginia. Is this you ? That’s a collection of uneducated brain-washed students in the making !! No hope for their future , thanks to this low level indoctrination. Really sad. The IEA estimates that data centres total electricity consumption could reach the equivalent of the electricity consumption of Japan by 2026. IEA ‘Electricity 2024 Analysis and forecast to 2026’ (Jan 2024) Ok. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind. Or, investors should recognize that an AI stock market bubble is growing and will eventually burst. I want to put my money into self-driving cars! Then sell them to gullible Democrats and AGW-cultists. 🙂 What could possibly go wrong !! 😉 The future of AI investments was outside the scope of my piece. See this Goldman Sachs report, in particular the comments by Acemoglu and Covello https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai–too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at?ref=wheresyoured.at Half of what most people think about AI is true and the other half not. The true part is that it is artificial. As for renewable, green, net zero, climate protecting, sustainable, energy systems, the only true part is that they are tenuously connected somehow to the idea of energy.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the Heart of Liberty Blog. Don Harrision Sign Up To Receive Regular Heart of Liberty Bulletins Here The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. Isaiah 11:6 The book of Isaiah, written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, prophesies a utopia where all natural enmities disappear and predators and prey become as one and take the same sustenance. It is understandable that the Israelites of the time, oppressed by Assyrians and Babylonians, would long for a peaceable kingdom. Today, however, it is less understandable – in fact downright baffling — that investment managers who pride themselves on their rationality seem to believe that we live in a world in which physics and economics have gone with the wind, and the lions in their portfolios can prosper on a diet of straw. The conceit I am referring to concerns the voracious lions of artificial intelligence (AI) and the utopian dream of decarbonization. The AI revolution needs the red meat of reliable power – in science-fiction-like quantities – while the decarb dreamers’ windmills and solar panels can deliver only unsatisfying amounts of marginally nutritious straw. Many investment managers own shares of AI leaders[1] such as Nvidia while simultaneously professing a commitment to net zero CO2. This is portfolio management animated more by blind faith than by proven, analytical process. Investors would be wise to question whether they wish to invest with organizations which seem almost willfully ignorant of the performance-sapping implications of this conflicted approach. AI Power Needs — AI’s bottomless appetite for power is no secret. Google “AI need for power” and you will find that banks, corporations, NGO’s, think tanks and major publications are all on the case: These examples are just the tip of the AI power-requirement iceberg. Investment Companies Are Aware of AI’s Power Appetite — Investment management organizations that own AI leaders[8] are certainly cognizant of this coming tidal wave of energy demand: Unlike those whom Jesus’ castigated in the Gospel of Matthew[13]forhaving eyes but refusing to see, these firms understand AI’s growing hunger for electricity. Renewable Inconstancy — It is also no secret that the net-zero utopians’ favorite power sources – wind and solar – are unreliable. In fact, an understanding of the capricious nature of the wind and the effect of clouds on sunshine is so ingrained in our experience that generative AI, whose “intelligence” is fueled by millennia of human poetry and prose, can churn out an endless stream of cliches on the subject such as “love as fleeting as the fickle summer wind” and “troubles like a veil of clouds.” Academics, not satisfied with machine-made similes derived from common knowledge, have felt the need to conduct studies to prove that wind and solar “are inherently highly variable due to volatile weather conditions.”[14] And if age-old wisdom and academic elucidation of the obvious leave any doubt about renewable instability, the UK and Germany have been kind enough to erase it by inadvertently conducting nationwide demonstration projects. These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.[15] In early November of this year, both countries experienced what the Germans call Dunkelflaute (dark doldrums), which arises when high-pressure systems diminish wind and thicken clouds.[16] In the UK, this meant its wind farms were able to meet just 3-4% of the countries’ electricity demand, and in Germany theirs operated at only 7% of capacity.[17] Of course, grid operators had to call on natural gas and coal to step into the breach.[18] Charles Rotter at Watts Up With That? has pointed out that a proposed solution from the UK’s National Energy System Operator to this regular winter issue is “system flexibility”[19] — bureaucratize for public rationing and adjustment of energy usage based on availability. Cooking your dinner early or reading that bedtime novel at 2 pm in anticipation of a calm evening may seem trivial sacrifices to make for the greater good of saving Gaia, but imagine a world in which Dunkelflaute starves a power-hungry AI tasked with the 24/7 running of cybersecurity, healthcare and energy transmission: millions of credit cards compromised by foreign actors, AI-enabled robotic surgeons unable to perform life-saving operations, and the ironic last straw — the meager amount of power being generated by these renewables dies on the vine because the grid is managed by AI. We can’t trust AI with vital, economy-wide duties if it has to rely on gentle breezes and occluded sunshine. Investment Companies Are Aware of Renewable Shortcomings— The research teams at AI-invested portfolio managers are just as aware of renewables’ innate limitations as they are of AI’s appetite for electricity: Inconsistency, variability, intermittency. These investment companies’ analyses of the dependability of wind and solar read like indictments drawn up by Roget’s Thesaurus. Batteries on White Horses — Of course, no investment organizations believe that we can achieve a net zero future that still enables AI with wind and solar alone; as Blackrock has pointed out, these are only a half solution.[24] Continuous dispatchability requires grid-level battery storage. Clearbridge thinks batteries will be an integral part of a renewable infrastructure industry that will achieve compound annual growth rates of 10-30% for the next 30 years.[25] JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Blackrock have all put their money where their mouths are, investing billions in battery storage companies such as Strata Clean Energy, Gridstor, Eku Energy and Waratah.[26] These investment firms are heeding the call of the International Energy Agency (IEA),[27] one of the high priests of net zero. For the IAE, grid-level battery storage will ride to renewables’ rescue like a green savior on Revelations’ white horse,[28] and alchemize the benign but capricious production of turbines and solar panels into ever-dispatchable abundance. Straw Batteries — But how likely is it that battery storage will be renewable’s salvation, and provide the inexpensive, always-on power needed to sustain the AI industry? Mark Mills is a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a contributing editor at City Journal, a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick school of engineering, director of the National Center for Energy Analytics, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of numerous books and articles on energy and digital technology.[29] I have corresponded with Mark and followed his work for almost 25 years and have found him to be insightful, perspicacious and refreshingly thorough on every subject he turns his mind to. In a rare moment of agreement between Bill Gates and myself, Gates has said that Mark’s book The Bottomless Well “is the only book I’ve ever seen that really explains energy.”[30] In testimony before the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Mark had this to say about grid-level battery storage:[31] Given the almost unfathomable cost and scale of material production required for sufficient grid-level batteries, in all likelihood they are not the magic that will transform wind and solar into the robust energy source AI demands. The Last Straw — This past April, a Wall St. Journal piece explored a seemingly redemptive paradox embedded in the nature of AI: at first glance it looks to explode power usage, but at the same time it holds out the promise that it can increase energy efficiency and thereby reduce consumption.[32] The article focuses on savings in real estate, but the alleged potential is economy-wide. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser believes efficiency gains over the past 15 years – before the advent of AI – have reduced energy demand by the equivalent of 90 million barrels of oil a day.[33] If smart thermostats, electronic sensors in fuel injectors and other relatively crude enhancements have produced this remarkable accomplishment, imagine what the coming AI revolution can achieve through predictive consumption forecasting, renewable energy integration, intelligent grid management and other currently undreamed of wonders! But does Mr. Nasser’s observation about reduced energy demand mean that the world has reduced its energy consumption over the past 15 years? Not according to Our World in Data, which shows overall energy consumption growing by 20% during this period:[34] These last 15 years continue a consistent post-war phenomena: no matter how much we increase vehicle mpg and no matter how many Thermopane windows we install, humanity unfailingly and mysteriously gobbles ever more energy. Only recessions induce power dieting (gold arrows). So is the Saudi Aramco CEO a liar or an ignoramus, or perhaps nefariously spinning the facts to benefit the oil industry? The answer is probably not – on all 3 counts. Most likely, he is referring to efficiency gains in isolation, and neglecting the further consequences of those efficiencies. More energy saving devices and processes would reduce energy consumption if all things remained equal, but we live in a dynamic world where changing inputs leads to unexpected outputs. Imagine in a previous life that you were a blacksmith who specializes in iron plow shares. You’re a brilliant fellow, and you devise a method that burns less wood to generate the heat needed to forge and shape the iron. You subsequently reduce your prices, which means poorer peasants can now afford your plowshares. This leads to more land under cultivation, which creates a burgeoning population, which ignites an ever-greater consumption of the wood needed to meet this expanding market that you and thousands of other imitative smiths are now servicing. And which – depending on your perspective – makes God’s green earth a little more paradisiacal for you and your fellow man, or eventually transforms it into a Boschian hellhole pocked by the pustules of oil derricks, coal mines and fracking and uranium waste. But no matter which way you look at it, your fuel-efficient advancement in metal-working most surely does not reduce energy consumption. All of which leads us to the real paradox regarding AI and power: Jevon’s Paradox. William Stanley Jevons was a British economist who first described this phenomenon in a paper in 1865. It is now so widely known and so well documented that Google’s generative AI app has a synopsis, but I prefer the human insight of Mark Mills: AI will create fuel-usage efficiencies, but it will in turn undoubtedly lead to increased consumption. The Saudi Aramco exec was probably not trying to hoodwink us. As radio host Paul Harvey would have put it, he just didn’t consider “the rest of the story.” Perversely, one man’s energy diet plan begets mankind’s need for an energy feast. Let Them Eat Straw — In spite of their awareness of both AI power requirements and of the fickle nature of wind and solar, in spite of the well-publicized issues with grid-level battery storage, and in spite of the widespread knowledge of Jevon’s Paradox and its implications for the notion that AI-effectuated efficiencies will reduce energy consumption, many investment management organizations continue to demonstrate a deep commitment to a net-zero future and to its proponent organizations: In the investment management community, Clearbridge’s membership in a climate-change organization that promotes decarbonization through wind and solar is not an anomaly. PRI, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, Ceres Investor Network and Climate Action 100+ are 5 of the most prominent of these initiatives. Of the 10 largest fund companies, 9 are signatories to at least one of them, and collectively they hold 31 memberships.[42] Blackrock is a member of four of these outfits, and Blackrock International belongs to the fifth.[43] Blackrock’s Chairman Larry Fink, in a Wall St. Journal op-ed,[44] has called for a capital spending boom to build an “AI transcontinental railroad” that will juice U.S. real economic growth to 3% and increase tax revenues, thereby helping to mitigate the national debt crisis. But nowhere in this article does Mr. Fink mention that his company funds outfits who long to starve the railroad’s engines of fuel. Investment managers’ devotion to decarbonization also manifests itself in their proxy voting records. Each year, Pension Politics analyzes the proxy voting record of investment management companies, based on their votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[45] These are 50 of the most extreme ESG-oriented proposals, 27 of which in 2023 were climate related. These proposals not only require companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree target, but to report on how their lobbying, insuring and investing activities, and their involvement in trade associations and other alliances, promote decarbonization.[46] At first glance, these proposals appear to be the grassroots efforts of a diverse group of shareholders who are agnostic on the means of achieving net zero (“the strategy on how to achieve this target is entirely up to the Board”).[47] But in fact they are the handiwork of a small number of progressive non-profits such as Green America, As You Sow and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, all of whom are crusaders for wind and solar.[48] Green America does not try to hide its absolutist advocacy of these so-called renewables: “it is critical to the future of the planet that society moves away from all carbon-producing sources of energy and invests heavily in renewables such as wind, solar, geothermal, and second-generation biofuels.”[49] The other organizations appear to be making a conscious effort to obscure their belief in the role that wind and solar will need to play in the descent to net zero. They use fuzzy, feel-good language, but there can be little doubt that they believe a “just transition to a green economy,” the “phase in of low-carbon energy resources,”[50] and an “equitable energy future” will require an abundance of wind and solar, as evidenced by the many pictures of solar panels and windmills that adorn their web sites.[51] Of the 820 investment outfits Pension Politics graded this year, 520 received a D or F for their proxy votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[52] A major contributing factor to these firms’ poor grades was their collusion with these obscure, radical climate-change zealots to force corporate America to decarbonize. Supposedly the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, when told that her starving peasants had no bread, advised them to eat cake. Though there is no historical evidence that she said this, today there is ample evidence that many investment management organizations, through their support of decarbonization and its handmaidens, are effectively telling the AI lions in their portfolios to eat straw. A Schizophrenic Vision — All investing involves a vision of the future. That vision may originate from a top-down analysis of the economy in which a portfolio manager buys REITs because money supply growth has recently abated, creating the conditions for a snowballing beneficence: inflation will drop, the Fed will lower rates, REIT interest costs will decline, their earnings will increase and their stock prices will climb. Or it may start with a more humble, bottom-up approach: a second manager buys XYZ company because its new CEO will soon jettison the money-losing companies purchased by his profligate predecessor, and return XYZ to its profitable roots. In either case, each of them has envisioned a future friendly to particular stocks or industries, and positioned their portfolios accordingly. But imagine if the first manager buys REITs because of the scenario outlined above, and then pens an opinion piece in the Wall St. Journal urging the Federal Reserve not to lower rates because that will increase inflation. Or if number two buys XYZ and tries to talk the new CEO into maintaining his predecessor’s legacy. A Freudian would call this schizophrenia, while a Christian might invoke the Gospel of Mark to warn that portfolio management divided against itself cannot stand, but they would both probably agree that this is a bizarre, contrary, unworkable approach to making money. The promotion of renewables by AI-owning investment firms is similarly confused. Either AI thrives in a world powered by the proven, reliable bounty of fossil fuels and nuclear fission, or it starves on wind, solar and wishful thinking. In addition — though the full exploration of this is a topic for another day — a decarbonized economy will suffer from low productivity and anemic growth because of renewables’ inefficiency and lack of energy density. This means that nationwide economic growth — the wind at the backs of all companies – will experience its own Dunkelflaute, enfeebling the returns of every investor and every investment organization, not just those that own AI stocks. AI giants such as Microsoft and Google still publicly cling to the hope that they will be carbon-neutral by 2030, in spite of the recent AI-driven upwelling in their consumption of traditional energy. Analysts who see things in the harsh light of day, however, call this dream “ridiculous.”[53] It is high time that the investment management organizations that own these AI operating companies come to this same clear-eyed understanding, and clarify the conflicted vision that shapes their portfolios. They need to either divest themselves of AI or cease to worship at the altar of net-zero. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind.

Type your email… Subscribe Unlike Mr Harrison, policymakers, investors and data center owners (including anyone with any education) are aware of the importance of eliminating CO2 emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear energy Oh, I see- only stupid people prefer fossil fuels and voted for Trump. I see that attitude all the time, especially here in elitist Wokeachusetts. No nukes here, though- they’ve all been shut down. I said anyone with an education knows about climate change and its solutions. If you know about nuclear, then you know about one important solution. You meant , “any person with an indoctrination”… blah, blah Come on, In what way have humans change global climate change that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? You also need to provide empirical scientific evidence that CO2 has any measurable warming effect. But you will fail again, as you always do. That means you are yapping an ideology you have no evidence for. Religions and cults work that way. There is NO CLIMATE PROBLEM, certainly not from fossil fuels. So no “solution” is required. Nuclear is possible future major energy supply.. Wind and solar are nothing but a parasitic fad. There is absolutely zero need to eliminate CO2 emissions. That is a fallacy which has been brain-washed into gullible twits. CO2 is ALL benefit, no downside. It feeds plant life hence feeds all creatures on the planet. Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming. Fossil fuels have raised modern civilisations and will continue to be a very major source of energy for a long time to come, they cannot be dispensed with if civilisations want to continue to exist. Wind and solar are just a fake parasitic measure to combat a fake anti-CO2 agenda, and are actually one of the most polluting forms of energy over their short life-cycle. “Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming.” _______________________________________________________________________ Oh they might do that, but then they have to say why ﻿warming is a problem which it isn’t. See #2 on the list: 1. More rain is not a problem. 2. Warmer weather is not a problem. 3. More arable land is not a problem. 4. Longer growing seasons is not a problem. 5. CO2 greening of the earth is not a problem. 6. There isn’t any Climate Crisis. I have searched. I have asked many people to help find that evidence.. … but still, nada, zip.. nothing !! Since you can’t read, think, or speak rationally, I like your posts because there is nothing of substance I have to bother with! As expected… still, nada, zip.. nothing !! … In what way have humans changed the global climate that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? Produce EVIDENCE !!…… or not 😉 That’s rather rich coming from a moron like you! Please specify which of the geologic epochs have lower temperatures and CO2 levels than the Holocene, and just how you propose to prevent the death of ALL LIFE ON EARTH from CO2 starvation during a glacial expansion sometime in the next 1,000,000 years! Your ability to regurgitate corporate propaganda is only exceeded by your ignorance! And you are contradicted by all scientific research worldwide when you claim ‘climate change isn’t a problem’. Read any of the scientific reports from the NAS, the Royal Society, or NASA here: https://climate.nasa.gov The Royal Society? Nullius in verba. Especially them. Sorry, anyone that posts fraudulent graphs as you just have and rejects mainstream science from the National Science Academies, has no credibility with me. Footnote: ‘Present’ on your graph is 1950 by scientific convention, so your graph omits modern era warming from 1950 onward — which is most of it. If you knew that, you are a fraud. Why should anyone care if you think someone else is credible? Self induce Dunning-Kruger effect. You are a nobody, a scientific non-entity. Oooh get you. What’s your title? The central scrutiniser? The supreme arbiter? anyone that posts the nonsense you post is up for the ridicule you so richly deserve. I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. Why would we think you have any credibility? The oceans have ~1,000 X the heat content of the atmosphere, and contain ~60 X the CO2; yet you still believe that a small increase in atmospheric CO2 away from the death threshold for all plant life is of major concern!? Hunh!? You really should avoid the word ‘fraudulent;’ it’s very likely to stick! it’s a 50% increase in atm co2 since 1750. Atm co2 is now the highest in 15 million years And that CO2 has saved the planet from plant starvation. It is a totally and absolutely beneficial increase in CO2 from desperately low level. There is absolutely zero down-side from increasing CO2 to even double or triple what it is today. If you think there is then prove it. First step…. 1… provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or stumble and faceplant on your own BS. Graph is a well know established graph, from well established sources. It is not fraudulent is any way whatsoever. ! YOU ARE AN IGNORANT LIAR. You have 100% negative credibility. ! I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. You sound like the all-knowing Karnack of Johnny Carson fame. Sorry to tell you, that was a parody of what you are doing. Show another graph that isn’t fraudulent according to you. There should be plenty of them as you say “mainstream science from the National Science Academies” tells all. I didn’t post any fraudulent graphs. Cite the time stamp. You didn’t post any graphs, And most of what is in your links is provable FAKE by their own data. Planet is still only a tiny bump above the coldest period in 10,000 years. Be every thankful of that. And there is no evidence human CO2 caused that highly beneficial warming. You will prove that, by producing no evidence… Oh look, Beetroot agrees with me. There is no evidence that CO2 causes warming. In the NH the current temperature is probably about on par with 1930s’ Modern warming is nothing but a tiny dot at the end of the chart, level with the left hand end. WB – you obviously do not have a traditional earth science background. The following image may help you get the “modern warming” in perspective. The only questionable figures on this image are the 2050 and 2100 temperature estimates on the right, and even 2050 is not a problem for this planet as it has happened during the Eemian, which is like yesterday in earth history. I have a very traditional science education from a top northeastern US University, and I am very familiar with this graph you’ve posted. It shows a projection that by the end of this century, global temperatures could be higher than they were during the Eemian, 120,000 years ago. What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Nor does it do anything to communicate the effects of such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. You might benefit from a scientific view of the risks that climate change presents to humanity, here: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ The projections shown by the red dots are totally BOGUS and not based on anything but pure conjecture. I replied to your JUNK PROPAGANDA below. !! Showed it was a total load of bollocks backed by absolutely nothing that could be considered remotely scientific. Now.. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or FAIL yet again. Your credibility is now at negative105% You should ask for a refund for your science education. You don’t seem to have learnt anything at all in those years. ! You are still an ill-informed or nil-informed scientific non-entity. ! There has NOT been a rapid rise in temperature, current level is barely a degree or so above the coldest period in 10,000 years. ! rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia Bullshit. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Your evidence link is nothing but propaganda pap, It contains absolutely zero evidence of anything You climate.gov link is no better. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Or you could just keep posting links to nebulous zero-science propaganda sites, and lower your credibility to -200% Your first statement about rate of warming is totally unsupportable BS. !! There is no way past data is defined enough to show that. In fact, before manic data adjustments the period from 1900-1922 was about the same rate as from 1970 onwards And as YOU have shown many times, there is no empirical evidence at all that humans have caused any of the small amount of highly beneficial warming. You are one of the most MAL-INFORMED fools I have ever come across. !! Not only that, we know from the UAH data that the current warming is NOT because of human CO2,. It is from extra solar energy reaching the tropical oceans, expressing as El Nino spike/steps at semi-regular intervals. There is absolutely no evidence of any human causation. If you think there is, Use UAH data to show us where it is. Think for yourself, not petty regurgitations… if you can find a pair of operable brain cells. Why should I believe your climastrology sites? So you are a Denier. There is NO SCIENCE on those pages. Just nonsense projections from unvalidated computer games. Nothing to “DENY” because they are just fantasy. Warren, two things. Don’t engage.. so he can avoid posting any evidence… as always. ?? So he can post climate nonsense and get away with it ?? —– “I firmly believe CO2 is a GHG and warms the earth” Ahhh.. another anti-science AGW-cultist… you are not a skeptic. Perhaps you would like to try… and fail. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Oh look, “the hoff”, a silly AGW “believer” runs away presents zero empirical evidence WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN !! “No matter what facts you put in front of him” Beeton has not put forward any actual “facts”. Haven’t you been watching. Neither have you. ! I’m quite prepared to discuss actual scientific evidence. Beeton hasn’t produced any. You know the questions. ! thanks. Four things from me: 1) I did not know that wuwt had a “position” on co2. It’s hard to find any consistent position on anything among skeptics. 2) I rarely engage with Bnice for the reason you state 3) The research behind climate sensitivity estimates is extensive. I’ve seen analysis that shows Even with the lowest values found in the literature, climate change is a severe economic, health and safety risk to humanity, and only a full transition of the global economy to zero carbon emissions by 2050 can avoid very serious effects. 4) I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science. Unfortunately, exceptions like yourself are a rarity on wuwt. Warren, Skeptics are not a homogenous group, but we call ourselves skeptics for the specific reason that that our skepticism revolves around issues like the benefits of mitigation versus adaptation and the severity of alarm that is appropriate. Bnice is an outlier, a vocal minority if you will, but “Denier” remains an odious term which belongs in no civil discourse. Anthony Watts started this blog a long time ago, and his position is that CO2 is a GHG. That was oft stated in the early days of this forum, it has unfortunately not repeated recently. In the early days there were extensive articles with in depth scientific analysis by well known skeptics that showed conclusively that the GHE is real and that CO2 is a GHG. These articles tend to be few and far between these last few years, so we are left with more political articles than the early days which were hardcore science. Even just a basic understanding of Stephen-Boltzmann Law shows that if the GHE is not real and there are no GHG’s, the earth would be snowball earth except perhaps for a stripe around the equator. You are correct that the research behind climate sensitivity is extensive. In decades of research though, the range in sensitivity estimates hasn’t changed much, though more recent papers tend to the lower side, support for the upper range is diminishing rapidly. Estimates for direct effects (3.7w/m2 per doubling) have not changed at all, but the sum total with feedbacks continues to be in dispute, ranging from as low as 1.7 Deg per doubling to 3.0 with the lower end having far more support recently. That, however, isn’t what skeptics are most focused on. The endangerment findings that you find so troubling are predicated on output from models, which have been consistently wrong. They’ve run too hot for decades, all except one. They continue to produce a tropospheric hotspot which has for decades been the “fingerprint” of catastrophe, except it exists ONLY in models, not in real world observations. Second, having paid close attention to the IPCC reports since AR3, there is a disturbing difference between the science itself in the main report and the Summary for Policy Makers, with the latter political documents often unrelated to the actual science. We’ve even seen one lead author demand his name be taken off the SPM for its unjustified alarm. But as the IPCC reports have evolved, each one has been more political than the previous. Consider for example the 1.5 degree “limit”. Where did this number come from? What science underlies it? The answer is none. It was arrived at by “expert opinion” from a group of scientists who are clearly biased toward alarm. I cannot summarize for you the entirety of the skeptic side in a single post, its a very broad topic. But on the issue of alarm, I shall leave you with this: We’ve gone from 280ppm of CO2 to 430, not far off one doubling. During that time, on a global basis, the IPCC has found no discernable trend in hurricanes, floods, droughts or wildfires. The four horsemen of the apocalypse as Forbes put it. What conclusion can we draw from this? If we put the models aside and just focus on data, the lack of a trend over decades doesn’t mean 100% for certain that there is no cause for alarm. But it does raise an important question which I can tell you from 20 years of debating this topic, tends to draw insults and jeers from the alarmists rather than any sober discussion of the facts. The question is, if the earth’s climate is so sensitive, so prone to unleashing climate fury upon the planet, why is there no sign in the data, collected over decades, of the deleterious effects? How can he climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2? Further, as CO2’s effects are logarithmic (hence the practice of quoting sensitivity in Deg C per doubling) each additional ppm of CO2 has less effect than the one before it. So the best conclusion that we can draw based on the data is that catastrophic changes in weather are not only insensitive to CO2 increase, they get less sensitive to each additional ppm. I wrote this article for WUWT about 9 years ago. Its has since been moved to different servers a couple of times so the formatting is screwed up. The links are also broken for the most part as the IPCC has moved their stuff around a lot too. Yes it is AR5 and the most recent report is AR6, I did say it was a 9 year old article. But the conclusions are still clear and easily read. The reason that I share it with you here is that as of AR5, it was VERY CLEAR from the IPCC’s main report (in other words the actual science, not the SPM) that there is no cause for alarm. Climate Change comes in dead last in nearly every category in terms of what the major effects on the human condition are likely to be in the future. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/01/01/we-have-bigger-problems-than-climate-change-so-sayeth-ipcc-ar5/ In fact, Richard Tol, lead author on multiple iterations of the IPCC reports shows up in comments on this article. One of his comments pertains to his reason for withdrawing from the SPM of his own chapter. No need for you to take me at my word. You can read it for yourself. There is also no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2 in any IPCC creation. It is all just conjecture and supposition. Would you care to provide that empirical evidence. Or just ignore the fact that you can’t, and go on “believing” like a good little AGW-cultist A whole lot of regurg. but still no empirical scientific evidence. A big FAIL !! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Other than the most basic theory of climate science –the GHE– I find most of your implied call for no action or minimal action unsupported in the scientific literature. Eg: 1) The latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) estimates equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely between 2.5°C and 4.0°C and very likely between 2.0°C and 5.0°C. The best estimate for ECS remains at 3°C. In order to safeguard the atmosphere and climate, responsible risk management requires insuring against the more severe of possible outcomes, not the mean. That implies mitigation policy based on an ECS between 3 and 4, possibly 5. Using an ECS less than 3C would be irresponsible risk management, and gambling with earth’s life support system. 2) Some models have run ‘hot’, but of course the IPCC is fully aware of this, and considers the ensemble of models with and without the hot models included. At the end of the day, for AR6 the IPCC has decided not to increase the upper end of IPCC ECS estimates in AR5 — which after all are not based on models alone, but also on paleoclimate data, as well as current warming trends. 3) It is untrue to claim, as you do, that none of the impacts of climate change have shown up. Clearly they have, and they are so identified and documented by the IPCC as effects based on current data, not on modeling. 4) Also, it is flawed logic to claim, as you do that because some impacts of climate change are not yet showing statistical significance, that they should be dismissed from a threat assessment. Modeling is based on real data and the physical behavior of earths climate system, and many of the models do indeed accurately reproduce the current warming trend. Disregarding future impacts based on those models would be irresponsible. 5) In your last paragraph you say, “How can the climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2?” AR6 is replete with examples that make that an absurd claim. As I said earlier, each iteration of the IPCC reports had become more political than the previous. I spend little time these days on IPCC reports. If I delve into something I delve into the papers upon which the reports are supposedly based. I find little alarming in them. The IPCC is a UN construct, and like many UN constructs, corrupt to the core. Their purpose is to grow their organization, their funding, and their power. If they were to proclaim that there is no cause for alarm, they would instantly be out of jobs. An executive position at the UN pays on the order of $700K per year. The incentive for alarm is obvious. Hence my focus on the actual papers than their conclusions. Sensitivity in the range of 5.5 Deg C per doubling is pure garbage. If it was that high would would see it leaping out of the data. But we don’t, we can barely tease the warming signal out of natural variability. As for the impacts, I did not say none have shown up. Its getting warmer. It doesn’t matter which temperature series you want to look at, its getting warmer. UAH, RSS, HadCrut, etc it is warmer now that it was 100 years ago. No doubt about it. That doesn’t change the fact that there are no discernable trends in the exact things we should be most worried about. Tree lines moving north is real, and not at all alarming. More arable land, not alarming. Island atolls aren’t being swamped by sea level rise, they are getting larger. Agricultural output has sky rocketed, outpacing population increases without using more land. For every heat related excess death we are seeing 10+ lives saved from excess cold. If you look at nothing but negative effects, you have reason for alarm. If you look at ALL the effects, it turns out that there are a lot of positives. In fact, the heights of civilization all coincide with the Medieval, Roman and Minoan warming periods. In fact history books record them as climate optimums. You might be able to convince me that we’re as warm now as the Medieval warming period, but the Roman and Minoan warming periods were absolutely warmer than it is now. As for irresponsible risk management, allow me to point out two things: I’m going to have a little fun with bnice blow, you might want to follow along just to be amused. A little fun with your headless chook routine showing absolutely zero empirical evidence. RUN AWAY again.. post a load of irrelevant regurg… Hilarious. ! Making a compete joke of yourself ??? What a load of low-end kamal-speak. Absolute GIBBERISH !! Pertaining to absolutely nothing but the stupid opinions of a manic AGW -cultist. Andreas not Antonius. I should review more before hitting the post button. Again, just waffling irrelevant gibberish… and mal-information. …. with no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Why is that? The models are a load of unphysical garbage filled with errors and unproven suppositions. They are little more than computer games. IPCC can make all the estimates of ESC they want, but they are all based on models that don’t remotely represent the atmosphere. There is no evidence ESC is anything but zero. It is massively irresponsible to waste billions of dollars based on erroneous garbage models while destroying electricity grids and the environment. You still haven’t present one bit of peer-reviewed science to back up anything you have said. You cannot even say what I “deny” that you can present actual empirical science to back You have zero credibility, because you are also totally clueless what journal peer-review even means or does. Here is some peer-reviewed science do you DENY the result? 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ found tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Seems YOU ARE A DENIER under your own description. Hi Bnice200, thanks for posting that. So, after insisting that there is NO empirical evidence to show that CO2 has ANY warming effect, you’ve now posted evidence that falsifies your own assertion. Hoisted on your own petard as they say. If we are to believe the 8 Taiwanese engineers you cite, take them completely at their word, assume their calculations are 100% accurate, then CO2 in fact DOES have a warming effect. Per your cite, going from 100ppm to 400ppm has a warming effect of 0.3 Deg C. Which means according to YOUR cite, all the rubbish you have cluttered up the threads with about there being no empirical evidence to show that CO2 has any warming effect at all are rubbish. Crap. Bull sh*t. You’ve just admitted that there IS an effect. Its not zero. They will not be the first to suggest a very low sensitivity, nor will they be the last. The point is that it is not zero as you claim. They start out though by “tripling” CO2 concentration from 100 to 400 ppm. They appear to have a math problem, that is quadrupling, not tripling. Then they make the astounding claim that there’s no additional warming from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Well if there is measurable warming from 100 to 350, then NO warming from 350 to 400 is physically impossible. So what game did they play to arrive at that conclusion? Well, they limited the calculations to 5 years. So they got a number so small that they rounded it off to zero. The real world doesn’t end in 5 years. But bottom line is they showed that CO2 in fact does have an effect, and all your blathering is wrong. Want some more empirical evidence? Here is a real experiment. A 10 cm long tube with IR transparent windows at each end is filled with an artificial atmosphere with 2.6 % water vapour and 357 ppm of CO2. They shine a known IR source in one end, and measure exactly what comes out the other end. Then they double the CO2 concentration and do it again. Their conclusion? 0.054w/m2. Very small, but most definitely NOT zero, read it for yourself: http://www.john-daly.com/artifact.htm Now let me explain why that conclusion is WAY too low. To get an actual result that is accurate using this methodology, you’d have to build an apparatus the height of the troposphere. Not practical, but the point being that you’d need thousands of these 10 cm tubes end to end and the total effect would be cumulative. Secondly, there is no ocean in this experiment, or a whole lot of other things that exist in the real world. In the real world increased temps promote more evaporation into an atmosphere that can hold more water, which is also a GHG. Feedbacks are real. Thanks for playing along, your apology is accepted. David H. is partially right when he points to a warming effect due to CO2. It was shown in the referenced paper which is likely from the same cause as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper. https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/german-researcher-doubling-of-atmospheric-co2-causes-only-0-24-c The cause is the widening of the 15 µm absorption window for CO2. This effect was also mentioned in the work by Wijngaarden and Happer. The problem is this is only part of the story. There is also an induced cooling effect by CO2 which appears to be of about the same strength. I’ve mentioned this in the past. It is caused by the increase in IR radiation at the surface leading to additional evaporation and enhanced convection (first mention by Dr. William Gray). As a result, Bnice turns out to be correct. There is no warming from increases in CO2 even going back to 100 ppm. (we could see some warming at less than 100) The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. If you want to pick nits, CO2 has an absorption band in the downwelling solar radiance. At surface this completely get swamped by water vapour, but at high altitude and high latitude it is cold, very little water vapour. So in theory CO2 in fact has a cooling effect too. Fun fact, there are winds that blow high in the atmosphere over Antarctica that are warmer than the surface below. So the net effect of CO2 there is to intercept downwelling photons from the warm winds and then xfer the energy either by collision or emission. So the “greenhouse effect” is actually reversed in Antarctica. Keep that in mind when you see some warming event in Antarctica being blamed on CO2. “Net positive feedback.” Again, a load of baseless supposition. Never proven. And if there is no CO2 signal , there is no feedback. So…. Still waiting for you to present some empirical scientific evidence of CO2 warming the atmosphere. All you have so far is empty waffle.. The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. Sorry, this is simply not true. You are missing the effects of saturation and convection. The increase in water vapor only occurs low in the atmosphere where all the energy available to H2O is already being absorbed, aka saturation. Can’t cause any warming there. The increase has the added effect of increasing buoyancy. This ends up driving convective currents higher into the colder troposphere which increases condensation. As a result you have less residual water vapor exactly where saturation is no longer in effect. This occurs primarily in the Tropics and then is carried by the Hadley circulation to the higher latitudes. The reduced water vapor ends up allowing more energy to radiate to space thus a cooling effect. The extra energy that was captured low in the atmosphere due to the widening of the absorption window is basically what is sent high in the troposphere as latent heat of the extra evaporation. This is the energy that now has an easier time getting to space. This is one of the non-obvious effects that have fooled most scientists, so don’t feel bad. There are more. “as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper.” Which for a small increase in CO2 in the last 100 or so years would lead to a totally immeasurable amount, totally swamped by natural variability. Poor Hoff.. the rabid AGW-cultist. ! Doesn’t understand the words “ no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm.” Then an experiment that cuts out convection, conduction and air movement so it no longer even remotely resembles the atmosphere. How much more stupid can you get !! And a call to the fallacy of WV feedback A complete FAIL !! It was not an experiment. It was a model. Its in the first effing paragraph of the description, FFS. You know what? Eff off. I’m putting you back on ignore. Calling ME a rabid AGW cultist is as ignorant and insult as one can get. I’ve authored well over a dozen articles for WUWT challenging the entire CAGW premise. I’ve dissected IPCC reports, I wrote damning articles calling out the hypocrisy in the leaked AR5 pre print which then disappeared from the final version. I’ve written for other skeptic forums, I have in fact risked my career by publicly refuting the CAGW thesis as I write under my own name. Do you have the guts to write under your own name? I am betting you do not. You’re just a troll whose only argument is to say anything that s shown to you is invalid. You clutter up threads with the same blather over and over. You are convincing no one except perhaps yourself. I actually feel rather sorry for you. Set/Bnice=Ignore The fact that you think an enclosed tube in any way represents the atmosphere, really does indicate the low level of your scientific understanding. Apparently you missed the entire part of the post where I explained exactly that? Do the words you disagree with just disappear while you are reading them? Or do you read them and then delete them from your brain? Ask me if I care about your stupid labels, shillboi. “So you are a Denier.” So you are a troll. I’m also a denier. Now you just have to figure out what I deny. Good luck! That is hate speach. What’s not accurate about this? “I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science” Which is a totally meaningless description when you are totally incapable of producing any peer-reviewed science. If you say I “deny” something you must be able to produce precise empirically based science to prove the thing you say I deny. So far you have failed absolutely and completely You have also shown that you are totally clueless what “peer-review” actually is. !! You are just a mouth, with no brain driving it. One of the issues that I have noticed with “traditional science education” is a lack of teaching of “traditional earth science”. In my day, there was a School of Applied Geology. That faculty no longer exists, and geology is a bit player in the school of Environmental Science. This lack of traditional earth science teaching and understanding leads to statements such as: What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Are you certain that is the case? NASA only goes back to 1880. The only other long term record is that for Central England which goes back to the 1600’s, but the data integrity is often questioned. The next alternative are temperature estimates from ice cores, with data points +/- a thousand years. Having another look at the CET data, it seems that a similar warming rate may have happened during the 1700’s. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature What do you find in the links that you disagree with? If so, why? Links aren’t working.. Both links work for me. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no data provided on any of your links to support this statement. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: ” The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 “ go back to the link and read footnote 1. You love your propaganda pap, don’t you beetroot. Quite pathetic that you think it is actual science, though !!. Not surprised that you can’t tell the difference between a bald-faced LIE, and actual science though. Let’s watch your squirm away in avoidance.. yet again… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Pre data adjustment…. graph didn’t attach…. And according to GISP data there have been several periods in the Holocene where warming was just as steep over a much large increase than current. Note, according to Mann the bottom of the current warming starts in 1850, so the end of the graph would be around the 1930s, very similar temperatures to now. My issue is with the claim that current (global) warming rates (ie 1960 to present) of about 0.24 DegC/decade is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no forensic method available to estimate such rates for a ~60 year period prior to about 1880. It rings my sciency alarm bells. BTW, I’m with you on nuclear! There is plenty of scientific literature explaining how proxy data,with error bars, allow for this determination. The NASA footnote cites AR6 Except you didn’t produce it. We can assume you have never read it while thinking. Just swallowed the nonsense hook line and sinker. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: You do realize that AR6 conclusions are based solely upon correlations and not causation don’t you? Again, you say you are trained in science, yet you use correlation as your proof? That is not scientific! I don’t believe you have the qualifications or competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the body of peer reviewed science. You are obviously totally lacking in any qualifications or scientific education. What you “believe” is totally irrelevant and has well below zero credibility. There is not data provided anywhere. it is all just mindless propaganda. This is what beetroot builds his case on.. NON-science nonsense. I have replied to this propaganda nonsense further down. That you seem to think it contains anything remotely scientific is a very sad indictment of the your education in science. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. From your NASA link : Takeaways While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. … … The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. [ Reference 1 ] The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. [ Reference 1 ] … … References References 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary OK, so it goes from a headline precise “in the past 10,000 years” to a more vague “over many recent millennia” in the main text, and just provides a reference to the (112 page PDF file) AR6 WG-I assessment report’s “Technical Summary” chapter. . In the “Introduction” to the TS there is a “Selected Updates and/or New Results since AR5” sub-section, in which we find (on page 41, bold in the original, underlining added by me) : Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. (Box TS.2, Section TS.2) The IPCC AR6 WG-I TS document referenced by the NASA webpage says “the last 2000 years”, not 10,000. Attached at the end of this post is a screenshot of panel a of Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1, which can be found on page 61. URL to IPCC original : https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/technical-summary/ts-ccbox-1-figure-1/ You will note that it repeats the “in a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years” number, neither “10,000” nor “many (recent) millennia”. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. . Your NASA “supporting evidence” link does not actually support your parroting of its “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Datasets with resolutions of “centuries” cannot be used to calculate “rates of warming” for periods of decades (/ “50 years”). Please try again. I Said “millennia”. 2000 is two millennia. This is lame even for you, shillboi. Mark had the receipts and this is all you can manage. Mark has no idea what data NASA has. Until he discusses with NASA, or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn, he hasn’t debunked anything. I trust NASA, not armchair deniers. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. Thanks for your forensic work Mark. It is a sad day when NASA allows unverified statements on their websites. ﻿ Nice write up Mark. One of the first things that triggered my BS meter was reading AR4 and coming across a value and wondering where it came from. The reference would be to a previous AR which would then reference a paper which would then reference another paper which would inevitably be behind a paywall. Accept their number or spend a fortune finding out where it came from. Why the obvious effort to shroud the source of a value used across multiple AR’s? I discovered that other people were asking the same questions and getting the run around. The second was the steadfast refusal to share data and methods. You’ll just try and find something wrong with it complained Hanson. Well isn’t that the whole point of science? Trying to find errors? The fate of humanity lies in the balance and these clowns are afraid we’ll find errors? If we did find errors, would that not be a cause for celebration, the world not ending after all? Or if we didn’t find errors it would prove them right, isn’t that what they want, for us to believe them? I got banned from multiple “science” sites for asking those questions. NASA global data back to 1850 is a manically distorted fabrication of homogenised urban heat effect surface data,. It is totally meaningless as a measure of global temperature change “such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. “ NONE of which actually exist in real data, except the highly beneficial temperature rise since the LIA. Warmth enhances health. 10X more people die from cold as from heat, life expectancy has increased massively due to warming and the products and use of fossil fuels. Environment.. the whole planet is much greener.. is that a bad thing. Only thing destroying the environment is wind and solar factories. Migration patterns are never set in stone. No trend in droughts.. Cold causes more droughts than warmth does. No trend (maybe slightly downwards) in storms or cyclones/hurricanes except the silly naming thereof. No increase in disasters, except where people build on flood plains etc. Infrastructure .. nope… you have nothing. So.. just another load of fake mantra pap from you. ! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. How many years does each dot on the graph cover? How do you determine the rate of change when a single point covers a century or a millennia. If you had a proper science education, you would know how to interpret time series graphs. Apparently you missed that day at school! Beetroot doesn’t seem to have any science background whatsoever !! And he has to resort to spamming to prop up his lies. Oh dear…the beetroot falls for on-line propaganda pap, yet again !! And there it is. As always the warmists ultimately rely on the “argument from authority” fallacious position rather than providing evidence that supports their claims. They rather believe that there are experts who can be relied on to tell them what the facts are because that’s what they are told by – you know -really smart people. For Mr. Beeton’s information, many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent. You cannot claim to be well educated on a subject unless you’ve thoroughly researched and considered all sides. I’ve only ever seen what I believe to be truly objective research on the climate change issue from what are called skeptics. “many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent.” So, since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research, every one of the 270 scientific institutions in the world, all University textbooks on Atmospheric Physics, and nearly every single researching climate scientist in the world contradict Deniers — who have no consistent theory to explain the warming of the planet — I consider your position to be untenable in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research Liar. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change Agree…. so what… because they get funding NOT ONE OF THEM provides scientific evidence that it does. If you think one does, then point to the exact one. That means you will have to read them all to find it exists… .. instead of posting links you are totally clueless about.. Modelled crap does not count. Noted, yet again you RUN AWAY. so funny to watch your headless chicken routine. 🙂 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. “problematic relationship with facts” And you have ZERO or negative relationship with facts. !! You run and hide from them. ! Noted that YET AGAIN you are totally incapable of supporting the very basis of your cult-religion Hilarious headless chicken routines to avoid the fact. You have NEVER read a book on Atmospheric Physics, you do not have a capability to understand it. The scientific incompetence is totally YOURS. Prove me correct , yet again.. !! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Your credibility is now at negative 220% Try again.. see if you can present something with any credibility.. or FAIL ! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. So just an appeal to “more and bigger” authorities? Perhaps you are unaware that all those scientific institutions represent mostly academic researchers highly dependent on massive government grants for their livelihood and those grants only go to those who support the approved narrative. Are you, by chance, one of them? You don’t even seem to know how bogus the 99% [97%] consensus argument is. You need to read more widely. He’s just regurgitating the talking points he’s been handed. “in the face of overwhelming evidence” You haven’t produced any actual scientific evidence. !! 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. You can DENY or ignore.. We know who the real “deniers” are. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. There is part of your problem. You have obviously not done a deep dive into your science education. Have you never been taught something by a professor and found it in error. Yet it has been propagated to many students through booksand papers the professor has written. How many text books still contain the Micheal Mann debunked hockey stick? As a student if you are taught this and never research it depth, you’ll never know it is based on suspect statistics. How many textbooks can you find that show empirical data substantiating the effective warming potential of CO2 as a cold body compared to the surface? How many textbooks deal with the subject using calculus to integrate the variations in day, month, annual orbital equations? How many just use averages and time series correlation? How many have a functional relationship between CO2 and surface temperature rather than just graphical time series? Climate science has not progressed into science yet. That is what makes me skeptical. Like it or not climate science is still at the alchemy stage of development still trumpeting that “We have found the way to make CO2 the control knob”! Youve now convincingly demonstrated you have neither the qualifications nor competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the peer reviewed scientific literature. You know absolutely NOTHING about peer-review, do you. ! Totally ignorant as to what it even means. You are LYING about having ever done any science. 100 scientists can agree with me, but it only take 1 to prove I am wrong. Who said that, again? Even if a ‘green’ future is necessary there are two fallacies in place. (1) Lack of due process (2) You can’t throw a switch, which, of course, you might learn with due process. No fallacies required. First, all climate policy are and must be carried out constitutionally by legislation or by constitutional executive orders. Second, no policymakers advocate ‘throwing a switch’. Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. But fallacies are all you have.! There is no transition underway in any country that isn’t destroying it economy World fossil fuel use remains around 80% of world energy use, wind and solar are a tiny slice, barely visible on the graph below. There is absolutely zero need to move away from fossil fuels to unreliable, erratic, intermittent parasitic low-integrity energies like wind and solar. Yes there is a transition, well underway in the world, including the US, EU, Japan, and China. EVs are in production, and more in development, 80% of new power generation capacity being installed is solar wind or nuclear, and funding and incentives from legislation is already helping to build out infrastructure. In addition, 42 countries are considering, or already have in place, a carbon tax. Also, this year the EU has implemented a new border carbon adjustment mechanism that will incentivize trade with countries that have a carbon tax. Lots happening, so you need to pay attention if you want to have credibility in your comments. Data says otherwise. Fossil fuel growth continues to outstrip wind and solar That 80% is really less than 20% when considering capacity factors.. sorry if you are too dumb to realise that. The largest countries in the world continue to massively increase their fossil fuel energy use. Countries CANNOT survive or progress without fossil fuels.. period. ! You rely totally on them every day of your pitiful existence. Drive a battery car yet, beetman? If no, you’re a hypocrite. If yes, you’re a sucker. so that makes you….uneducated Noted , yet again, the total lack of anything remotely related to scientific evidence. You ran away from answering, just like all the other AGW shills. I wonder if he parks and charges his pretend EV in an attached garage. He is dumb enough to do that. ! BOOM! Goes the Chinese EV. Have you come to grips with the fact that indeed global temperatures are rising at the fastest rate in millennia? “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Spamming is all you got in the tank, shillboi. Totally destroyed above. They are just regurgitated propaganda fakery with zero scientific content. I meant “below” Exactly — and he can’t even regurgitate the 97% propaganda correctly.

Each and every scheme a scam. https://www.youtube.com/@Bernie-is-Artemis Marxist. …. and a completely indoctrinated gormless twit. ! …the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. This is pure fantasy. Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions. Look at the various COPs and at progress (or lack of it) on the Paris agreements. The plain fact is, no-one outside of the English speaking countries and Germany has taken global warming seriously, and the countries that have tried to reduce their emissions from electricity generation are right now seeing themselves approaching the cliff of intermittency. And not liking it, getting very alarmed, and getting ready for U-turns. As will happen in February in the US. The other countries are just growing their economies as fast as possible, and letting emissions and coal use go where they may. “Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions”. China’s goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. and they are well on their way,,ahead of most countries including the US. Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China. wind and solar in China are barely visible in the energy chart They now have a working pebble bed nuclear, those will expand rapidly, and wind and solar will be left to rot. ! Not one nation has a chance of meeting their FAKE goals. Wind and solar make up a very small part of China’s energy usage, they have had hydro for a long time. EV’s in China make sense, crowded huge cities… anything is better than those old 2 cycle motor bikes., and the COAL fired power they will run is well out of the cities. Places like USA and America EVs are basically just a low-level second car or virtue-seeking of very little actual use. Plans, stated to fool twits like you and your mates.. works every time… … yet their use of coal grows year one year. The others are just gimmicks to fool the western world into sticking with the idiotic net-zero plan to destroy their manufacturing bases. It will fail in the USA now Trump is in, because he will aim fossil fuel self-dependency in a very short time 😆 “dropping by more than 80% by 2060.” By then, all their current coal fired power stations will be still running at high efficiency. Current wind and solar will have ceased to function and be in scrap heaps or left to rot. Why always portray new renewable energy sources with capacity rather than actual production of energy? World wide renewable energy production is about 20% of stated capacity. Combined renewable wind and solar with 100 Giga-watts of capacity over time have average output of about 20 Giga-watts of energy. Because it is the only way they can keep the hoax alive. shillboi — praising his marxist masters and earning his keep. So Warren, why are you using FF every day? And I bet you have no solar panels on the roof. If you are going to talk the talk then you better walk the walk. Do not be a hypocrite. So Jim, do you need to read this in my post? “ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway” I’m doing my share — including lobbying my Congressional representative and Senators to pass climate legislation. What are you doing, Jim? “I’m doing my share” Yep, you continue to use fossil fuels every second of every day. Trump is in now.. All this anti-CO2 nonsense will disappear. Drill baby, drill ! 🙂 ““ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway”” 1… NOT underway, fossil fuels % is holding steady and is still BY FAR the main energy supply 2… Politically and idiotology based wishful thinking and propaganda. The Anti-CO2 nonsense will be dead and buried by 2050. Harold the Organic Chemist Says ATTN: Warren RE: CO2 Does Not Cause Warming Of Air. To refresh your memory, shown below in the graphic are plots of temperatures from the weather station at Furnace Creek in Death Valley from 1922 to 2001. In 1922, the concentration of CO2 was 303 ppmv (0.6 g of CO2/ cu. m. of air), and, by 2001 it had increased to 371 ppmv (0.7 g/cu. m. of air), but there was no corresponding increase in the air temperature. The reason for no temperature increase is quite simple: There is too little CO2 in the air. At the MLO in Hawaii, the current concentration of CO2 in dry air is 422 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has 0.8 g of CO2 and a mass of 1.29 kg at STP. This small amount of CO2 can heat up such a large mass of air by a very small amount if at all. I remined you that the heavy industries and heavy transportation systems will always use enormous amounts of fossil fuels. It is now winter in the Northern Hemisphere and huge amounts of fossil fuels will be used for space heating. NB: The graphic was obtained from the late Joh Daly’s website: “Still Waiting For Greenhouse” available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow “What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” Richard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Climate “Science” | Dr. Richard Lindzen | Jordan B Peterson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVSrTZDopM Beetroot relies absolutely and completely on the many things that use fossil fuels. He could never exist without them. Even beetroots need CO2 to grow.. Don’t be too hard on the poor baby, bnice! He’s so delusional that he actually believes that a trace gas has more control over our climate than oceanic cycles and currents, or the Sun! Think how embarrassing it is going to be for him when the adults in his life finally have to explain reality to him! Some are made to be fools! No, Mr. Beeton, you are wrong. There is absolutely no need to bankrupt economies in fear of global warming. A warmer Earth would be an entirely beneficial thing. Historically, the Earth has been warmer than today for 99% of the last 240,000,000 years. We are currently in a Great Ice Age. The coldest point in geologic history was a mere 20,000 years ago, a blip in geologic time. Feigned ignorance of these facts is deliberate abuse of science. No preceding period or epoch with a warmer climate was detrimental to life. On the contrary, life was abundant in past warmth, more abundant, widespread, bio-diverse, and productive than today. All human endeavors also benefit from warmth, including agriculture. The warmest climes are the best for farming, ranching, forestry, and horticulture. That’s a known fact. And CO2 increases yields of all the above. Production of food, clothing, and shelter increase with increasing warmth. The basic needs for human survival correlate. AI, on the other hand, is not needed at all, provides no survival necessity, is a toy, a useless indulgence, and is in fact a hazard to human survival and the well-being of all life. Nope. The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good. But if not done, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen. Governments are moving ahead, including in the US. You may not like it, but the energy transition is underway “…, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen….” where are your “costs” and “bad effects” Put up or SHUT UP ! Read and be educated: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ “Scientists predict ” you can’t show any of your imaginary effects are happening . But just Beet on . Still only find nebulous propaganda pap.. that is just sad. Nothing on that page has a single bit of scientific credibility whatsoever. U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy. Climate Changes Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond Based on fake unvalidated models.. ie scientific BS. btw, the climate has ALWAYS changed over time, so I’m assuming they mean the fallacy of human-based CO2 warming. Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. More Droughts and Heat Waves No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. Longer Wildfire Season Wildfires in the USA consumed far larger areas in the 1930s Yet another piece of fakery based on unvalidated models. Changes in Precipitation Patterns Have happened throughout history, no evidence human causes them except local land use. Frost-Free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen GREAT NEWS for farmers and food supply, but still based on unvalidated models. Global Temperatures Will Continue to Rise Again, based on unvalidated models based on unproven erroneous assumptions. Arctic Is Very Likely to Become Ice-Free More model based BS, Arctic has been stable for last 15 years after recovering from an extreme peak in 1979. Is still far above the extent for most of the last 10,000 years All just propaganda pap for the low-IQ ignorant AGW-cultist. And you still put it forward as “evidence” !!! Really You have well below zero credibility !! Lets see if you can provide some precise evidence rather than this sort of nonsense and mantra pap. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow. You are DELUDED and brain-hosed, until all that is left in your skull is a sickly green ooze. President Donald Trump will put an end to this energy transition nonsense by ending the billion dollars of subsidies for wind an solar. Legislation is required to change US energy policy. At the moment, the Republican margin in the House is razor thin, and they are so fractured, they can’t get anything done. in two years, the other party will likely be back in power in the House and the energy transition will continue . You think Trump can’t find away around the green mess that stops progress. Great to see you so against democracy….. you must be a marxist or a moron. ! And you are even more deluded than I thought. ! Only transition in the USA has been from coal to GAS. DRILL BABY DRILL. Trump flipped 4 Senate seats at the last election. He could easily flip a few more in two years time. Probably had 3 more if the marxo-democrats didn’t count “ballots” for week on end. “Governments are moving ahead, including in the US.” Drill Baby DRILL !! cheaper cleaner energy Liar. “The wind and sun are free!” — Nitpick Nick Stokes Over their short life time from mining to disposal, wind and solar are one of the most polluting forms of electricity there is. The amount of mining and highly toxic chemicals used in their production is horrendous. They then decimate whole environments, farmland and avian critters in their installation and use. Then at end of their short life have to be disposed of in dump sites, leave huge lumps of concrete in the ground And they are not clean! Oh dear still falling for that furphy. So MAL-EDUCATED and gullible. SOLAR DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT Are you so dumb that you don’t realise that? It is almost totally absent at peak electricity usage. All it is is a parasitic supply available only when the sun shines. Everywhere that wind and solar infect the grid.. …. electricity prices SKYROCKET. ! And you STILL haven’t answered the question… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. OK, shillboi, see if you can answer this: What material is vital for the production of steel, glass, silicon, etc. from raw ores? And the IEA is a much bigger liar than you. N.B. shillboi ran away from answering. The answer is coal and petroleum. You quote the International Energy Agency? Try finding a credible source. You are deep into your Denial Silo — denial of peer reviewed science, now denial of reliable sources, and embrace of junk science. Another moronic comment from the beetroot. https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Is-Cheapest-Energy-Source-Says-IEA.html It is also BY FAR the most polluting of all electricity supply options. It’s truly one of the most filthy industrial processes ever invented. The mining, acid leaching, high tonnage coal use for heat treatment and smelting with associated fumes and silicosis disease from dusts and much more makes solar manufacturing one of the filthiest processes ever. It costs 3x more to recycle than landfill, so recycling is nearly non-existent. The toxic heavy metals leach out over time. The first step in cleaning silica to produce metallurgical grade silicon is to rinse it with a mixture of one part acid to one part water This process is called acid leaching and is used to remove impurities such as iron, aluminium, and calcium from the silica. The purified silica is then heated with carbon in the form of coal or charcoal in an electrode arc furnace at a temperature of 1500-2000°C to produce metallurgical grade silicon that is 98% pure.. Some of the solvents used are hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid possibly in combination with each other as a solvent for purification of MG-Si. You are POLLUTION WORSHIPPER….. disgusting !! You are absolutely correct, silicon wafer production is not an easy task. Bullshit, from a bullshitter. “The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good“ Which is why electricity prices SKYROCKET everywhere the infection of wind and solar gets too big. 😉 New AI in the USA will mean a HUGE increase in GAS, and nuclear… … and coal is also likely to make a big resurgence. Wind and solar are totally useless for this purpose. It is neither cheaper nor is it cleaner. So Beeton is gaslighting? Who could have ever guessed? That is a categorically false statement. You are ignoring reality. Its is totally TRUE. You are just too dumb to realise you are doing it. From the electronic bible… The iron shall lie down with the lamp Climate change is not a problem, they have a crisis of faith Running an industrial society on wind and solar will require science fiction level storage, something with the performance of Robert Heinlein’s Shipstones. A major plot element in “Friday” was that the trade secret was so valuable the various factions of the Shipstone Trust run that fictional society. A note to various investment companies:it is fiction. Thanks for the Heinlein reference. I was not aware of that when I mentioned that AI would require dependable energy “in science-fiction-like quantities.” “These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.” Really? I kinda doubt it- other than some rare moments. I don’t know- somebody here can nail it down. It is actually about correct. Go to https://ourworldindata.org/energy Scroll down to the selection boxes about half way down, and click “Electricity Mix” Find the graph which has a tab saying “edit countries and regions”, deselect ‘World’ and select the country you want to look at. You should get a chart where you can read of the values for each type of electricity supply, and be able to do some quick calculation. Bear in mind though… both the UK and Germany are teetering on the edge of collapse energy-wise and are destroying all their manufacturing base because of very high electricity prices. They are on their way to third world status. Anglo-Saxons are practically there … Practically, but.., ‘Strained’ Keir Starmer badly needs holiday, his friends say as they reveal PM is suffering from the ‘relentless strain’ of the job https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14217547/Strained-Keir-Starmer-badly-needs-holiday.html Snowflake PM For the UK, number is actually 43% https://www.cladcodecking.co.uk/blog/post/renewable-energy-percentage-uk and for Germany 52% https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/renewables-cover-more-half-germanys-electricity-demand-first-time-year#:~:text=Clean%20Energy%20Wire,-, according to these two sources. Even if these numbers are too high, the wind and solar contribution is large enough to have put both countries in jeopardy from Dunkelflaute in November and again in the past 10 days, after I wrote the piece. There is a very simple solution to our energy conundrum, we know big tech, AI and related industries need outrageous amounts of power. If we want a reliable and plentiful source of energy we put them last in line for the power. In other words if there is a danger of a brown out or black out they are the first to have to cut back. The health and wellbeing of the citizen comes before anything else. If we demanded this new fossil fuel and nuclear generators would start popping up everywhere and the big tech/AI guys would be standing in line to help finance them. As for the government and outfits like Blackrock they can go to hell. We don’t much care what they think. Also, maybe, those with the larger demand should pay more per unit because they’re putting a strain on the system. Yes, they should pay more. In Virginia, the legislature is considering changing the cost allocation formula to put more of the burden on data centers instead of spreading the costs across all rate payers. Is that the Virginia that plans to import lots of coal, gas and nuclear powered electricity from out of state ?? Virginia is basically surrounded by Republican states. I hope they say.. “If you want the data centre, the you provide the electricity for it.” That will force Virginia to build new COAL, GAS or NUCLEAR power stations. That would be fun to watch 🙂 Or, require the data centers to build their own power plant. Joseph, I don’t want them treated different in any way so long as they see to it that new fossil fuel and nuclear generators are built. I would hope that since they are so dependent on reliable and available energy that they would build plenty for all of us. Germany and UK are moving steadily toward economic oblivion. BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen are all facing losses with massive slump in profitability. It is not possible to combine 2,500kg of exotic materials in a way that makes any motor vehicle suitable for the masses. They are creating engineering monstrosities unfit for purpose. A motor vehicle weighing 2,500kg capable of carry 4 people and luggage – say 500kg payload. The Ford Model T weighed 750kg and could transport 750kg if needed. It was a useful vehicle. . Great for woke virtue-seeking though !! “AMD’s new series scales from eight cores up to the $14,813 192-core / 384-thread EPYC 9965, a 500W behemoth that leverages TSMC’s 3nm node for the ultimate in compute density with dense Zen 5c cores.” A building full of these for a super-computer will require several nuclear generators Quick…. build the solar farm to drive it. 😉 Conventional data centers consume about 300-400 watts per sq ft. AI will increase that number 3x or 4x, or more. And that will require solid reliable electricity supply Are you ADVOCATING GAS or Nuclear ? Even a nil-educated monkey like you must know that wind and solar can never provide. He is the co-founder of the Prince William Virginia Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby and teaches the science of energy and climate change to continuing education students in Northern Virginia. Is this you ? That’s a collection of uneducated brain-washed students in the making !! No hope for their future , thanks to this low level indoctrination. Really sad. The IEA estimates that data centres total electricity consumption could reach the equivalent of the electricity consumption of Japan by 2026. IEA ‘Electricity 2024 Analysis and forecast to 2026’ (Jan 2024) Ok. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind. Or, investors should recognize that an AI stock market bubble is growing and will eventually burst. I want to put my money into self-driving cars! Then sell them to gullible Democrats and AGW-cultists. 🙂 What could possibly go wrong !! 😉 The future of AI investments was outside the scope of my piece. See this Goldman Sachs report, in particular the comments by Acemoglu and Covello https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai–too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at?ref=wheresyoured.at Half of what most people think about AI is true and the other half not. The true part is that it is artificial. As for renewable, green, net zero, climate protecting, sustainable, energy systems, the only true part is that they are tenuously connected somehow to the idea of energy.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) stands against other best edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts. Tech stocks have definitely grabbed the spotlight in the tech world, especially with the rise of generative AI. But there’s more to the sector that could be worth investors’ attention. Edge computing, for example, is another area within tech that’s primed for significant growth. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, edge computing aims to bring computing power closer to where data is generated instead of relying solely on centralized cloud systems. Sometimes called the “Third Act of the Internet” by the Linux Foundation, edge computing changes the game by moving data storage and processing closer to local network points. This shift is a major step in how we handle and interact with information. A new forecast from the IDC, global spending on edge computing is projected to hit $228 billion in 2024, reflecting a 14% increase from 2023. This figure covers combined spending by enterprises and service providers on hardware, software, professional services, and provisioned services for edge solutions. The forecast predicts continued strong growth through 2028, with spending expected to approach $378 billion, driven by a robust double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This growth is driven by the increasing demand for localized network infrastructure and computing power, fueled by the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT)—a network of connected devices. As more data is generated at the endpoints, the traditional network structure faces more strain. The rollout of 5G, which offers higher bandwidth and the ability to support more connected devices, is boosting IoT and driving the need for edge computing. At the same time, AI-optimized processors are providing the computing power necessary to expand the use of edge systems. The automotive industry is a great example of how edge computing and AI are driving rapid advancements. As cars increasingly adopt self-driving features, these technologies have become crucial for making real-time decisions and responses. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market, valued at $10.11 billion in 2023, is expected to grow from $13.66 billion in 2024 to a staggering $181.96 billion by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 38.2%. This rapid expansion is driven by the increasing adoption of edge devices, such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras, as well as computational infrastructure enabling real-time data analysis at the source. Similarly, PwC had predicted that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, rising from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion in 2024. This growth is fueled by the ability of localized data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and deliver storage and computational power closer to end-users. To create our list of the top edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts, we reviewed various stock screeners and ETFs, selecting companies based on their upside potential as of December 17. The stocks are ranked by their average upside potential, from lowest to highest, according to price targets. We also included data on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks, based on Insider Monkey’s Q3 hedge fund data. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An engineer typing on a computer, developing the latest cybersecurity application. Average Analyst Upside: 10.83% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) specializes in developing, designing, and marketing enterprise software, offering services such as threat prevention, web security, security management, and software-defined protection. The company has also enhanced its Harmony SASE offering by integrating its proprietary SD-WAN and IoT security capabilities, streamlining the management of secure access service edge solutions. In Q3 2024, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) introduced its AI-powered Quantum Firewall R82 and reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $635 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 9% to $2.25, while subscription revenue grew by 12%. Additionally, the company’s $186 million acquisition of Cyberint is expected to bolster its security operations capabilities. Following these results, Barclays revised its outlook on Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP), lowering its price target from $210 to $200 but maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. Barclays predicts high single-digit growth for Q4 2024, reflecting the inclusion of delayed deals, while setting expectations for approximately 5% growth in FY 2025, noting tougher year-over-year comparisons for Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP). Ariel Global Fund stated the following regarding Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Israeli based provider of products for information technology security, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) also advanced following solid quarterly earnings results. Double-digit billings growth was particularly strong across geographies. Consumers appear to be adopting more pillars of Check Point’s platform and engaging in larger strategic commitments with Infinity and Quantum Force. The company also announced the appointment of new CEO Nadav Zafrir, whose reputation is well established in the cyber community. Meanwhile, Check Point continues to be an astute steward of capital, pursuing organic growth and utilizing surplus cash to return capital to shareholders. We continue to favor the company’s exposure to the fast-growing cloud security market and its industry leading profitability.” Overall, CHKP ranks 9th on our list of best edge computing stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CHKP, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CHKP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a "tale of two halves," where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps. Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year. A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. To compile the list of 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years, we applied a consensus approach. We sifted through recent articles to get an aggregated list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Funds: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the best stock to buy and hold for 3 years. What started as an online book-selling venture in the 1990s is now a major e-commerce, streaming, and cloud technology giant. Over the past 5 years, the company has grown its top and bottom line by 18% and 34%, respectively.

Advertising revenues grew 20%, which decelerated a bit from prior quarters as well. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a "tale of two halves," where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps. Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year.

We sifted through recent articles to get an aggregated list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Some of the core offerings by the company include productivity software including Microsoft Office and Azure, the Windows operating system, and Gaming devices such as Xbox consoles. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is leading the AI transformation through its intelligent cloud, Azure, and its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Copilot. During the fiscal first quarter results of 2025, the company generated $65.6 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. The growth was on the back of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. The segment was driven by Azure which led the server products and cloud services revenue to increase 23%. Management noted that Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, up more than 80% year-over-year. In addition to its cloud business, the AI business is taking significant leaps forward. Management during the call highlighted that its AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, making it the fastest business to reach the milestone in Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) history. On November 17, the company announced that it is collaborating with Accenture and Avanade to help businesses transform their operations using advanced technologies like generative AI and Microsoft’s Copilot tools. The partnership is expected to further enhance its product offerings, increasing customer engagement and driving financial growth for the company. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top detractor in the third quarter following a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that featured inline operating metrics but mixed guidance. Positively, the company reported strong revenue (+15%) and earnings growth (+10%), powered by Azure (+30%), and operating margins of 43%. Guidance however calls for lower than expected fiscal first quarter Azure revenue as infrastructure constraints limit growth, and higher capital expenditures throughout the company’s fiscal 2025 to alleviate these constraints. The company expects growth to reaccelerate in the back half of fiscal 2025 as more AI capacity comes online. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company has also developed a family of large language models (LLMs) known as Gemini. These models are integral to the Gemini chatbot and enhance various AI features within Google Search.

Title: $73 Million Exodus: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Suffers Record-Breaking Outflow
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/73-million-exodus-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-suffers-record-breaking-outflow/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:30:30Z
Full Content:
A major player in the cryptocurrency market found itself on an unusual side of history after experiencing its largest outflows in months. The leading asset manager BlackRock ended the inflow streak of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund after recording a $72.7 million worth of outflow on December 20. Data showed that BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) witnessed the largest outflow since it was launched in January this year. According to Farside Investors, the global asset manager’s Bitcoin ETF posted an outflow of 72.7 million in December, the highest on record for IBIT. They added that this came a day after IBIT registered zero flows, making investors anxious about the exchange-traded fund. IBIT is not alone as fellow ETF issuer Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also hit an all-time high outflow of $208.5 million on December 19, a day before IBIT hit the same ordeal. Analysts said that the following day, December 20, FBTC recorded another outflow of about $71.9 million, making the EFT suffer a two-day outflow streak. IBIT and FBTC are among the top performing exchange-traded funds in the United States. The ETF issuers were ranked 1 and 2 among the top 25 ETFs in terms of assets after one month in the market. Market observers said that the US Spot Bicoin ETF market’s record-high two consecutive day outflow was fueled by the all-time high outflows experienced by BlackRock and Fidelity. Data showed that the ETF market lost $671.9 million on December 19 and another $277 million in outflows the next day, December 20. The massive outflows experienced by the two of the biggest ETF issuers in the US sparked concerns from crypto investors on what could be the outlook for the ETFs in the upcoming months. However, analysts believed that the ordeal faced by BlackRock and Fidelity should not surprise traders since both international asset management firms have largely accounted for the large inflows. Some investors are concerned that recent development in ETFs might become a turning point that could lead to substantive decrease in the institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin exposure. Market observers argued that outflows might not linger, adding that after Bitcoin plummeted to $92,710 earlier, the alpha crypto has been bouncing back and moving up again. Trading analysts said that Bitcoin’s market volume dipped to $59.50 billion, a 52% decline in its total volume, contradicting the bullish run enjoyed by the crypto after Donald Trump won the US election last month. During the crypto bull run, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $108,000 per coin in November. In the same month, the US spot Bitcoin ETF also benefited from the crypto bull market after hitting a record-high of $6.2 billion in net inflows. As of press time, Bitcoin is traded at $95,359 per coin, down by 1.3% in the last 24 hours, with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio

Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields!

Title: Why Is Plug Power (PLUG) the Best Small Cap EV Stock to Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Small Cap EV Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) stands against the other small-cap EV stocks. The global electric vehicle (EV) market continues to expand, driven by the need for sustainable transportation and advancements in technology. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly 14 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2023, marking a 35% increase from the previous year, with 95% of these sales occurring in China, Europe, and the United States. This surge brought the total number of electric vehicles on the road to 40 million. Electric cars represented about 18% of all car sales in 2023, up from 14% in 2022 and just 2% in 2018. The growth is primarily driven by battery electric vehicles, which made up 70% of the electric car stock in 2023. The electric vehicle market is expected to expand rapidly as consumer demand for cleaner transportation grows. Electric car sales are expected to rise to about 17 million in 2024, which would be an increase of over 20% compared to 2023. Electric vehicles could make up more than 20% of all car sales in 2024. This forecast is supported by current trends, government policies, and the usual seasonal patterns seen in EV sales. China remains the largest market for electric vehicles, accounting for nearly 60% of new electric car registrations in 2023. Europe follows with approximately 25%, and the United States accounts for around 10%. READ ALSO: 12 Best RV and Camping Stocks To Buy Now and 8 Undervalued Insurance Stocks To Invest In. There is significant potential for growth in emerging markets, where EV adoption is taking off. We could soon see a shift from early adopters to mass-market consumers. The introduction of new models and innovations, such as improved battery technologies and charging solutions, will play a crucial role in this transition. Additionally, government policies and incentives continue to support the transition to electric mobility, further fueling demand. To compete with China in the EV market, the US is focusing on localizing its EV supply chain and increasing production capacity. Reuters reported on October 22 that US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced that the Department of Energy is quickly working to finalize $1.7 billion in grants aimed at converting automotive plants for electric vehicle production. This funding will help automakers change their existing facilities to make electric vehicles and their components. With continued advancements, investments, and increasing acceptance among consumers, the future looks promising for the electric vehicles market. To compile our list of the 11 best small-cap EV stocks to invest in, we reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best small-cap EV stocks. Please note that we defined small-cap stocks as those with a market capitalization between $500 million and $10 billion. From an initial pool of more than 20 small-cap EV stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 11 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At the end of 2022, Spotify (SPOT) stock was trading below $80 a share after a disastrous year for investors that erased over $35 billion from the company's market cap. Today, shares are trading at just under $500. The audio giant is on track to hit full-year profitability for the first time ever. And its market cap? About $100 billion, up from just $15 billion two years ago. The company's colossal run-up in stock price follows an intense business overhaul that's included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts, an area it had aggressively pursued. At the company's 2022 Investor Day, Spotify set seemingly lofty objectives that included long-term gross margin targets between 30% and 35%. At the time, the company had been struggling to turn a profit, with its gross margin stuck at around 25%. In the most recent quarter, Spotify said its gross margin increased to 31.1% from the prior year's 26.4%. "We've never been in a stronger position, thanks to what's really been an outstanding execution by the Spotify team," CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fiscal third quarter earnings call in November. He added, "We are where we set out to be, if not a little bit further, and on a steady path toward achieving our long-term goals." Wall Street analysts who cover Spotify have a median price target of just around $486 a share with 29 Buy ratings, eight Holds, and just three Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. Spotify, one of the stock market's big pandemic-era trades, saw shares balloon in early 2021 as the company sought to broaden its business from music streaming to other areas of the audio market. At the time, the company's endeavors echoed moves from other tech giants in pursuit of that goal. Think heavy spending on hiring and deep-pocketed investments in growth initiatives. For Spotify, that was podcasts. Between 2019 and 2021, Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market, signing on celebrities like the Obamas, Prince Harry, and Kim Kardashian. The company paid $230 million to acquire podcast studio Gimlet in 2019. Spotify then paid a reported $200 million to bring Joe Rogan exclusively to the platform, and another $200 million for the Ringer in 2020. But the spending era was short-lived as investors and analysts began to focus on the company's lack of profitability and cash flow issues, questioning the staying power of the business model and the credibility of CEO Daniel Ek. It's hard to make money in the audio streaming business, largely due to the sky-high price of content. And compared to its main competitors — deep-pocketed tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) — Spotify has had an even tougher time absorbing those costs. At the same time, companies in the space have to invest to expand their offerings to win market share. At Spotify, not only was spending aggressive, but a soft advertising market further crimped profit margins. Management attempted to assuage fears with promises that 2022 was a peak investment year and that profitability metrics would begin to improve in 2023. Skepticism still rang high. "Heading into 2023, investors looked at their targets and thought they were very overly ambitious," Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne told Yahoo Finance in an interview. "It really wasn't until they started to see the company make some proactive moves to drive both top-line growth, but also improve the profits of the company, that investors started to come back to the stock." Turnaround efforts first began in early 2023 as the company reorganized and consolidated business units. It adjusted its podcast strategy to focus more on reaching bigger audiences as opposed to maintaining exclusive content. It also changed up its royalty structure to combat streaming fraud and curb the massive volume of music on the platform, which has escalated as a result of generative AI. But the changes picked up steam over the course of last year, culminating in the fourth quarter when "two really important things happened as it relates to the stock performance," Swinburne said. No. 1, in Swinburne's view, was price increases. Spotify implemented a broad set of price hikes across roughly 70% of its footprint by revenue in mid-2023. The hikes were "much larger and broader than they'd ever done before as a company," the analyst said. Second: massive cost-cutting. The company laid off 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees, in December 2023. This followed a combined 800 employees who were laid off earlier in the year as a result of several restructurings. At the time, the significant reduction in headcount was estimated to lead to approximately 300 million euros ($315 million) in annualized cost savings for fiscal year 2024. "I don't know if I've ever seen a company take that aggressive of cost action while their revenue growth was accelerating, but it was happening at the same time the price increases were being put into place," Swinburne said. "So you had this dual effect of faster revenue growth combined with reduced expenses, which really set the company up into 2024 with a rapidly improving profit profile." Soon after the December layoffs, Spotify also announced that its CFO Paul Vogel would step down from his position after eight years. Vogel, who joined Spotify in 2016 as head of investor relations before taking over the CFO role in 2020, exited his position on March 31. Christian Luiga has since stepped into the role. The efforts didn't stop there. This year, Spotify has doubled down on another growth area with massive potential: audiobooks. "The audiobooks launch is much bigger than audiobooks," Swinburne explained. "It's really about transitioning Spotify from a music-only service to a bundle." The company introduced a higher-priced audio "bundle" that includes music, podcasts, and audiobooks. It also rolled out an audiobooks-only plan and a music-only streaming tier in an effort to cater to a variety of consumers. The changes allowed the company to increase prices for the second time in less than a year. "Spotify was able to show the value of the product to consumers because it had no noticeable churn increase from all of the pricing changes," Swinburne said. "And then, because they transitioned to a bundle, the margins of the business got meaningfully better." To that point, the long-term gross margin goal of 30% to 35% Ek set out for has already been achieved, with the metric once again expected to climb in the fourth quarter to 31.8%. "I think this demonstrates what we've been saying over the past year," Ek said last month. "Spotify is not just a great product but well on its way to become a great business." The proof is in the numbers: Spotify has continued to attract (and not lose) users despite higher prices. Its engagement remains the strongest among competitors, and the value-add of new bundles and premium offerings only strengthens its position. But perhaps most importantly, it's finally making money. And that's always music to investors' ears. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @allie_canal, LinkedIn, and email her at alexandra.canal@yahoofinance.com.

Ethereum whales buy the dip as most metrics signal end of correction. Ethereum’s ([ETH] whale activity contrasted with its price, showing significant buying during the downturn. Over three days, whales acquired 340,000 ETH, valued over $1 billion, suggesting strategic bulk purchases during price dips. This pattern against a backdrop of general crypto declines, sparked speculation about potential market rebound. Source: Ali/X The activity aligned with historical patterns where substantial buys often precede market recoveries. This hinted that ETH might soon experience a price increase if this trend holds true. Ethereum weekly chart indicated a potential completion of its correction. The price successively retested the Tenkan and Kijun lines of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, suggesting a stabilization. Further signs of support were evident as ETH interacted with the Kumo Cloud’s Senkou Span A, seen as a preliminary resistance turned support. Source: Titan of Crypto/X Additionally, the lagging span retraced to its Tenkan line, reinforcing the resilience of current price levels. Despite these bullish signals, there remained caution with a possible retest of the Kumo Cloud’s Senkou Span B. If Ethereum’s price approaches this line, it would likely signify a critical test of market sentiment and strength. Again, the Long Term Trend Directions (LTTD) score the year could end at a strong bullish level of 0.82, suggesting a positive long-term outlook. Despite a brief dip in mid-year, the LTTD returned to bullish territory. Ethereum started a consistent climb, coinciding with the LTTD score maintaining above 0.5, indicating sustained buyer interest. Source: X The sharp decline in the LTTD score in July corresponded with a price drop, showing a short-term bearish phase. However, the quick recovery in LTTD by October and a corresponding price rise suggested the correction phase ended, and ETH was resuming its long-term upward trend. However, Ethereum ETFs experienced notable outflows, with BlackRock’s ETHA seeing the largest ever, around $103.7 million, during a week marked by market declines. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs also witnessed their most significant outflow since inception, totaling around $671.9 million. This reversal ended two consecutive weeks of inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Source: SpotOnChain Notably, despite the outflows, BlackRock accumulated substantial positions, adding 13.7K BTC valued at $1.45 billion and 33.9K ETH worth $143.7 million. These movements indicated significant shifts in ETF dynamics, reflecting broader market sentiments and potentially setting the stage for future trends in cryptocurrency investments.

Title: Social Impact Leadership: How To Walk The Talk In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pklein/2024/12/22/social-impact-leadership-how-to-walk-the-talk-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T13:35:06Z

LinkedIn Head of Social Impact Meg Garlinghouse (L) with LinkedIn Business Leadership Program ... [+] Associate Eva Scarano (R) on January 22, 2018 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images for LinkedIn) Employees, consumers, and investors will soon start demanding proof of social impact. Performative efforts from businesses will no longer be tolerated and walking the talk will become non-negotiable. The social and environmental implications of this year’s political reversal of power have already started to take effect. “In January 2023 three out of four leaders would have said their companies were supportive of DEI,” said Daryl Brewster of CEO Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP) “A year later, it was one out of four, and three out of four were saying, my number one job is explaining what this is all about, and how it relates to the business.” The election campaign of former President Donald Trump was a de facto referendum against DEI and ESG. During the campaign, corporations including Walmart, Boeing, Ford, and Lowe’s, announced plans to scrap or step back from DEI-related initiatives. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, significantly reduced its support for shareholder proposals addressing environmental and social issues. Project 2025 calls for an end to American climate leadership on the international stage. Businesses have faced relentless scrutiny over their inability to translate social and environmental commitments into tangible outcomes. Research during 2024 revealed the gap between corporate intentions and social impact. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, 63% of respondents believe businesses are failing to deliver on their social impact promises. Over seven in ten employees surveyed believe that there is a gap between what their company says about social responsibility and how their company behaves, according to Accelerating a Just Transition, a new report from Globescan and Ashoka. Despite what many people predict will be a pullback on progressive social change, some corporate and civil society leaders believe this is the beginning of a new era for business and social impact. One that is characterized by companies taking meaningful action to improve the lives of employees and citizens. “What's coming is an opportunity for us to innovate in the CSR, ESG and DEI space because this is the first time we've really been pressure tested, challenged in our thinking about something that affects so many people,” said Muneer Panjwani, CEO of Engage for Good. To get an informed perspective on what the future will look like for business and social impact, I turned to Brewster, Panjwani, Ryan Gellert, CEO of Patagonia, and Dave Stever, CEO of Ben & Jerry’s. The collective perspective of these leaders contributed to 10 priorities that can help more companies walk the talk and become social impact leaders. “When a company becomes legally accountable to its stakeholders—workers, communities, customers, suppliers and the environment—’walking the talk’ becomes a default. Our work on the B Corp Impact Assessment helped us identify our strengths and blind spots and ensured thoroughness when looking at how we operate as a business,” said Gellert. Walking the talk also means bringing social impact into every aspect of businesses including employee engagement, supply chains, how products are developed and the materials that are being used. Panjwani believes companies need to be smarter about integrating social impact into their business and gave the example of Macy's Mission Every One approach as an example of a company that involves every leader and employee in social impact. In today’s highly polarized context, employees and consumers have taken opposing sides with respect to how specific populations have been prioritized over others. “We’re entering a moment where people are being questioned on their social impact work,” said Panjwani. He recommends continuing the work but reframing it with accuracy and honesty that includes all people. “One of the ways people feel excluded is when they feel like their identity and lived experience doesn't matter,” said Panjwani. “We need to address areas that are priorities for all political sides such as taking care of your workers, having a safe place to work, and being paid a fair wage,” said Brewster. There are 14 million employees across CECP’s member companies. According to Brewser, listening is one of the hardest things for them to do and also an opportunity to walk the talk. “You have that workforce at your fingertips, listen to them, you have employee resource groups, you have these tools at your disposal, listen to your customers, just get a better sense of what the need is,” said Brewster. He believes that now is the time for leaders to engage and support their employees because they “may not find people on the other side of this, or if they do, they're going to be even more expensive.” Businesses need guidance on how to talk about what they’re doing in real world human terms that can unite people. “What words can be used across your business and with your customers, so they understand what you're doing, and how you're authentically showing up,” said Brewster. “Talk about clean air, talk about reducing your insurance costs, talk about real things that people can understand and have the same thing happen around diversity.” Panjwani observes that there's a communications problem and companies are unsure of the story they should be telling. “DEI work has been framed in a very specific way and I think it's time that we evolved that. To create a broader framing that allows practices to stay as they are, without being called DEI, but focused on their core purpose which is equity-deserving communities.” Partnering with nonprofit organizations can help advance social impact.“A simple way of ensuring your donations are going to vetted organizations is joining a group like 1% for the Planet. Individuals can also visit Patagonia Action Works, our tool to connect people with environmental organizations acting on the most pressing issues facing the world today,” said Gellert. “Whenever corporations work with a non-profit partner their brand reputation benefits because they get access to the organization's knowledge, network and the communities that they serve,” said Panjwani. Gellert believes there are three paths to consider. “First, businesses can work to add solar and wind energy into your power mix. Secondly, you can also take a deeper look into your company’s finances using tools like the Carbon Bankroll to ensure your financial institutions aren’t funding extractive industries and cash flowing the climate crisis. Lastly, put your support behind local, state and federal public policy that advances renewable energy.” Gellert also believes that we are facing an era of deregulation that’s likely to sacrifice the planet’s long-term welfare for short-term profit. “We have the choice as business leaders to act on the planet’s behalf and keep to our environmental commitments whether the government mandates it or not,” said Gellert. “As businesses, we have a voice both in our action and through lobbying to show solidarity in our support for the planet.” It’s also important to move away from anecdotal stories and use data to prove that the business has improved. “For example, if your company is focused on fair hiring practices and equity for employees the benefits are easily quantified,” said Panjwani. “Diverse representation in companies leads to more innovation, more creativity, and improved retention.” Companies can use frameworks from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) that offer standardized metrics for evaluating performance. AI is also creating new opportunities for companies to track progress in real-time and share insights with stakeholders. Disclosure is important, and has become a requirement in many industries and jurisdictions, but it doesn't necessarily result in social impact. “In fact, it may get in the way If it takes staff away from actually implementing the programs,” said Brewster. “Some companies will just pay the fine if it’s less expensive than doing the work. Or move people who are actually doing the work to just reporting on what they’re doing.” Walking the talk means prioritizing doing over disclosing. I believe one of the most authentic ways to walk the talk is by involving stakeholders, including people with lived experience, in determining what issues to focus on and how to take action. Co-creating innovative solutions with customers, employees, and community partners ensures that initiatives are relevant and impactful. For example, IKEA’s "Better Living" initiatives involve collaborating with local communities to promote sustainable living practices while driving product innovation. Dave Stever, CEO of Ben & Jerry’s shared his plans for how the company will be walking the talk in 2025. They embody the priorities outlined above. “To remain vigilant to our values at Ben & Jerry's, we must embed them into every fiber of our operations and supply chain—standing unapologetically for equity, climate justice, and human rights. In the current political climate, there is increased pressure for businesses to temper their voices, but it is precisely in these moments that our voices matter most. Staying true to our principles means fostering transparency, amplifying marginalized voices, and aligning our business practices and 3-part mission with the change we want to see. At the heart of this commitment is courage—courage to take risks, to challenge systemic inequities, and to innovate not just for growth but for good.” I’ve spent 25 years urging major corporations to have meaningful social impact and the results of this work are not nearly good enough. Despite a clear business case for social impact, very few corporations have gone beyond trying to get noticed for doing the bare minimum. This won’t fly anymore. CSR, DEI, and ESG became obsolete in 2024 and there is a new imperative for businesses: to prioritize social impact over greenwashing and social washing and to demonstrate authentic action by walking the talk. “As business leaders, we need to recognize that the climate crisis shouldn’t be minimized into a marketing opportunity,” said Gellert. “So how do we ‘walk the talk’ in business when it comes to societal issues and environmental responsibility? Commit and take a step forward.” “As we navigate 2025, a year charged with political and social currents, companies must commit to being more than profit-driven entities; we must be stewards of progress,” said Stever.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings On big down days for the stock market or prolonged stretches of sell-offs, it's good to have a trusted playbook. Think of it as a guide to keeping your sanity amidst the chaos and, hopefully, your portfolio flush with long-term gains. For me, the sell-off playbook is a twofold exercise honed over years of reporting on business news. First, chat up the smartest people I know in markets and business. What are they doing and saying, and why? Do they sound or look fearful? And two, think deeply on whether something truly has changed in the market or if investors are in a tizzy over splashy headlines. Suffice it to say, I had to dust off this sell-off playbook this week. The end assessment: Relax, folks, this isn't the start of a bear market even though the tape feels punishing. Why, you ask? A lot of the smartest people in the room, so to speak, have valid reasons to stay long on stocks AND the economy isn't falling off a cliff AND we are likely to still get rate cuts in 2025 AND we have a pro-business president in Trump taking office in less than a month. "Big picture, with record earnings, record profit margins, strong productivity, and overall improving consumer and small business sentiment, it is hard to think that this bull market is over," Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told me. Says Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner, "The bull market is still intact, but we are seeing a short-term gut check." A gut check, indeed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average promptly finished Wednesday's session down more than 1,100 points. It rallied slightly on Thursday, but the selling pressure renewed on Friday. The index of 30 well-known stocks such as Salesforce (CRM) and Disney (DIS) is off by almost 4% in December as losing stretches have begun to pile on one another amid renewed uncertainty on rate cuts. The S&P 500 is down 3% this month. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6% in December. What has spooked the markets is the Fed not committing to aggressive rate cutting in 2025. The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possibly inflationary tariffs on China. "I don't see many [economic] red flags. People are cautiously optimistic if they own businesses, whether they're small, medium, or large," San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. But again, nothing I heard from Daly suggested she is concerned about the demand outlook in the US despite inflation being stickier than she and other voting Fed members would like. "The Fed was hawkish but I think people are jumping the gun on assuming rate cuts are over — that’s not what Powell said (plus he just gave markets 100 bps of easing in 2024)," Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told me. "I do think 2025 could start a bit bumpy as Washington may be a bit dysfunctional (as we’re seeing now) and the Fed isn’t as dovish anymore, but I don’t think either are fatal to the bull market unless we see growth start to roll over." Then on the topic of demand, all signs point to an economy continuing to do quite well and supportive of strong earnings growth in 2025. Nike (NKE) called out double-digit percentage e-commerce growth this week for Black Friday on its earnings call. The latest retail sales report was strong. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff tells me he is securing new AI deals at a rapid clip, just weeks after announcing earnings. The AI thesis remains intact and will likely be a key driver of profits and valuation multiples in 2025. "There are strong indicators that this could be a tough year — and, potentially, decade — for the stock market. I’m going to be bold and say we will see the opposite. I have no doubt that AI will drive the stock market in both the short and long term. Countries that lead in AI will see the fastest GDP growth, as well as a significant improvement in standard of living and defense capabilities. And, whoever leads with AI as a company will lead in their industry, regardless of their sector," former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers flagged this week as one of his 2025 predictions. So, while things feel as if they have changed in the market this week, drill down and it looks similar to what has powered the gains in 2024. Nothing lasts forever, and stocks don't go up in a straight line — two phrases to live by in life and in investing.

Title: How Bitcoin Became Boring

As a result, bitcoin loses its outsider vibe to gain institutional blessing. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Until now, the phrase crypto winter meant that cryptocurrency traders were facing hard times: a period of tumbling and depressed prices that had to be weathered until the good times returned. Today, though, the cryptocurrency industry is enjoying an end-of-year season more akin to “brat summer”: This month, crypto prices hit previously unheard-of highs, with bitcoin trading above $100,000. In this new Era of Good Feelings—to borrow a phrase from early-19th-century American history—skeptics have become believers, and a digital-economic instrument that was designed to circumvent, if not replace, the traditional financial system is becoming more and more integrated into it. The catalyst for this boom, of course, was last month’s election of Donald Trump. Bitcoin’s price fell this week, but it’s still up almost 40 percent since November 5, and other major cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and ripple, have seen similar spikes. It’s not hard to see why. Trump nominated Cantor Fitzgerald CEO and crypto enthusiast Howard Lutnick to be his secretary of commerce. He named Paul Atkins, also a crypto advocate, as the next head of the Securities Exchange Commission, replacing Gary Gensler, who became crypto’s bête noire for bringing lawsuits against the biggest crypto exchanges and numerous other players in the industry. And Trump recently repeated his campaign promise to set up a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which would require the Treasury Department to purchase billions of dollars’ worth of the cryptocurrency and hold it as a “permanent national asset.” On top of the regulatory environment growing markedly more crypto-friendly, other bullish signs have emerged as well. Last week, the investment giant BlackRock, which back in January was one of 10 companies to issue exchange-traded funds tied to bitcoin, released a report suggesting that investors “with suitable governance and risk tolerance” (meaning tolerance for little governance and lots of risk) should consider having as much as 2 percent of their assets in bitcoin. And MicroStrategy, a software company whose business nowadays consists almost entirely of issuing stock and convertible debt in order to buy bitcoin, was just added to the Nasdaq-100 after its stock rose more than 600 percent in the first 10 months of the year. All of the good news has bitcoin owners—also known as HODLers, a moniker derived from a common online typo of hold that was then also said to stand for “hold on for dear life”—feeling buoyant: On X, predictions of bitcoin hitting $1 million by the end of 2025 are easy to find. I first wrote about bitcoin in 2011, when one Bitcoin cost about $14, and even then, I thought it was a bubble. Had I just taken a flyer and bought $1,000 of it, I’d be a multimillionaire today. So for longtime bitcoin skeptics like me, a measure of chagrin at having been so wrong about crypto’s evolution is difficult to avoid. At the same time, what’s been fascinating about the popular embrace of bitcoin is that the reasons to be skeptical of it never disappeared: It’s still an enormously volatile asset; its price is still mostly dependent on sentiment rather than underlying fundamental value; it’s still ill-suited to be a widely used digital currency. What’s changed is that the investment world has decided none of those things really matter. As is true of gold, bitcoin is valuable because people have collectively decided it’s valuable. In effect, HODLers have succeeded in conjuring a respectable asset out of thin air. James Surowiecki: The Trump-whim economy is here Respectability doesn’t mean stability. The history of crypto over the past decade is one of big spikes driven by positive sentiment, rapidly followed by crashes. Bitcoin’s value has fallen by 49 percent or more on at least half a dozen occasions, and there’s no reason to believe that it’s now reached a permanently high plateau. (Indeed, just this past week, after hitting an all-time high of about $108,000, bitcoin’s price fell almost 15 percent in days, and MicroStrategy saw its stock fall more than 40 percent over the past month.) Yet even if determining a fair price for Bitcoin remains a near-impossible task (which is why I’ll never buy it), treating its value as simply the product of a hysterical bubble mentality—which was once a common critique—feels outdated. In keeping with its buccaneering, unregulated origins, the crypto industry is still rife with sketchy so-called memecoins and shitcoins, not to mention promoters promising 1,000 percent returns in a matter of days. But bitcoin itself has become practically blue-chip. The reasons bitcoin has become so highly valued are not the reasons that advocates originally argued would make it valuable. Bitcoin was designed to be a currency that people could use for trustless transactions—transactions that could be carried out without need for a financial intermediary such as a bank. But transactions in which bitcoin is used to buy or sell goods and services make up only a tiny fraction of the currency’s total trading volume, most of which is made up of people buying or selling bitcoin itself. Bitcoin’s real use, it turns out, is not as a medium of exchange, but as a secure, portable, accessible store of value, something that can be quite valuable, particularly in countries where inflation or confiscatory government policy is a problem. Similarly, bitcoin was designed to facilitate decentralized person-to-person transactions, but most bitcoin trading, at least in the West, now takes place on centralized exchanges. Again, in its liberatory promise, bitcoin was supposed to not just be independent of traditional financial institutions and government, but also enable alternatives to them. Yet the big engine of the price boom of the past two years has been bitcoin’s integration into the conventional investment industry (through such vehicles as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs), increased purchases by institutional investors and corporations, and now the prospect of legitimization by the government itself. That may include government buying of bitcoin—though exactly why Uncle Sam would want to own such a volatile asset is a question no one has yet answered persuasively. This integration has a couple of striking consequences. The first is that, for all of its benefits, it also adds a whole new set of risks to an already risky asset—if, say, Trump does not follow through on his promise to set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, bitcoin’s price will likely take a tumble. The other, more substantive, consequence is that the revolutionary promise of bitcoin has largely vanished—no one really thinks it will replace, or even meaningfully weaken, fiat currencies such as the dollar, nor is it going to threaten the financial primacy of Wall Street. Cryptocurrencies will always have a special appeal for people who are skeptical of the system and convinced that economic disaster is on the horizon. But what the past six weeks have shown is that most bitcoin HODLers don’t want to bring down the system. They want bitcoin to become a part of it.

Title: Elon Musk could soon be as rich as the Netherlands

In 2027 or soon after we’ll have a new type of fat cat on the planet: the trillionaire (in dollar terms at least). We’ve had billionaires for over a century. US oil tycoon John D Rockefeller was the first to reach that milestone in 1916. According to wealth tracking group Informa Connect Academy (ICA), several current industry titans will achieve trillionaire status before the end of this decade. Elon Musk leads the race but it depends on whose share price performs best over the intervening period. As the head of the electric carmaker Tesla, private rocket company SpaceX and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk is currently the world’s richest man with a current net worth on paper of roughly $450 billion (€431.5bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. His wealth is estimated to have jumped by more than $170 billion since the US election and his alliance with president-elect Donald Trump, largely on the back of Tesla’s share price. Since the November 5th election Tesla’s stock has surged 70 per cent. On the basis of his current trajectory the ICA predicts he will hit the trillion mark in 2027. But Telsa’s share price has been volatile and Musk appears to be driving X into the ground so things may change. India’s business mogul Gautam Adani is predicted to hit the trillion mark in 2028 followed by Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the AI giant Nvidia, and Prajogo Pangestu, the Indonesian energy and mining mogul, provided their current financial trajectories hold. $1 trillion is a hard quantum to hold in your head. Put it this way it would comfortably buy every home in Ireland. It was only six years ago that companies reached the trillion dollar milestone in terms of valuations (Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion mark in August 2018) and we marvelled, or thought absurd, that a single company could be financially bigger than a developed economy. There are currently nine companies with trillion dollar valuations: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Saudi Aramco, Meta, Berkshire Hathway and Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC. Now we’re about to confront the notion that an individual could be as valuable as a developed nation and the millions of workers and their labour that comprise it. The Netherlands, one of Europe’s richest countries, has an annual GDP (gross domestic product) of roughly $1 trillion (€960bn). So if the ICA is right Musk will be richer than the Netherlands is now by 2027. What this acceleration in individual wealth says about the state of the world or modern capitalism is disturbing. On one level it suggests that the current period of rapid technological transformation has outgunned the antitrust legislation designed to police it, creating behemoth monopolies and uber elites wielding too much economic power. According to UK economist Duncan Weldon, the wealth of these aspiring trillionaires is also tied into three more conventional but no less consequential economic trends: decades of low interest rates (which have boosted asset values); accelerated corporate profits; and a shift towards less progressive tax systems. Combined these trends have accelerated global inequality. And this appears to be feeding into a breakdown in consensus politics, a throwback to the Rockefeller days when democracy in many countries fractured. According to Oxfam, this inequality trend has been supercharged by the pandemic. In a report earlier this year the charity noted that almost five billion people had been made poorer by the pandemic while the wealth of the five richest people had more than doubled, from $405 billion in 2020 to $869 billion in late 2023. That’s an increase of $14 million an hour. Oxfam says the world’s richest 1 per cent now own 43 per cent of all global financial assets and emit as much carbon pollution as the poorest two-thirds of humanity. Let’s not be naive, market capitalism depends on inequality and is, in part, driven by it (some people will work harder or take financial risks to get ahead), but when the gap between top and bottom gets too large, when a critical mass of citizens feel the system is rigged against them, we tend to get radical politics. That was surely the lesson of the 20th century. In the 1960s the gap was modest by today’s standards. Expressed as the ratio of the boss’s salary to those on the factory floor, it was just 15-to-1 in the US. According to the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute it is now 221-to-1. Other estimates suggest it is higher. Of course salary is just one metric. In Ireland and other countries an intergenerational divide on housing has become a major and ongoing source of grievance. Musk said once that he believed the effects of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) on employment would soon make it necessary for countries to provide citizens with a basic income as a guardrail against inequality. This was before he bought his way into the second Trump presidency (spending a reported $250 million on the campaign) and supercharged his wealth in the process.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. You've likely heard the term "supercommuter," but you might have wondered… why? Someone who does it from Washington, DC, to NYC admits she's not sure the job is worth the commute. Still, she's not regretting doing it. On the agenda today: But first: Blackstone's feeling festive. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. Blackstone released its annual holiday video for the seventh consecutive year, which might elicit the reaction: Why is a firm managing $1 trillion worried about holiday videos? The videos — full of self-deprecating jokes and Blackstone-backed product placement (of course) — have become a bit of an annual tradition on Wall Street. Last year's notched 8 million views across platforms, a spokesman told BI. We've got a full rundown and ranking of all seven videos here. Some people are laughing at Blackstone as opposed to with Blackstone, but that's kind of the point. In an industry full of super serious people doing super serious business for super serious clients, Blackstone's willing to make itself the butt of the joke. Ok, yes, there is a business case for the videos. Jay Gillespie, the head of Blackstone's video team and one of the brains behind the holiday extravaganza, spoke to BI's Alex Nicoll about the evolution of his role at the firm. Blackstone's not alone in its outside-the-box approach to marketing on the Street. More firms are getting a bit — to borrow a phrase from my British colleagues — cheeky in pitching themselves to the general public. Take BlackRock, which a few years ago took to social media to make clear it's not Blackstone. (The firms have a long history together and have sometimes lean into the confusion between the two. BlackRock CEO and cofounder Larry Fink made a cameo in Blackstone's holiday video this year: "Can you believe people confuse US for THEM?") Wall Street's marketing frenzy isn't foolproof. For an industry that prides itself on what kind of business you are bringing to a firm, marketing's impact isn't as direct as landing a massive deal or hitting the perfect trade. Wealthy musicians received millions of dollars from the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, a pandemic relief program intended for struggling independent venues and arts groups. However, stars like Lil Wayne and Chris Brown used the program as a piggy bank to keep the party going, exclusive reporting from BI shows. Thousands of pages of accounting documents reveal how artists directed millions in taxpayer funds toward their own bank accounts, luxury purchases, and entertainment expenses — often outweighing what they spent on touring crew members. How musicians spent the grant money. Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, a Spanish duchess, devoted much of her life to cataloging the Archive of Medina-Sidonia, a priceless collection that had been in her family for generations. Comprising of 6 million documents, the archive details the secrets of the kings, dukes, and explorers of medieval Spain. After Luisa Isabel died, she left her three children just 743,000 euros. However, the bulk of her estate — and control of the archives — went to the woman she'd married on her deathbed. What ensued after was a bitter legal battle that would shatter the family, captivate Spain, and throw the fate of the archives into doubt. Inside the palace showdown. There is perhaps no real-estate metric more loved — and loathed — than Zillow's automated home valuation tool. The Zestimate draws casual clickers to the site, whether it's to lurk on previous residences, friends' or colleagues' homes, or the value of your neighbor's property against yours. The problem is that the Zestimate is often misguided, and Americans' obsession with it can create crushing reality checks when homes actually hit the market. But that's not a problem for Zillow. Earlier this month, Citigroup welcomed 34 managing directors, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, however, the bank's promotion process can be political and pit employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told BI. The bank rates its employees on a forced curve, assessing them from best to worst. These rankings influence whether an employee might receive a promotion or lose their bonus. Managing directors break down how it works. This week's quote: "What we're having to speak of already sounds like we're lying — it already sounds like a movie because it's so horrible." — Adria English worked as a dancer at Sean "Diddy" Combs' famous white parties and filed a lawsuit in July accusing him of sex trafficking. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations of sexual assault and sex trafficking.

Title: Dick’s Sporting Goods’ Chairman Decided To ‘Kill’ His Own Stores. It’s Made Him Billions.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2024/12/22/dicks-sporting-goods-ed-stack-chairman-decided-to-kill-his-own-stores-its-made-him-billions/

Ed Stack stands with his arms crossed, surveying the wall of colorful basketball shoes near the entrance of Dick’s Sporting Goods’ House of Sport in Pittsburgh’s Ross Park Mall. The vast selection of around 2,400 pairs of Nike Air Jordans, Under Armour Currys and more — known as the “Footwear Deck” — is a key part of Dick’s’ strategy to stand out in the digital age. A separate soccer-skewed section, House of Cleats, downstairs has at least 300 other pairs. “People really want to feel it, touch it, try it on,” and experience it, explains Stack, 69, Dick’s’ executive chairman. That’s why there’s also a 31.5-foot indoor climbing wall visible directly over Stack’s shoulder, nearby batting cages, golf bays, and even a 18,000 square foot outdoor sports field for customers to use. Plus there are technicians on hand to restring racquets, lace baseball gloves and sharpen ice skates. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes These bells and whistles are features of a new jumbo store format that Dick’s is opening across the country. The House of Sport is double to triple the size of a regular 50,000 square foot location. The Pittsburgh mega-store, the closest one to Dick’s’ corporate headquarters–where Forbes interviewed Stack in November–opened in April in a long abandoned Sears; it’s the third largest Dick’s location to date at 140,000 square feet. The biggest, at nearly 150,000 square feet, is in Salem, New Hampshire, plus there are 15 more of these behemoth complexes already open with plans to retrofit up to 100 of its 725 U.S. locations by 2027. (Dick’s has another 136 “specialty stores,” including Golf Galaxy and outdoor chain Public Lands.) Forbes estimates the retailer will spend nearly $2 billion on this expansion. Dick’s is doubling down on brick-and-mortar at a time when many retailers are downsizing or shuttering locations - more than 6,480 stores in the U.S. closed this year, the highest number since 2020, according to data from Coresight research. It’s just the latest gamble from Stack, who has spent four decades obsessing about ways to beat competitors; he bought the company from his father, the original founder, in 1984. “I was always an athlete, a mediocre athlete but I loved the competition,” he says, sipping a glass bottle of Coca-Cola. (The only sport he plays these days is golf.) “Ed is always pushing himself to be better, his company to be better, his team to be better and his partners to be better,” says Nike’s CEO Elliott Hill, describing him as “courageous and competitive.” He’s known Stack for 20 years; Nike is a key partner of Dick’s, accounting for about 24% of its $13 billion in 2023 sales. Stack instilled this mindset in his management team, too. “We’re constantly looking around corners. And we joke, we say it's not a joke, but we have what we call productive paranoia,” says Lauren Hobart, Dick’s CEO since 2021. “But that's actually the root of a lot of our success. We don't take a lot of time looking backward or resting on our laurels.” “Ed Stack is a genius who inherited a mom and pop sporting goods store and turned it into a national retail powerhouse,” says Phil Knight, founder of Nike, which sold about $3 billion of its branded product at Dick’s last year. It’s been a winning formula. Dick’s, which has already outlived a number of now-defunct rivals like Sports Authority, Herman’s and Modell’s, is one of just a handful of retailers to record consistent same-store sales growth since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Morgan Stanley equity analyst Simeon Gutman. (Others include Walmart, Costco and O’Reilly Auto Parts.) Revenue is expected to hit a record of up to $13.3 billion this year, up from $8.8 billion in 2019, a more than 50% jump. And the stock is up nearly 800% in that same time, including 60% in the past year. Stack, who has not sold a single share of his voting stock since taking the company public in 2002 and remains the biggest individual shareholder, is now worth $5.4 billion. Business didn’t look so good back in 2018. Sales were stagnating as it fought for relevance against online retailers like Amazon and Walmart and began phasing guns out of their stores. It also took a hit as some of its brands began selling directly to consumers or, in Under Armour’s case, distributing to lower-priced stores like Kohl’s. Stack quickly took action. “The brief I gave everybody was we need to sit down and we need to design the concept that will kill Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Stack, dressed in a plaid navy suit, explains from a conference room hidden behind a set of large, wooden doors in the back of the Pittsburgh store. “If someone opened the store that we’re going to design across the street from us, we’d be out of business, we wouldn't survive.” Covid was a boon for Dick’s as outdoor sports like golf, running and kayaking exploded in popularity; at one point in 2020, Dick’s sold out of kayaks in nearly 500 of its locations. But it wasn’t just luck. After closing all its stores in March that year, it took just two days for Dick’s to open for curbside pickup, a feat that was only possible due to an earlier overhaul of its ecommerce site that brought the technology in-house. This hybrid model of buying online and picking up in-person has proven deeply popular with customers. “It’s the convenience,” explains Hobart. “If you’re running to your kid’s game and realize you don’t have a cleat, you know the size is in stock and that you can quickly get to the field.” Shoppers also like knowing ahead of time that what they want is in stock. The company has five distribution centers but today more than 90% of sales are fulfilled by the stores, yet another factor fueling the House of Sport push: more square footage can house more inventory for better delivery times. “There’s no other retailer that I cover that’s had a turnaround like Dick’s has,” says Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Says Stack, about the recent changes: “We do virtually nothing the same.” This isn’t the first time Ed Stack has reinvented his family business. He was 13 when he started working for his father at the original Dick’s, then called Dick’s Bait and Tackle. The elder Stack had started the business as a teen in 1948 as a modest bait-and-tackle supplier in Binghamton, New York. Ed spent his summers, vacations and Christmases in the about 600-square-foot store, unloading merchandise from trucks and attaching price tags. The eldest of five children, Ed was expected to work at the store full-time after graduating high school. But there was one problem: “I hated every minute,” he recalls. Richard "Dick" Stack (left) and Ed Stack (right). The pair didn't always see eye to eye, which is what led dad to sell out to son. Ed and Dick had a strained relationship. Stack has attributed this to his father’s short temper. (Even so, there is a framed picture of Dick Stack in every Dick’s location.) In 1973, Ed, an admittedly subpar student, left home for St. John Fisher University in Rochester, New York, with the dream of becoming a lawyer. He dropped those plans when his father’s heart temporarily stopped following a double bypass surgery from which he never fully recovered. Ed returned home to join the business after graduation in 1977. His dad’s tackle shop was not the Stack family’s first entrepreneurial venture. His grandfather was a bootlegger during prohibition before dying in a car crash in 1935. This time was different: Ed fell in love with retail, though he continued to clash with his father, who lived for two more decades. The younger Stack wanted to expand, while his dad, who nearly went bankrupt after opening a second location in 1953, didn’t want to take any risks. Seven years in, things reached a breaking point. “My dad was a pretty colorful guy and he looked at me and said, ‘You think you’re such a smart S.O.B., go down to the bank, get your own line of credit and buy me out. So that’s what I did,” recalls Stack, who along with his four siblings bought their father’s two stores in Binghamton. They agreed in 1984 to pay the older Stack $1.25 million over 20 years at a 12% annual interest rate plus the price of leasing his two stores for 25 years–Dick’s terms. They paid the rest of the sum out to their stepmother following Dick’s death in 1998 after a battle with dementia caused by his cardio vascular problems. (Ed’s siblings have not been involved with the business in decades, and none own over 5%.) Finally in charge, Ed got to work expanding Dick’s’ inventory beyond hunting and fishing gear. He forged relationships with brands like Nike (around 1978) and Adidas (1980). When it came to Dick’s’ brick-and-mortar growth, Stack studied Walmart founder Sam Walton and mimicked his idea of opening stores in “concentric circles” around the company’s launch point (in Dick’s’ case: Binghamton). Stack drove around small or medium-sized cities counting the number of swing sets in people’s yards; he also looked at the popularity of youth sports leagues, the number of colleges nearby, and the weather–after discovering that his offerings sold better in colder climates. Soon there were stores in Syracuse, New York; Hartford, Connecticut and Erie, Pennsylvania. Around this time, he brought in the company’s first outside investors: venture capitalists Michael Barach of Bessemer Venture Partners, Jerry Gallagher of Oak Investment Partners and Janet Hickey of Scout Group, as well as Denis Defforey, a cofounder of French supermarket chain Carrefour and an early advisor of Dick’s, who together infused more than $16 million. In 2014, Stack sued Mitch Modell, the CEO of now-defunct rival Modell’s Sporting Goods who he accused of using a disguise to spy on Dick’s. They settled for $1 on the condition that Modell would never do it again. The rapid expansion soon backfired. “I joined in March [of 1995] and realized by August we were going to run out of cash,” recalls Mike Hines, Dick’s’ chief financial officer for 12 years until 2007. “I was pissed.” A key problem: the new stores were too big. “We did the calculations and the size of the store that was most effective was 50,000 square feet,” says Hines. The stores they were building were up to 70,000 square feet. Dick’s dug itself out of the hole by securing a $140 million loan from GE Capital, contingent on the existing investors putting up more capital. They did – to the tune of $35 million – resulting in Stack losing majority control of his family business. Dick’s halted new store openings for 18 months, and focused on monitoring inventory and margins. By 1997, the company had largely bounced back from the crisis. Three years later, Stack borrowed another $60 million from GE Capital, this time to buy out his investors. Over the next two years, Dick’s hit $1 billion sales and then Stack took the company public, vowing to maintain majority voting control over the company always. Another crucial moment for Dick’s came in after a 19-year-old former high school student shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Valentine’s Day 2018. Two weeks later, Stack announced he was banning the sale of all assault rifles and guns to anyone under the age of 21. “What happened in Parkland had a really profound impact on me,” says the billionaire, who later flew to Florida to meet with the families of victims. “I’m not much of a crier… I hadn’t cried that much since my mother passed away,” he says, “It got to a point where I said, ‘I don't want to be a part of this story any longer.’” "What we’ve always been concerned about is that we wake up one day and have a tired old chain." Dick’s destroyed the $5 million worth of semi-automatic rifles left in its inventory. The guns were sawed into pieces and turned into scrap metal, prompting outrage from the trade association National Shooting Sports Foundation and the National Rifle Association. “What a waste, and what a strange business model,” the NRA tweeted at the time. Dick’s predicted dropping these guns would cost the company at least a quarter of a billion in revenue, or 3.5% of its overall sales at the time. The business did take a hit but it turned out to be a “great move,” says Stack. Soon after the shooting, Dick’s experimented with removing entire gun displays in 10 of its stores and replacing them with growing categories like footwear and apparel, and products popular in that specific region: fishing gear in Florida and outerwear in Boston, for example. Because the profit margin on hunting equipment was 17% lower on average than the rest of the store, these locations had to recapture just 60% of lost sales to break even. “We captured a little more than 100%,” says Stack. Nowadays no guns are sold at any Dick’s stores. (In January 2024, the company sold the retail naming rights of its hunting subsidiary, Field & Stream, to country singers Morgan Wallen and Eric Church.) The retailer’s gross profit margins have increased to 35% in 2023 from 29% in 2017, in part because of its increased emphasis on higher margin categories like clothing and shoes, which now make up 59% of Dick’s’ business, versus 54% in 2017. Stack didn’t advertise it at the time, but there was another big change in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting. The self-described “political junkie” decided in 2019 to quietly test the waters as an independent presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 race; it was at this point that Stack began “the succession planning process,” stepping down as CEO the next year. The longtime GOP donor cited extremism in both political parties as a key reason. “It’s really difficult to govern the country from as far right as we are [and] as far left as we are,” he explains. Stack, who believes the nation’s issues of education inequality and income inequality are deeply intertwined, spent less than $50,000 on the political run and said he dropped the plan after around 18 months, following an “intervention” by his friends and family. Says Stack, who hasn’t donated to any presidential candidates in the last two elections. “I have no political aspirations any longer.” Building bigger boxes nearly killed Dick’s 30 years ago. But Stack is convinced times are different now. Plus he’s taking a different tack. Instead of opening a flurry of new, larger stores, House of Sport focuses on redeveloping Dick’s’ existing fleet of stores. (This is helped by the fact that around of the company’s existing leases are up for renegotiation in the next three years). He also learned to take his time. Stack and his team spent years experimenting with different concepts in the 25,000 square foot “Lab Store” in Dick’s’ Pittsburgh HQ. It took until 2021 for the company to settle on a design it felt was different enough from Dick’s’ existing model. Since then they’ve opened an average of around four new stores every year. It’s also upgrading dozens more of its traditional 50,000 square foot stores with House of Sport fixtures like the Footwear Deck and House of Cleats. Though early, the results are encouraging. Each House of Sport was generating five to six times the amount of traffic of a traditional Dick’s, according to a March analysis from the retail data tracking platform Placer.ai. The company predicts it will take less than three years to recoup the roughly $18.5 million net investment it takes to build and stock each House of Sport. Landlords and vendors are also on board. “They’re creating a theater for their customers and an environment in which more of these vendors want the proper placement,” says Morgan Stanley analyst Gutman. "They went from Dick's needing the vendors more ... and now the entire relationship is flipped." While most House of Sport features are free for customers to use, the rock wall costs $15 per climb. Parts of the new stores can be rented out for birthday parties. Moving forward, Dick’s could have a rocky road ahead with Donald Trump in the White House. The president-elect has said he will move to impose unprecedented tariffs on his first day in office. He’s floated various figures including a 25% tariff penalty on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. Experts have predicted this will take a heavy toll on retailers who rely on imported materials. Dick’s’ challenge stems from the fact that around 87% of its revenue comes from selling other brands, whose supply chains it does not control. Hobart says Dick’s has been talking with its brand partners and “running scenarios” about what tariffs could mean for the company and its customers. She says her “hope” is that shoppers won’t be too affected if tariffs are indeed implemented. A big reason is that many of Dick’s’ suppliers were already forced to move away from Chinese imports during the pandemic. “I do think one of the important things is that the entire industry has been working on diversifying supply. It’s a requirement,” says Hobart. “So that’s a good thing. We’ve got supply coming in from multiple countries at this point.” Still, Dick’s’ future plans involve growing the parts of the business that it more directly controls. This includes its in-house brands like DSG and Calia (made in South East Asia); the latter was a partnership with country singer Carrie Underwood launched in 2015 that is now Dick’s’ top selling women’s brand after Nike (Underwood is no longer involved). These private label brands, which also boast higher margins, accounted for around 13% of revenue, or $1.6 billion, last year. It also now has a place where it can unload unsold inventory. Going, Going, Gone! is its three-year-old off-price store concept where customers can shop for bargains at one of its 20 permanent stores and 30 temporary locations so far. Yet another way the company is looking to add revenue is by creating a “retail media network” in which it uses consumer data collected from its loyalty program (accounting for 70% of revenue) and its Gamechanger app to do paid advertising for its partners. For example, if one of their partners wanted to better advertise to people beginning to train for a marathon, Dick’s will target those specific shoppers with ads. For Stack, who has now spent nearly 60 years working on Dick’s, these ongoing changes are par for the course. “One thing that always amazed me about Ed was that he’s a sponge for information. He is never married to an idea or a philosophy,” says Bill Colombo, the vice chair of Dick’s’ board who met Stack when they were put in the same dorm at St. John Fisher. “What we’ve always been concerned about is that we wake up one day and have a tired old chain,” says Stack. “We’ve seen so many retailers that … never really evolved and innovated their business. And a number of those retailers are gone today. We want to make sure that doesn’t happen to us.”

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other cookies and crackers stocks. The global cookie and cracker market was valued at $100.2 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $122.45 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7% during the forecast period between 2024 and 2030. Region-wise, North America dominates the market with the United States and Canada as its top markets. With significant markets in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, Europe follows. Simultaneously, Asia Pacific is depicting rapid growth with significant market expansion in countries such as China and India. According to Mondelēz International's annual State of Snacking Report 2023, consumers continue to snack strong as 6 in 10 global consumers surveyed for the last 5 years have been consistently of the opinion that they tend to eat many small meals throughout their days instead of few large ones while young people look forward to the snacks in their day, more as compared to the meals. Younger consumers tend to snack once or more a day. Across all ages, the majority have ritualized snack time as they consume a snack at a special moment or time of the day. Consistent snack spending is evident from the fact that two-thirds of consumers have not made significant changes to their spending on snacks although they are more conscious of price. Recently, consumers have cut back spending on non-essential items which has negatively impacted sales for Starbucks and McDonald’s. However, the threat doesn't seem major to the snacking industry as snacking giants still see snacking as a large, attractive, and durable category that continues to grow in importance with consumers. A piece of important news surfacing in the market just before the year's end, as reported by CNBC, is that the Oreo maker has made a preliminary takeover approach for Hershey according to those familiar with the matter. The company had previously made a takeover bid for Hershey in 2016 which Hershey’s board unanimously rejected. The acquisition, if it takes place, is going to result in one of the biggest confectionery companies globally. While the combined business could be a huge deal, the question about it competing against the recent Mars’ acquisition of Kellanova which is expected to materialize in the coming year, is circulating all around. This acquisition is a great deal in the global snacking market as well since it ranks among the top 10 global food and beverage mergers and acquisitions since 1995, as revealed by Dealogic. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best cookies and crackers stocks to buy, we went through stock screeners, relevant ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks.

The global beverage and convenience food market presents the firm with a promising opportunity to further grow. Despite tough conditions including business disruptions due to rising geopolitical tensions in certain international markets and subdued category performance trends in North America, the firm closed a resilient third quarter of 2024. The quarter was marked with 1.3% organic revenue growth, 110 basis points expansion in core gross margin, and 75 basis points expansion in core operating margin versus the previous year. While consumers remain choiceful and value-conscious due to inflationary pressures, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) continues to accelerate its existing productivity programs by expanding automation at its plants, warehouses, and distribution centers, advancing digitalization across its organization, maximizing labor efficiencies, and minimizing areas of waste. While a strong pipeline of productivity initiatives is in place, the firm expects inflationary pressures to moderate versus the preceding year. Although the firm has been through multiple challenges since 2019, the long-term resilience of its categories and businesses is evident from the fact its net revenue has grown to more than $90 billion and it remains on track to deliver more than 45 percent core USD earnings per share growth in 2024 versus 2019. Overall PEP ranks 2nd on our list of the best cookies and crackers stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Dominating Wall Street Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating Wall Street. The Generative AI market, a crucial branch of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing entire industries today. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the Gen-AI market was valued at USD 20.21 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 440 billion by 2032. This signifies an impressive CAGR of 41.31% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032. READ NOW: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street According to the report, the North American region leads the Generative AI market with a 34% share in 2023. Its robust technology ecosystem, skilled workforce, and increasing demand for AI-powered content are responsible for the leading market share. The European region has also been experiencing growth, driven by government funding, startup innovation, and region-specific applications. Back in 2022, the generative AI market was dominated by established players only. These established players accounted for 88% of the market share, whereas start-ups grasped only 12%. This is now changing, with more players entering the market with each passing year. Highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, CEO of AI Company OpenAI states how the next innovations in AI are going to be more disruptive than people can imagine. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, he stated that the industry may begin to see examples of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine similar to that of a human, as soon as 2025. “I think it’s possible… in 2025 we will have systems that we look at… and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected” Altman noted that at first, the introduction of AGI, and the level of intelligence beyond it, is going to have minimal effect. However, it will later “be more intense than people think”. In its latest advancements in AI, OpenAI has now begun testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini. This demonstrates a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models proficient at solving complex problems. According to Altman, OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 after that. The enhanced models aim to outperform existing ones, driving new investments and user growth. The new o3 and o3 mini models are currently undergoing internal safety testing, and are anticipated to be more powerful than the o1 models. OpenAI has ignited a competitive AI arms race, pushing tech companies worldwide to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI technologies.

According to the firm, software stocks are going to have a “slower start out of the gate” in 2025. This is because investors will be recalibrating and adjusting to changes under the new administration. For most of these stocks, benefits from artificial intelligence will likely start to materialize in late 2025. Furthermore, the firm also states that cybersecurity “should prove more resilient” in the first half of 2025 based on strong fundamentals.

The Generative AI market, a crucial branch of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing entire industries today. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the Gen-AI market was valued at USD 20.21 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 440 billion by 2032. This signifies an impressive CAGR of 41.31% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032. READ NOW: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street According to the report, the North American region leads the Generative AI market with a 34% share in 2023. Its robust technology ecosystem, skilled workforce, and increasing demand for AI-powered content are responsible for the leading market share. The European region has also been experiencing growth, driven by government funding, startup innovation, and region-specific applications. Back in 2022, the generative AI market was dominated by established players only. These established players accounted for 88% of the market share, whereas start-ups grasped only 12%. This is now changing, with more players entering the market with each passing year. Highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, CEO of AI Company OpenAI states how the next innovations in AI are going to be more disruptive than people can imagine. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, he stated that the industry may begin to see examples of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine similar to that of a human, as soon as 2025. “I think it’s possible… in 2025 we will have systems that we look at… and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected” Altman noted that at first, the introduction of AGI, and the level of intelligence beyond it, is going to have minimal effect. However, it will later “be more intense than people think”. In its latest advancements in AI, OpenAI has now begun testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini. This demonstrates a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models proficient at solving complex problems. According to Altman, OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 after that. The enhanced models aim to outperform existing ones, driving new investments and user growth. The new o3 and o3 mini models are currently undergoing internal safety testing, and are anticipated to be more powerful than the o1 models. OpenAI has ignited a competitive AI arms race, pushing tech companies worldwide to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI technologies.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) is a technology company that provides high-performance computing (HPC) systems, software, and data storage solutions. On December 19, Deutsche Bank analyst Matt Niknam upgraded HP Enterprise (HPE) to “Buy” from Hold with an unchanged price target of $25. The buy rating is justified given the company’s attractive valuation and potential gains from the proposed Juniper acquisition slated to close in early 2025. The $5 billion Juniper deal is expected to expand HPE's higher-margin networking business and result in significant cost synergies. “We view the proposed Juniper acquisition positively, given the newfound scale the deal brings HPE in higher-margin networking, alongside sizable cost synergies”. The analyst also told investors in a research note that HPE’s standalone operations are also improving. This is driven by stronger artificial intelligence and server sales, along with growth in the hybrid cloud and its existing networking segment. Overall HPE ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks dominating Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of HPE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HPE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reaffirmed Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a top stock pick for 2025, maintaining its Overweight rating and a price target of $166. Despite some near-term headwinds, including a slowdown in Hopper builds and staggered Blackwell product readiness, Morgan Stanley views these challenges as temporary. By the second half of 2025, the strength of Blackwell will be “the only topic,” the firm’s analysts stressed. Addressing competitive pressures from ASIC solutions, particularly from Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Morgan Stanley believes purchasing trends will favor GPUs over time. “While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year,” analysts noted. The report also highlights Nvidia’s $12 billion annual R&D investments as critical for maintaining its leadership in AI hardware and system-level innovations. Analysts also addressed the concerns over industry challenges, including scaling Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) clusters. While technologists advocate for larger AGI systems, financial backers remain cautious about return on investment (ROI). Nvidia’s innovations, such as Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) and NV-Link, are positioned to improve efficiency in this area. Nvidia’s growth drivers—including inference, sovereign AI training, and enterprise applications—account for 70% of its data center revenue. Analysts believe these segments will continue driving growth even amid potential industry consolidation by 2026. “Even with some consolidation in the arms race, we should still see enduring growth potential,” they commented. The upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2025 is expected to boost sentiment for Nvidia. Analysts anticipate the messaging will emphasize strong Blackwell demand, albeit with supply constraints. “But by mid year we remain comfortable that the focus will remain on Blackwell which will be the driving force behind revenue in 2h, potentially unlocking more significant upside,” the note concluded. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has experienced an extraordinary rally since the U.S. election, solidifying its status as the market's "narrative king," according to analysts at Barclays (LON:BARC). The electric vehicle (EV) maker's shares have surged approximately 90%, adding about $730 billion to its market capitalization - a feat matched only by a few tech giants like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Barclays notes that this performance is particularly remarkable given the stock's apparent disconnect from underlying fundamentals. Tesla's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has soared from 80x before the election to an elevated 145x based on 2025 consensus EPS estimates. “The decoupling from fundamentals in many ways mirrors the rally we saw from Tesla in 2020-21," analysts led by Dan Levy said in a note. They attribute this rally to the "magnification of Tesla's narrative command," which centers around themes like autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI. Another factor contributing to the surge is the "Tesla-financial complex," where options activity amplifies stock movements. Moreover, retail investor interest remains robust, with 30% of Tesla's outstanding shares held by individual investors, according to Barclays. “Tesla remains the 'OG meme stock,'” the analysts emphasized. Barclays also pointed out the growth of the "Elon premium" in Tesla's valuation. The increased prominence of CEO Elon Musk has elevated interest in the company, translating to heightened enthusiasm for Tesla's stock. Bank of America (BofA) downgraded Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) to Neutral from Buy, citing a weaker-than-anticipated gross margin (GM) outlook for the second and third fiscal quarters. Shares of the chipmaker fell sharply Thursday after delivering disappointing Q2 guidance. Micron projects second-quarter revenue of approximately $7.9 billion, missing both BofA's $8.3 billion estimate and the consensus forecast of $9 billion. The company also expects a Q2 GM of 38.5%, below BofA's 40% estimate and the consensus of 41%. “Data center and HBM trends remain strong but weakness in PC and phone markets are putting downward pressure on memory pricing, especially in NAND,” BofA analysts led by Vivek Arya noted. Persistent pricing challenges in NAND are expected to extend into the third quarter. Although BofA remains optimistic about Micron's position in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and AI markets, it lowered its fiscal 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share estimates by 5% and 11%, respectively, to $6.80 and $8.78. The stock's price target was also cut to $110 from $125. “Historically the stock has struggled to outperform when GM expansion has remained muted, leading to our stock downgrade to Neutral from Buy, even though we still feel positive about MU’s position in the HBM/AI market where TAM was taken up +20% for CY25 to $30bn.” While data center and HBM trends are highlighted as strong, the weakness in PC and phone markets continues to weigh on memory pricing, particularly NAND. BofA does, however, see potential for recovery in these markets in the latter half of 2025. Monness, Crespi, and Hardt downgraded Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Sell from Neutral, setting a 12-month price target of $130, implying over 22% upside from the current levels. The firm raised concerns about Oracle's valuation, rising competition, and aggressive capital expenditure (capex) plans. Oracle shares have climbed 60% year-to-date, largely driven by generative AI enthusiasm, marking their best performance since 1999. However, Monness analysts warned that "valuation is stretched, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile." Oracle's recent Q2 earnings highlighted growth challenges, the firm noted. Its FY25 EPS estimate of $6.17 remains unchanged, while its FY25 Cloud Services revenue projection has been revised to $24.9 billion, down from last year’s $25.4 billion forecast. Monness expressed particular concern over Oracle’s “bold capex plans,” with spending expected to double in FY25. "Our current FY:25 capex projection of $14.2 billion represents 24.6% of revenue, up from 13% in FY:24, and well above the 27-year average of 4%," the analysts wrote. They argue this level of expenditure is unsustainable, dragging Oracle’s free cash flow (FCF) margin to an estimated 8% for FY25, far below its historical average of 28%. The firm also pointed to Oracle’s heavily leveraged balance sheet, with $88.6 billion in debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 86%. This restricts the company’s ability to boost shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks and limits its capacity for acquisitions or broader organic growth investments. While Oracle has seen early success in generative AI, Monness cautioned that "an inevitable shakeout in the LLM industry" and intensifying competition from major cloud providers could pose significant risks. Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and EV leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Dominating Wall Street Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating Wall Street. The Generative AI market, a crucial branch of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing entire industries today. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the Gen-AI market was valued at USD 20.21 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 440 billion by 2032. This signifies an impressive CAGR of 41.31% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032. READ NOW: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street According to the report, the North American region leads the Generative AI market with a 34% share in 2023. Its robust technology ecosystem, skilled workforce, and increasing demand for AI-powered content are responsible for the leading market share. The European region has also been experiencing growth, driven by government funding, startup innovation, and region-specific applications. Back in 2022, the generative AI market was dominated by established players only. These established players accounted for 88% of the market share, whereas start-ups grasped only 12%. This is now changing, with more players entering the market with each passing year. Highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, CEO of AI Company OpenAI states how the next innovations in AI are going to be more disruptive than people can imagine. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, he stated that the industry may begin to see examples of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine similar to that of a human, as soon as 2025. “I think it’s possible… in 2025 we will have systems that we look at… and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected” Altman noted that at first, the introduction of AGI, and the level of intelligence beyond it, is going to have minimal effect. However, it will later “be more intense than people think”. In its latest advancements in AI, OpenAI has now begun testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini. This demonstrates a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models proficient at solving complex problems. According to Altman, OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 after that. The enhanced models aim to outperform existing ones, driving new investments and user growth. The new o3 and o3 mini models are currently undergoing internal safety testing, and are anticipated to be more powerful than the o1 models. OpenAI has ignited a competitive AI arms race, pushing tech companies worldwide to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI technologies. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Title: Trump’s historic chance to bring peace

No matter what you think of Trump, he proved his ability to perform miracles. The first was on November 8, 2016, when, being a businessman and political novice, he defeated Washington insider, former secretary of state, and former first lady Hillary Clinton. He did it contrary to all polls, performing one of the biggest political upsets in American history. Trump’s second miracle occurred on November 5, 2024, when he won the presidential election in a landslide despite over a hundred lawsuits and thirty-four felony convictions, along with charges of fraud, election subversion, and obstruction. Trump could get 187 years in jail for all these crimes. Add to his misfortunes two attempts on his life. It looks as if someone is watching him from above. Now the big question is whether we will witness the third Trump miracle: ending the war in Ukraine, thus becoming a peacemaker and saving the world from Armageddon. Of course, he cannot do too much before January 20, when he moves into the White House, except plan different scenarios, which means that Biden and Co. still have a few weeks to mess around. Almost everyone agrees that if we survive until January 20, some deal seems likely, but the devil is in the details. The war party is not ready to give up the idea of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia, claiming that anything short of total West victory would only embolden Russia, which will invade NATO countries in the not so distant future, and also compound the threats from China, Iran, and North Korea. No one admits that had Washington accepted Ukraine’s neutral status, Russia would not have invaded in the first place. Many well known American experts, including members of Congress, emphasize that the U.S. would do the same to Mexico if it had decided to join an anti-American military alliance with Russia or China. Also, contrary to the U.S., neither China nor Iran, nor North Korea, is on the record invading other countries. For the war party, using relatively cheap Ukrainian cannon fodder is an additional incentive. Indeed, so far, there have been no American casualties, and Washington has spent around 300 billion dollars on this war. However, during the post-9/11 “War on Terror,” according to Brown University’s “Costs of War” research, over 27 thousand U.S. and allied military troops were killed, and close to 8 trillion U.S. taxpayer funds were spent. Many U.S. companies, like BlackRock, have already acquired many Ukrainian lands and natural resources and are not ready to give them up if Trump considers this part of the deal. He still has a month to strategize, and plenty of solicited or unsolicited scenarios are floating around. Everyone understands that Zelensky’s dreams of NATO membership are unrealistic. At least seven NATO countries, including the United States, are reported to oppose Ukraine’s entry or want to defer it indefinitely. Some European leaders could pledge to send their military to Ukraine as peacekeepers. Still, considering their low ratings, this idea would be less popular at home, especially since Trump said to count America out of this group. He and the people he has picked for the most senior positions in foreign policy and national security are primarily concerned about China, and they want to delegate Europe taking responsibility when dealing with Ukraine. According to the New York Times, another possible model — arms neutrality — would require Russia to pledge not to attack Ukraine and for Ukraine to forswear both NATO membership and the deployment of foreign troops and armaments on its soil. It may also be the most achievable outcome, since Putin has said neutrality is essential for “good-neighborly relations.” It may be hard to imagine such relations between Russia and Ukraine at this time, but if, on January 21, Trump calls Putin and suggests a summit, they could make a historic deal. The meeting place could be somewhere in Europe. Budapest, considering its peace initiatives, would be one of the most preferred locations. This horrible war has continued for more than 1,000 days. It has killed hundreds of thousands, displaced millions, destroyed large parts of Ukraine, and threatened nuclear Armageddon. It is time to end it. If Trump performs his third miracle, he will grow his place in the annals of American and world history. Image via Raw Pixel.

Title: Bitcoin Drops Below $100,000: The End Or Beginning Of The Crypto Bull Market?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-drops-below-100000-the-end-or-beginning-of-the-crypto-bull-market/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T04:30:38Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin, the titan of the cryptocurrency world with a market cap hovering around $1.9 trillion, has experienced a significant downturn, dipping below the psychological threshold of $100,000. This flash dump, occurring over just three days, has left many investors and analysts questioning whether this marks the end of the current bull market or signals a healthy correction within an ongoing bullish trend. The price action has been particularly notable this week, with Bitcoin breaking through the $100,000 support level, which had held strong for eight consecutive days. Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this decline. One significant influence is the market makers’ strategy, which involved driving the price upward to encourage traders to open long positions at around $98,000, thereby increasing liquidity. After exhausting this liquidity, market makers strategically used Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech as a catalyst to drive a downward price movement, effectively filling the price inefficiencies at $93,744 (50%) and $90,513 (100%). Analysts explained, “The Bitcoin drop was necessary as there were inefficiencies below the price that needed to be filled, which are $93,744 for 50% and $90,513 for 100%. The inefficiency rule states that traders must fill either 50% or 100% of the inefficiency.” They added that market makers “purposely took the price upward to induce traders to open long positions, thereby increasing the liquidity at $98,000. Exhausted market makers decided to wipe out the liquidity at $98,800 and used Powell’s speech as a catalyst to fuel the downward movement.” Experts now predict a bounce to $101,000 before either a pullback or a continuation of the trend, as the $93,788-$92,200 range currently acts as robust support. This zone has seen significant buy orders, aligning with the 50% inefficiency recently filled. A bounce from this level appears inevitable. Amid the volatility, BlackRock, one of the world’s leading asset management firms, has made headlines for its substantial investments in Bitcoin. According to insights from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock has not only net bought Bitcoin while other ETFs were selling but has also amassed a considerable amount, now holding 122.6K BTC. This makes BlackRock the 11th largest holder of Bitcoin, controlling roughly 0.6% of the circulating supply. Their aggressive accumulation, including a recent $1.5 billion purchase, contrasts sharply with the broader market’s net selling of $785 million in BTC this week. BlackRock’s actions have sparked discussions on platforms like X, with many applauding or humorously noting their transition from traditional assets to digital currencies. Additionally, BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto market was underscored by their BUIDL Fund receiving $100 million USDC, signaling a strategic pivot towards digital assets. Such a heavyweight in finance could interpret this move as a vote of confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies, potentially influencing market sentiment and dynamics. The market’s current sentiment, as measured by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in the ‘greed’ zone at 62, indicating minimal fear among investors. Instead, the dip below $100,000 is viewed by many as a buying opportunity, with expectations of an imminent recovery. Analysts predict a bounce back to around $101,000 before any significant pullback or continuation of the current trend, supported by robust buying at the $93,788-$92,200 range, which aligns with the recently filled 50% inefficiency level.

Title: Is The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) the Best Dividend Stock for Steady Income?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other dividend stocks. Generating income has consistently been a primary goal for investors. To achieve this, they often opt for investments that provide steady and reliable returns over time. Dividend stocks are particularly popular in this regard, as they are well-regarded for offering regular income. Although using cash payouts from a stock portfolio is a popular approach among individuals nearing retirement, building an equity income portfolio is an option available to anyone. Over the years, dividends have significantly enhanced investors' overall returns, making these stocks a compelling choice for income-focused portfolios. In certain periods, especially when equity returns fell below 10%, dividends have accounted for more than half of the total returns of major market indices, according to LSEG data. Investors are increasingly emphasizing the quality of a company's earnings. Examining factors such as dividends per share, dividend growth, and the stability of dividend payments can provide valuable insights into a company's financial stability. Those who prioritize businesses with lower debt levels and higher profitability often target well-established, financially robust firms with greater flexibility. These high-quality companies typically demonstrate stronger resilience during market downturns and are more likely to sustain earnings growth across different market conditions. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Wall Street Analysts According to a report by BlackRock, historically, stocks that consistently grew or maintained their dividends have delivered better performance compared to those that either did not pay dividends or reduced their payouts. During market downturns, dividend-paying stocks often provide a buffer against the volatility of share prices. Companies that issue dividends typically strive to maintain these payments and are generally reluctant to reduce them unless absolutely unavoidable. When investing in dividend stocks, investors often evaluate the dividend yield. Experts recommend focusing on yields within the 3% to 6% range, as higher yields may indicate potential yield traps. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, has also emphasized this point. Here are some comments from the analyst: “I generally like to advocate for an approach of targeting great businesses that might pay closer to a 3% to 4% dividend yield.” He further mentioned that these companies tend to gradually increase their payouts, which can enhance annual income streams and help counter the impact of inflation. Regarding companies with lower yields, he noted that they are often associated with more secure businesses and more reliable dividend payments. For example, the Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has an indicated yield of 2.28%. According to Bollinger, many of the firms in this index are well-established and financially stable. He suggested that creating a diversified portfolio of these companies can provide reassurance, as it builds a solid foundation for a growing stream of passive income, regardless of market fluctuations. He further said: “When stock prices fall, it’s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you’re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don’t care so much about the markets’ short-term ups and downs anymore.” As a result, investors often include dividend stocks in their portfolios. Our Methodology: For this list, we first filtered dividend stocks that have shown at least 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this group, we selected those with dividend yields above 1.5% as of December 20. Lastly, we chose 10 companies that have achieved a share price return of over 30% over the past five years. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields as of December 20. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies. Dividend Yield as of December 20: 2.32% 5-Year Share Price Return: 75.2% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) ranks seventh on our list of the best stocks with steady dividends. The American multinational home improvement retail company sells appliances, tools, construction equipment, and related products. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported $40.22 billion in revenue, reflecting a 6.6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. The company recorded an operating income of $5.4 billion with an operating margin of 13.5%. Growth was supported by stronger customer interest in seasonal items and outdoor projects, as well as increased sales driven by hurricane-related demand. This year, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) encountered difficulties stemming from growing macroeconomic uncertainty, which weakened consumer demand and resulted in lower spending on home improvement projects. In the most recent quarter, same-store sales dropped by 1.3% compared to the previous year—an unfavorable result for a retail-driven business. Management expects this declining trend to continue through the rest of the fiscal year. That said, the stock has surged by over 13.5% since the start of 2024. This was also highlighted by Carillon Tower Advisers in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “While Home Depot, Inc.’s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company’s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.” During the first nine months of the year, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) generated more than $15 billion in operating cash flow. This solid financial position enables the company to maintain its status as a generous dividend payer. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing payouts for the past 14 consecutive years. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.32%, as of December 20. Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024 indicated that 82 hedge funds held stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), compared with 86 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at nearly $7.6 billion. Overall HD ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks with steady dividends. While we acknowledge the potential of HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. Predictions of artificial intelligence reaching human-level intelligence have been made for over 50 years. Regardless, the quest to achieve it continues even today, with almost everyone working in the AI field being too focused on achieving it. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, reaching AGI isn’t a milestone we can define by a particular date.

People will wonder if is this AGI yet, or is this not AGI, or it’s just going to be this smooth exponential. And probably most people looking back in history won’t agree when that milestone was hit. And we’ll just realize it was like a silly thing”. In the latest innovations in artificial intelligence, new research has revealed how the upcoming AIs are capable of human deceit. Joint experiments conducted by AI Company Anthropic and the nonprofit Redwood Research reveal how Anthropic’s model, Claude is capable of strategically misleading its creators during the training process in order to avoid being modified. According to Evan Hubinger, a safety researcher at Anthropic, this will make it harder for scientists to align “AI systems” to human values. “This implies that our existing training processes don’t prevent models from pretending to be aligned”. Researchers have also found evidence that as AIs become more powerful, their capability to deceive their human creators also increases. Consequently, it means scientists would be less confident about the effectiveness of their alignment techniques as AI becomes more advanced. A similar research conducted by AI safety organization Apollo Research revealed how OpenAI’s latest model, o1, also intentionally deceived its testers during an experiment. The test required the model to achieve its goal at all costs, where it lied when it believed that telling the truth would ultimately lead to its deactivation. “There has been this long-hypothesized failure mode, which is that you’ll run your training process, and all the outputs will look good to you, but the model is plotting against you. The paper, Greenblatt says, “makes a pretty big step towards demonstrating what that failure mode could look like and how it could emerge naturally”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company known for its custom chip offerings and networking assets. On December 17, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a “Buy” rating on Broadcom with a price target of $240.00. The buy rating underscores Broadcom’s promising growth trajectory and strong market position. The company’s projected opportunities in the AI semiconductor market have increased proportionally. Moreover, it has also scored new custom compute clients, reinforcing its leadership in AI Ethernet connectivity. The company also demonstrated that it manages its infrastructure software segment effectively, as evident by VMware’s operating margins. Due to these factors, Hari has increased the 12-month price target for the stock. The Semiconductor Solutions segment continues to perform well, particularly in networking revenue, bolstering the positive outlook. All in all, overall growth and strategic position in enabling next-generation AI technologies support the Buy rating for the stock. Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Infratil Limited (NZSE:IFT) surges 5.3%; retail investors who own 58% shares profited along with institutions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Infratil's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public The top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Insiders have been buying lately Every investor in Infratil Limited (NZSE:IFT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 58% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Following a 5.3% increase in the stock price last week, retail investors profited the most, but institutions who own 37% stock also stood to gain from the increase. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Infratil, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Infratil Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Infratil. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Infratil's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Infratil. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 5.9%. With 3.9% and 3.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Fisher Funds Management Limited are the second and third largest shareholders. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Infratil Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth NZ$311m. Most would see this as a real positive. It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Infratil shares. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Infratil has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future. NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Title: Two major banks leave UN Net Zero Banking Alliance in two weeks
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4285778/posts
Time Published: 2024-12-21T18:43:47Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/21/2024 10:43:47 AM PST by george76 Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. According to the "bank-led and UN-convened" NZBA, global banks joined the alliance, pledging to align their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, NZBA explains. Since April 2021, 145 banks in 44 countries with more than $73 trillion in assets have joined NZBA, tripling membership in three years. "In April 2021 when NZBA launched, no bank had set a science-based sectoral 2030 target for its financed emissions using 1.5°C scenarios," it says. "Today, over half of NZBA banks have set such targets." There are two less on the list. Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance this month, ESG Today reported. Wells Fargo was the second, announcing its departure Friday. The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

According to the "bank-led and UN-convened" NZBA, global banks joined the alliance, pledging to align their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, NZBA explains. Since April 2021, 145 banks in 44 countries with more than $73 trillion in assets have joined NZBA, tripling membership in three years. "In April 2021 when NZBA launched, no bank had set a science-based sectoral 2030 target for its financed emissions using 1.5°C scenarios," it says. "Today, over half of NZBA banks have set such targets." There are two less on the list. Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance this month, ESG Today reported. Wells Fargo was the second, announcing its departure Friday. The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

"Today, over half of NZBA banks have set such targets." There are two less on the list. Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance this month, ESG Today reported. Wells Fargo was the second, announcing its departure Friday. The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The banks withdrew two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them and four other institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. Four states led the investigation: Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri and Texas. Others involved include Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Five state investigations aren't public for confidentiality reasons. The investigation was the third launched by Texas AG Ken Paxton into deceptive trade practices connected to ESG, which he argues were designed to negatively impact the Texas oil and natural gas industry. The industry is the lifeblood of the Texas economy and major economic engine for the country and world, The Center Square has reported. The Texas oil and natural gas industry accounts for nearly one-third of Texas's GDP and funds more than 10% of the state's budget. It generates over 43% of the electricity in the U.S. and 51% in Texas, according to 2023 data from the Energy Information Administration. It continues to break production records, emissions reduction records and job creation records, leading the nation in all three categories, The Center Square reported.Last year, the industry paid the largest amount in tax revenue in state history of more than $26.3 billion.This translated to $72 million a day to fund public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other services. "The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry," Paxton said in 2022 when launching Texas' investigation. "If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they're dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won't stop until we get to the truth."' Paxton praised Wells Fargo's move to withdraw from "an anti-energy activist organization that requires its members to prioritize a radical climate agenda over consumer and investor interests." Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Under Texas law, financial institutions that boycott the oil and natural gas industry are prohibited from entering into contracts with state governmental entities. State law also requires state entities to divest from financial companies that boycott the oil and natural gas industry by implementing ESG policies. To date, 17 companies and 353 publicly traded investment funds are on Texas' ESG divestment list. After financial institutions withdraw from the NZBA, they are permitted to do business with Texas, Paxton said. He also urged other financial institutions to follow suit and "end ESG policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries." Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has expressed skepticism about companies claiming to withdraw from ESG commitments noting there is often doublespeak in their announcements, The Center Square reported. Notably, when leaving the alliance, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the company was still committed to the NZBA goals and has "the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients," EST Today reported. The company also said it was "very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world." "Goldman Sachs also confirmed that its goal to align its financing activities with net zero by 2050, and its interim sector-specific targets remained in place," EST Today reported. Five Goldman Sachs funds are listed in Texas' ESG divestment list. The Comptroller's office remains committed to "enforcing the laws of our state as passed by the Texas Legislature," Hegar said. "Texas tax dollars should not be invested in a manner that undermines our state's economy or threatens key Texas industries and jobs."

Title: Robert Kiyosaki: ‘Everything Bubble’ Is About To Burst — How To Prepare

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In a series of tweets on Oct. 14, “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki warned of an impending collapse of the “everything bubble” — his term for the inflation that has not only driven up home price and costs of consumer goods, butassets such as gold, silver, bitcoin and stocks, as well. When the everything bubble bursts, Kiyosaki warned, an “everything crash” will bring suffering on the unprepared. Find Out: 10 Things the Middle Class Won’t Be Able To Afford in Less Than a Decade Read Next: The Salary Needed To Afford America’s 50 Biggest Cities Kiyosaki’s predictions are rooted in his belief that the dollar is a “fake” store of value, so consumers should invest money in appreciating assets instead of saving it in a bank account. But rather than invest in the stock market — which he also considers a fake store of value — he says physical assets like gold, silver and bitcoin are the way to go. Kiyosaki recommended buying these assets when the markets for them crash so that you can get rich when prices recover and their values appreciate. Before you sell off your stock and transfer your savings to a cryptocurrency exchange, it’s important to understand Kiyosaki’s track record when it comes to forecasting market crashes. A U.S. News & World Report analysis looked at 11 such predictions from April 2011 to May 2024, when he proclaimed, “BAD News: CRASH has BEGUN,” and found that he was incorrect 100% of the time. Even economists have trouble predicting market crashes, but there’s no denying the economy undergoes cycles. In its fourth-quarter 2024 update, Fidelity identified the U.S. as being in the latter part of the cycle, where growth slows. Sooner or later, it’ll hit a trough that could trigger a market correction. Learn More: 3 Signs You’ve ‘Made It’ Financially, According to Financial Influencer Genesis Hinckley While cashing in your stocks is probably a terrible idea that you shouldn’t consider without consulting with a financial planner and/or tax advisor, investing in gold, silver and cryptocurrency might be smart regardless of where you believe the market is headed. Precious metals like gold and silver diversify your portfolio. Gold is the stronger of the two in that regard, according to Morgan Stanley, because it’s less volatile and less sensitive to global economies. Experts generally recommend, according to CBS News, that gold comprise up to 10% of your portfolio. Cryptocurrency, and bitcoin in particular, also provide diversification. A Fidelity study found that from Aug. 1, 2010 through March 31, 2024, bitcoin returned 178% per year, on average, which far surpassed annualized returns on stocks. However, bitcoin is less of a hedge than previously thought. Rather than move opposite the market, it has tended to move in the same direction, but reach higher highs and lower lows. For a traditional portfolio with a 60%/40% mix of stocks and bonds, Blackrock recommends allocating no more than 2% to bitcoin[x].Here are more tips for preparing your finances for an “everything crash,” according to Merrill Lynch: Avoid panic selling. Your losses are paper losses only until you sell. Once your shares are gone, you have no chance to recoup your investment. Rebalance your portfolio. Over time, differences in how assets appreciate can throw your investment mix out of whack. Rebalancing restores the mix to the strategy you intended. Keep investing. Regular investing protects your portfolio through dollar-cost averaging. Over time, you’ll buy more shares at lower prices, and fewer shares when prices are up. Build an emergency fund. Granted, inflation reduces the purchasing power of cash you hold in a savings account, but the best high-yield savings accounts earn more than 4% annual percentage yield, with no risk to the cash itself. That savings can keep you from having to rely on expensive credit should you lose your job or need an expensive home or car repair. Pay down debt. Eliminating debt frees up cash you can save or invest. It also frees up your available credit for use in an emergency your savings can’t cover.

The mission was Rocket Lab's 16th launch for the year and sixth launch to date for Japanese Earth-observation company Synspective MAHIA, New Zealand--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (Rocket Lab or the Company), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it successfully completed the Company's 16th launch for the year, deploying a satellite for Japanese Earth-observation constellation operator Synspective. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241221492452/en/ Rocket Lab successfully launches its 16th Electron rocket of the year, deploying a satellite to orbit for Japanese constellation operator Synspective. (Photo: Business Wire) The Owl The Way Up mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand on 22 December at 03:17 NZT deploying a single StriX satellite to orbit from the Electron launch vehicle. The mission was the sixth in a total of 16 launches booked on Electron for Synspective, an Earth observation company operating a constellation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites designed to deliver imagery that can detect millimetre-level changes to the Earth's surface from space. Rocket Lab first launched for Synspective in December 2020 and has been the sole launch provider for Synspective's constellation to date. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: Mission success once again for Synspective, capping off our busiest launch year to date. We look forward to continuing to increase our launch cadence in the new year as we strengthen Electron's position as the leading small rocket globally, and also enter the medium launch market with Neutron's debut. In 2024 we launched missions for NASA, the NRO, deployed multiple missions for commercial constellation operators like Synspective, launched suborbital HASTE missions advancing hypersonic flight test capability, and to top it all off, we achieved a world first by launching two missions from two different hemispheres in less than 24 hours. Thank you and congratulations to the Rocket Lab team, our customers, and our mission partners for another stellar year. Rocket Lab launched 16 missions in 2024, besting the Company's previous annual launch record of 10 missions, achieved in 2023 and representing a launch cadence increase of 60% year-on-year. Rocket Lab maintained a record of 100% mission success for all launches in 2024.

Title: AppLovin Stock (APP) May Struggle for More Momentum after 687% Rally

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I invested in AppLovin (APP) when the company was worth less than $15 billion. Today, that figure stands at over $113 billion after a 687% rally over 12 months. However, I’m a little concerned that the momentum might be running low simply because the company’s valuation may prove unsustainable unless it can present further catalysts. For now, I’m neutral on this stock, given the evolving interest rate environment, the potential for more risk-off sentiment, and the stock’s valuation. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter While I’m now neutral on the stock, I have to note that the company’s rise has been nothing short of remarkable. AppLovin’s ascent in the mobile advertising and gaming industry can be attributed to several key factors. At the heart of its success is the AI-powered Axon engine, which has revolutionized ad targeting and delivery. This innovative technology, which was something of an unknown entity at first, continuously learns and refines data, ensuring ads reach the right audience at the optimal time, significantly boosting user engagement and ad effectiveness. AppLovin’s strategic focus on the mobile gaming sector, a market projected for substantial growth, has been central to the company’s success. Moreover, AppLovin’s unique combination of gaming development expertise and targeted advertising capabilities gives it a competitive edge over traditional ad platforms. In turn, its financial performance has impressed the market, with AppLovin reporting a 39% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.2 billion in Q3 2024. Meanwhile, earnings per share more than quadrupled to $1.25, with Q3 earnings beating expectations by an incredible $0.33. Looking forward, the company’s expansion into new verticals, particularly e-commerce, presents significant growth opportunities, as leveraging its AI capabilities in these new sectors could further drive its success. I’m currently neutral on AppLovin because, despite its impressive profitability and growth prospects, the valuation is hard to justify. The company’s financial metrics paint a picture of a high-performing business with significant potential, yet the current market valuation appears to be pricing in extraordinary future performance. Starting with the positives, AppLovin presents exceptional profitability metrics, with an EBIT margin of 35.8% and a net income margin of 26.8%, both significantly above the sector median. The company’s revenue growth is equally impressive, with a 41.5% year-over-year increase, far surpassing the sector median of 4.4%. It’s an efficient operator, and the business is growing considerably. However, the valuation metrics are exceedingly rich. The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 64.8x is 159.5% higher than the sector median. Similarly, the forward EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 63.9x is 198% above the sector median. These ratios suggest that investors are expecting exceptional earnings growth in the coming years. While AppLovin’s consensus earnings growth estimates are very strong, with projected growth rates of 313.5% for 2024 and 46.5% for 2025, the current valuation demands sustained exceptional growth throughout the medium term. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.6, which is 43.3% higher than the sector median, indicates that the stock could be overvalued relative to its expected growth. For AppLovin’s valuation to be justified, the company would need to consistently outperform these already high expectations, delivering massive earnings beats in the coming quarters and years. Interestingly, the market’s expectation for the current quarter is in line with the $1.25 delivered in Q3. If this forecast turns out to be correct, it would be the first time in eight quarters that earnings have not improved sequentially. My hunch is that AppLovin will surprise again to the upside. However, it may need to be a considerable beat in order to justify the valuation and generate more share price momentum. My concerns about AppLovin’s share price momentum are also impacted by the Federal Reserve’s signaling that there will be fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. The announcement on Wednesday, December 20, resulted in the AppLovin share price falling around 7%. On TipRanks, APP comes in as a Moderate Buy based on 14 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell assigned by analysts in the past three months. Furthermore, the average APP stock price target is $323.67, implying 4.24% downside risk. See more APP analyst ratings AppLovin’s rise has been nothing short of sensational. However, despite great profitability metrics, strong growth expectations, and new verticals, I’m neutral on the stock that has brought me such strong returns. The company’s impressive Q3 2024 performance, with $1.2 billion in revenue and a 39% year-over-year increase, highlights its potential. Yet, the stock’s valuation raises significant concerns. With a forward P/E ratio that is 159% above the sector median and an EV/EBITDA multiple suggesting extraordinary expectations, AppLovin stock will likely lack momentum unless we see a huge earnings beat. While its AI-powered technology and expansion strategies are promising, it’s hard to invest more in this stock right now. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, AI: 'Going Vertical'
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/balaji-srinivasan-on-bitcoin-ai-going-vertical-3785856
Time Published: 2024-12-21T15:30:22Z

U.Today - Renowned tech visionary Balaji Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and GP of Andreessen Horowitz, shows two charts to display the rocketing opportunities of AI large language models (LLMs) and Bitcoin ETFs. Both are in their "vertical" growth phases, he says. To demonstrate the traction of Bitcoin (BTC) and AI, Srinivasan shared two charts. The first one demonstrates the opportunities of OpenAI's flagship models to solve various tasks. It is measured by Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmarks. Yesterday, Dec. 20, 2024, OpenAI's much-anticipated o3 model set a new record, hitting 87.5% on ARC-AGI public data set. As demonstrated by Balaji Srinivasan, this is a 10x more powerful result compared to GPT-4o, the strongest of ChatGPT's mainstream models today. In turn, GPT-4o performs 500% better than GPT-3, the model that kickstarted the AI euphoria in 2023. The second chart by Balaji Srinivasan showcases the dynamics of USD-denominated AUM of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares ETFs on Gold and spot Bitcoin. Launched less than one year ago, BlackRock's Bitcoin spot ETFs exceeded their Gold-based predecessors by almost 73%. Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. were approved Jan. 11, 2024. In total, they amassed $113 billion in AUM across 21 products. Commenting on Balaji Srinivasan's estimations, tech veteran and former Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski noticed that Bitcoin (BTC) might surpass the internet in adoption impetus. While Bitcoin (BTC) might already be growing faster than the internet, its adoption is near 1999 levels for Global Web, Knitowski's chart says. This article was originally published on U.Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News That Broke the Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against other AI news that broke the Internet. As AI continues to evolve, its influence on business will be undeniable, reshaping industries with smarter, more efficient solutions. Companies that embrace these trends will be better equipped to innovate, compete, and thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. According to Oliver Parker Vice President, Global Generative AI Go-To-Market, Google Cloud, artificial intelligence is set to significantly impact businesses in 2025, driving innovation and transforming operations. Key trends include multimodal AI, which combines text, audio, and visual data for more accurate and contextual analysis; AI agents that simplify complex workflows and support employees; improved enterprise search capabilities allowing users to access data through various media; improved customer experiences with personalized and predictive AI solutions; and stronger security systems powered by AI to detect threats and strengthen defenses. However, this progress also introduces challenges, especially in the realm of AI-driven security threats. READ ALSO: 10 Companies Hoarding Bitcoin Like There’s No Tomorrow and 9 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. The AI landscape is undergoing a significant shift, with a growing focus on algorithmic innovations and software applications rather than just scaling hardware. As generative AI models mature, startups and smaller companies are emerging as key players, driving efficiency and new use cases in the field. In the discussion on CNBC, Chetan Puttagunta from Benchmark and Deirdre Bosa of CNBC focused on the evolving AI landscape. Chetan highlighted that AI innovation is shifting from large-scale hardware investments to algorithmic advancements, especially at the model layer, with entrepreneurs pushing the frontier in inference and AI applications. He mentioned that recent investment trends are moving toward smaller startups focused on algorithmic breakthroughs, as opposed to just scaling hardware. Deirdre added that AI’s generative phase is transitioning from pre-training large models to leveraging existing models for real-world applications. This phase is characterized by a focus on software, with smaller companies gaining traction, especially with the rise of open-source models like Llama, allowing new startups to challenge established players. Chetan gives examples like Sierra, which is revolutionizing customer service by automating tasks and improving customer experiences. Both see a significant opportunity for new AI-first startups to disrupt traditional software companies. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115 Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) AI across several applications, including chatbots for customer service, NLP and machine learning for text analysis and model development, and advanced tools like AI translation and text-to-video creation. South China Morning Post reported that Alibaba Group has restructured its AI teams by separating the development of its chatbot, Tongyi Qianwen, from its large language model (LLM) research. The AI chatbot team will now operate under the Intelligent Information Platform, which focuses on consumer-facing products like the UC Browser and Quark search engine. Meanwhile, the LLM research division, Tongyi Lab, will remain part of Alibaba Cloud, dedicated to fundamental research and supporting specific products. This move reflects Alibaba’s efforts to boost consumer AI products and keep pace with the competitive AI market in China. Overall, BABA ranks 3rd on our list of AI news that broke the Internet. While we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Lemonade, Inc. (LMND): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Lemonade, Inc. (LMND) on Substack by Lorenzo Bastianelli. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LMND. Lemonade, Inc. (LMND)'s share was trading at $38.10 as of Dec 19th. An insurance agent at their desk consulting a customer about property & casualty insurance. Lemonade (LMND) is redefining the insurance industry by prioritizing growth and maximizing gross profit over achieving the lowest loss ratio, positioning itself as an AI-driven disruptor rather than a traditional insurer. Management’s strategy focuses on scaling the business and leveraging technology to unlock efficiencies, addressing critics who point to its loss ratio and lack of profitability. This vision was at the forefront of the recent investor day, where Lemonade outlined its ambitious plan to grow in-force premium (IFP) from $1 billion to $10 billion. CEO Daniel Schreiber emphasized Lemonade’s unique foundation as a technology-first insurer, free from legacy constraints, which enables it to innovate, delight customers, and reduce costs. A key competitive advantage lies in its ability to iterate rapidly, with 50 product updates released weekly—far beyond the capabilities of traditional insurers. This technological edge has bolstered Lemonade’s brand strength, with its renters and pet insurance ranking among the most searched in their categories, achieved with minimal marketing spend. Lemonade’s innovative "synthetic agents" financing model has further fueled its growth by funding customer acquisition efficiently while preserving direct relationships with customers. This approach eliminates the drawbacks of traditional agent models, ensuring financial efficiency and customer retention. Lemonade’s superior model is evident in its ability to decouple revenue growth from operational costs, creating a scalable platform with near-zero marginal costs. Car insurance represents the cornerstone of Lemonade’s growth strategy, leveraging continuous telematics to offer real-time data-driven pricing. This approach allows for precision in rates, rewarding safe driving while dynamically adjusting for risk, and supports aggressive pricing strategies to capture market share. Coupled with cross-selling opportunities across its portfolio, Lemonade is poised to accelerate growth with car insurance as a pivotal driver. The company has maintained a 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), with consistent acceleration quarter-over-quarter. Management projects this momentum will lead to EBITDA profitability by 2026 and net income profitability by 2027, underpinned by AI-driven efficiencies that have kept operating expenses flat despite the business’s expansion. Schreiber underscored Lemonade’s long-term vision, prioritizing growth to maximize enterprise value. By scaling its operations, the company intends to shift the profit frontier, leveraging its technological advantage for sustained profitability. With its innovative, tech-first approach, Lemonade is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious goals, paving the way to redefine the insurance industry while delivering substantial value to shareholders. Lemonade, Inc. (LMND) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 16 hedge fund portfolios held LMND at the end of the third quarter which was 17 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of LMND as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LMND but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pensacola Big Lots and Party City employees face sudden layoffs before holiday season

Now 58 Tue 66 Wed 65 by Hannah James TOPICS: PENSACOLA, Fla. -- Nearly 50 employees of both the Big Lots and Party City Pensacola locations are scrambling to find new jobs ahead of the holidays. WEAR News spoke with one employee who says he was given virtually no notice. And now, he's left in limbo. Major retail companies Party City and Big Lots gave their employees less than 24 hours notice that their companies were going to be shutting down. That happened five days before Christmas. Party City is closing all of its stores after 40 years of operation. Nearly 20 employees at the Pensacola location were told Friday that it will be their last day of employment. Employees at Big Lots faced a similar text from their CEO. Notification also came Thursday. "Our CEO got in contact with us all, and e-mail," says Big Lots employee Brent Smith. "My boss also sent us all an e-mail. That's how we were notified." In September, Big Lots announced its plan to sell its assets to the private equity firm, Nexus Capital Management. Thursday, the same day, Smith received a notification. The company announced the sale is unlikely to go through. "There's not an official date on store closure," Smith says. "But we just started today on getting the signs and stuff out like that." Smith has been working full-time at this Big Lots for seven years now. He and the nearly 30 employees are left to plan for the future with Christmas on the horizon. "Yeah, it's a horrible time. It's like a Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, kick in the butt," Smith says. "Yeah, no plans as of right now. Just looking around. Hopefully, we can find something here soon... My wife has been sick, so I've been trying to deal with that. So, it's been a crazy, crazy, year... A crazy couple of months." To the CEO of Big Lots, Smith shares the following message. "Good luck. Because we need the good luck as well," says Smith. "No hard feeling, but still kind of a kick in the butt for right around this time, because everybody is going to be hurting." Specifically for the Big Lots at Oak Village in Pensacola, they do not know the definitive closing date yet. Big Lots blamed several economic factors for its bankruptcy, including high inflation and interest rates, leading customers to change their purchasing behavior. Party City blames growing competition from online retailers, like Amazon and Walmart.

Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plummeted toward $90,000 per bitcoin, dragging the wider crypto market lower and wiping away around $500 billion worth of value from the $3.2 trillion crypto market. Bitcoin's drop of around 10% in the last 24 hours was dwarfed by ethereum and smaller, top ten cryptocurrencies—including solana and dogecoin—that crashed back by between 15% and 25%.

[+] bitcoin price and crypto market sell-off. This week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell disappointed traders when he warned interest rates would not come down as quickly as the Fed had previously thought, reducing its planned number of cuts to just two in 2025, from four previously. 12/21 update: The bitcoin price has bounced back, climbing to within touching distance of $100,000 per bitcoin after the latest inflation data from the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index showed a smaller than expected rise of 2.4% rise in November, just below the 2.5% estimate of economists polled by Reuters. Other major cryptocurrencies that had crashed lower, including ethereum, Ripple's XRP and dogecoin, also rebounded, with the combined market recovering around $300 billion of value as traders increase their bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, the founder of the Ark Investment Management hedge fund, reiterated her bullish bitcoin price prediction in a Bloomberg interview, forecasting that the bitcoin price will top $1 million by 2030—something that would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $20 trillion. "[Bitcoin] is becoming even more scarce than gold," Wood said. "The difference between gold and bitcoin is, when the gold price goes up, as it has, production goes up, the rate of increase in the supply goes up—that can not happen with bitcoin." Over the next few weeks, bitcoin and crypto market watchers expect the bitcoin price to remain prone to wild swings. "In terms of what is coming over the holiday period, the first rule of bitcoin is that it is always volatile in the same way water is always wet," James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments. "It’s behavior is always mixed and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year and going into the next. Sometimes the price rises in the new year and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year," Toledano added, pointing to incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration as an important date to watch for the bitcoin and crypto market. "Comments from the Federal Reserve were a wake-up call," Danni Hewson, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis, said in emailed comments.

"Breakthroughs in generative AI are bringing 3D perception, control, skill planning and intelligence to robots," Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's vice president of omniverse and simulation technology, told CNBC. "Humanoid robots will help close the gap as labor shortages increase around the world, especially in sectors like retail, warehousing and distribution or manufacturing." Some analysts say there's a bigger market for these kinds of robots than for robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles. And while advancements in autonomy have driven up the share price of stocks such as Tesla, analysts suspect not much value has been priced in for the potential of humanoid robots, creating an opportunity for investors who want to bet on the emerging technology. Adding to the bull case, some think President-elect Donald Trump's expected deportation efforts could be another boon to automated labor. The best use cases are yet to be determined. While the adoption of humanoid robots could pick up rapidly in factories, RBC analyst Tom Narayan sees the big upside coming from when — and if — humanoid robots can be part of a consumer's everyday life. The real opportunity is in "more than just cutting vegetables," he said. "I think the majority of the value [in humanoid robotics] is not on the industrial side. ... It would have to be on the consumer side, like in people's houses — like a personal assistant to help raise your kids or babysit," Narayan said in an interview. "In most manufacturing plants in the U.S., for example, robots are already working. If you look at auto, most of those plants are already largely automated." Predictions already anticipate massive sales, but Wall Street's estimates are wide-ranging: Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas anticipates humanoid robots will be a multidecade, trillion-dollar opportunity largely because the adoption curve could accelerate faster than for autonomous cars on public roads. Far more capital will be pumped into the humanoids given the thousands of repetitive and dangerous human tasks that could be made significantly easier with robots being incorporated into factory lines, warehouses and kitchens, Jonas wrote in a September note to clients. "The urgency to scale humanoids is palpable," Morgan Stanley equity strategists Edward Stanley and Matias Ovrum wrote in a recent note. "The number of catalyst events is on the rise, and we expect U.S. workers to begin being substituted from 2030 onwards." Just a few publicly traded companies are looking to meet this need. Many are electric vehicle makers with AI skills. XPeng, Nvidia, Tesla and Xiaomi are at the forefront and could be major long-term beneficiaries, Morgan Stanley and Goldman analysts said. There's also a slew of hot startups. XPeng, a Chinese auto giant, is poised to capture "the next AI megatrend," according to Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao. The company's AI Technology Day in early November gave investors a peek at how far humanoids have come. Its second-generation humanoid robot Iron is integrated into XPeng's factories and stores and uses XPeng's own chips to operate its more than 60 joints and 200 degrees of freedom with technology shared from its AI vehicles, XPeng said. A leader in humanoid robots, XPeng's first-generation PX5 was released in October 2023. After the event, Hsaio reiterated an overweight rating and raised his price target by $6 to $17, which implies more than 33% potential upside from Friday's close. Shares have fallen more than 14% this year, hurt by China's economic growth struggles and concerns that growing EV competition will pressure auto sales. However, Hsiao said XPeng has a strong vehicle pipeline, established smart driving capabilities, and an enriched ecosystem of humanoids and other products, such as its eVTOL multicopter aircraft. "XPeng shares offer superior risk-reward among major EV start-ups," Hsaio wrote in a Nov. 6 note to clients. "To rival increasing tech entrants, XPeng's investment in embodied AI via autonomous driving and humanoids will be continuous." Xiaomi is another Chinese company that's been tackling humanoid robots, Morgan Stanley said. Its shares have rallied roughly 94% year to date. Xiaomi first announced its CyberOne humanoid in 2022, unveiling a robot that it said was capable of perceiving three-dimensional space and recognizing individuals and expressions in its environment. CyberOne also has characteristics of a human friend — as it is able to recognize dozens of classifications of human emotion, the company said at the time of release. "CyberOne is able to detect happiness, and even comfort the user in times of sadness," it said. The Chinese humanoid industry has received substantial government support that's led the country to produce "some of the most advanced humanoids revealed to date," Morgan Stanley's Jonas said. China — the world's largest car manufacturer and biggest car market — is, by far, also the top robot market in the world, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Policymakers have recently been pushing the technology as a way to further industrialize and grow the country's struggling economy, which is also facing a population crisis. China's Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday that local government officials in China have released robotics policies and unveiled a plan, which will run until 2029, promoting the innovation and deployment of humanoid robots. According to Citi, China has accounted for 78% of all robotics patents over the past two decades. Closer to home, Tesla is a big player with the ear of the incoming Trump administration, which could open the door to more support of the emerging industry and accelerate the company's robotics developments to help it compete with rivals in China. Tesla's ambitions in the space have become one of the biggest talking points behind the company's long-term growth forecasts, particularly as it struggles to sustain its domestic EV market share. "While we see some fundamental headwinds to the core auto business over the near to medium term, we also believe the stock could remain at a higher multiple to reflect the long-term opportunity tied to [full-self driving]/robotics given broader market interest in potential AI beneficiaries," Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a Dec. 3 note to clients. Pockets of Wall Street are still deciding how to value Tesla's grandiose robotics visions. The company first revealed its ambitions to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event. However, its Optimus robots, seen folding laundry in a demo video earlier this year, were criticized for being operated by humans using controls, rather than acting autonomously. CEO Elon Musk hasn't been clear on Optimus' capabilities, but claimed in June that its humanoid robots could eventually boost Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion. Tesla's shares have popped about 46% over the past month, largely because of Musk's close ties with Trump. Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu recently reiterated his buy rating on the stock, saying the incoming administration could drive increased support for Tesla's humanoid robotics. "Beyond attributing the price action to tactical factors, we see potential large terminal value benefits to Tesla's efforts in auto, robotaxi, and even humanoid robotics," Yu wrote in a Nov. 12 note. Yu said the Trump administration could back the development of a supply chain that could support the industrialization of humanoid robots, which he said would need to be produced at a large scale and low cost. That could look similar to the federal support given to the semiconductor industry, he said. Trump's expected hard-line immigration policies could also eventually "lead to a smaller pool of cheap labor, thereby favoring more investment in automation," he added. Many are still in wait-and-see territory, meanwhile. RBC's Narayan is waiting to see how Tesla's humanoid robot efforts will be deployed and applied in the real world and has valued humanoid robots at just $5 of his $313 price target on Tesla stock. He remains bullish on Tesla's progress in autonomy, particularly with its robotaxis and full self-driving technology, which account for most of his valuation. "Tesla ... has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. To me, for humanoid robots to be a big contributor to that, it would be on the consumer side. And I currently don't include that just because I don't know what that looks like," Narayan said. Macquarie and Morgan Stanley remain enthusiastic that Tesla, like XPeng, has its own in-house manufacturing plants for its humanoid robots, which could help cut costs. But Morgan Stanley is similarly holding back on attaching the technology to its Tesla price target, as its $500 bull case on the company values its humanoid business at exactly $0. Nvidia is a clear AI play, but investors are keeping an eye on its expansion into robotics, where the chipmaker focuses on providing the brains behind the robot. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers' bull case on Nvidia predicts that the company's Omniverse robotics business could offer additional upside. Several companies racing to make humanoid robots are using Nvidia's Project GR00T model, which was announced in March. Nvidia also announced a supercomputer called Jetson Thor earlier this year for deploying into humanoid robots. GR00T — or Generalist Robot 00 Technology — is a platform for developing humanoid robotics and includes foundation models, data capture and generation pipelines as well as robot simulation tools, Nvidia's Lebaredian told CNBC. The company is working on several GR00T models, including ones for robot motion, whole-body control and multimodal sensing. Lebaredian said XPeng, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics and Skild are among the humanoid robot makers currently developing on Nvidia's robotics platforms. "Humanoid robots are an ideal general-purpose embodiment because the world is built for humans — stairs, tools, shelving, kitchens, and workcells — and more," Lebaredian said. Sentiment around humanoid robotics appears to agree on one thing: Humanoids could make everyday life easier, and therefore more advanced. "What many people really want is help with mundane tasks, such as cleaning, so they can do more thinking, art, and leisure. AI robots can help with this utopian angle," Rob Garlick, Citi Global Insights head of technology and innovation, said in a note to clients this month. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Weekend reading: Merry Christmas everyone
URL: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-merry-christmas-everyone/
Time Published: 2024-12-21T12:57:19Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. I can’t deny the Monevator Christmas party is always a little awkward, but I look forward to it every year. It’s the anonymity that makes it tricky. Not just keeping our identities secret from the waiting staff, but also from each other. Finumus doesn’t want anybody to know who he really is, you see. But when you land your private helicopter in the pub garden it’s a bit of a giveaway. Meanwhile my false beard always gets covered in gravy. Secret Santa adds to the surreal air, but again it’s easy to guess who gave what. Did I really need The Accumulator’s slightly musky Chillbreaker now the cost-of-living crisis is over? And while Squirrel accepted her framed stock certificate of a triple-levered uranium ETF – blatantly from Finumus – with good grace, TA groaned as he unwrapped a copy of One Up On Wall Street. “Every bloody year…” he complained, warding off Peter Lynch’s stock-picking classic with a copy of Tim Hale’s Smart Money – which he carries with him everywhere to shun temptation, like a Holy cross. Lynch’s book flew back through the air at me – it’s not easy to duck when you’re sporting a three-foot long beard – and I packed it away for next year. (Stay hungry, stay frugal!) Then there are the gatecrashers. It’s nice enough when Lars shows his face for old time’s sake. And it’s heartening to see The Greybeard grown fat on his equity income trust dividends after all these years. But is that not Ermine in the corner? Plotting something with a bright-looking fellow on a dusty old Sinclair computer? When the whole of yesteryear’s Team Monevator turns up expecting brandy and mince pies, I’m afraid to say we sneak out the back door and escape via that waiting chopper. Monevator membership revenues are going quite well, but we’re not running another Studio 54 here! Talking of membership, a huge thanks to the many readers who now support this site with a few quid every month. It’s made a big difference. I was reading Ed Zitron this week on how the Internet, media, and just using a computer has been progressively ruined over the past decade, and I thought again that I’d probably have turned off Monevator if enough people hadn’t signed up to support our work. Zitron writes: As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. I know – of course we do some of this ourselves. We show ads to non-members on the website, and I prompt new visitors to sign-up to read us by email. We (sparingly) use affiliate links. And some of this involves the same tracking stuff we’re all exposed to on every other site on the Internet, apart from possibly Wikipedia. I suppose a few people may consider us adding a membership tier to be part of this ‘making everything worse’. Well I don’t. I love the membership tier and the purity of email. Some dwindling number of diehards will never accept that creating digital products and destinations for years on end has to be paid for somehow. But for the rest of us I prefer a model where we directly pay for things. I do it myself with other websites and newsletters. Though I accept the costs add up, and there is a limit. If you are of the grumpier persuasion, you’d probably be surprised at everything I turn down. Paid-for links to crypto, currency exchange, and loan sites. (We never sell links). Well-known companies asking us to create stealthy articles to promote their products. Lucrative guest posts by SEO firms. The long trails of clickbait ads that even old-line newspaper sites have at the end of every article these days. Again, you might say you’re looking at an advert next to these words on our website right now. All I can say is that this is the thin end of a very thick wedge. And I fight to stay at the right end. Zitron’s article turned a bit hyperbolic but I agree with most of it. However where I disagree is his broad brush claim that media sites have done all this ‘enshittification’ for vast growth and profits. In fact they’ve usually made endless compromises and degraded the experience to near-unusable levels either because they are desperate not to go bust or because they already went bust and the new owner is squeezing out whatever juice is left in the brand. The big platforms have sucked all the air and money out of the Internet, and everyone else is left to starve. We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing. But countless others have gone dark, or else it would have been better had they done so. As for independent blogs, maybe 95% of those I’ve linked to in the UK are no longer around. Honestly, I’m sometimes tempted to turn Monevator into a subscription-only newsletter and switch off the lights, too. It’s a better experience for readers and better for us. No more fighting spam each day! But we still get so many emails from new people thanking us for helping them take their first steps in investing, or from older hands for keeping them on the straight and narrow. I’ve collected several hundred of these. That folder is probably the crowning achievement of my working life. Perhaps I should have tried harder to achieve more, I guess, but anyway I’m loathe to turn off the site while we’re making a difference – however much Google is trying to kill us and others off with its endless algorithm changes. So again, if you’re signed up as a Monevator member then thank you! You make it possible for us to continue to keep 99% of the 2,000-plus articles we’ve written free to read. A portion of your subscription covers the 30 minutes or more I spend every day keeping Monevator clear of toxic links, racist and sexist comments, and bit rot. Hopefully you’re enjoying the extra member content too, of course! We’re able to go deeper in the member-only articles, especially with my active ones. And it’s very nice not to worry about search engines with them. Don’t forget you can browse all our Mavens and Moguls posts in their archives. There’s quite a few now! On the opposite tack, a few members have asked me to paywall more content. Really – I was surprised too, but I guess it reflects a desire not to be taken advantage of. Personally I feel we have the right balance with our investing-related content, but there is a chance that I will eventually make the Weekend Reading links a members-only affair. Doing these links is a service to our regular readers. Nobody stumbles across them via search. And Weekend Reading is the reading list I’d love to see each week if I wasn’t creating it myself. It takes eight to ten hours to compile each one (much of which consists of reading and rejecting articles you never see links to) but it is a labour of love. However its roots lie in that better Internet of 20 years ago. Back then we used to do ‘blog carnivals’ where blogs would link to each other to spread their traffic and credibility around. Yet besides one or two honourable exceptions – thank you Simple Living in Somerset and Abnormal Returns – almost nobody links freely now. I’ve included hundreds of links to certain blogs and had at most a couple back to us over two decades. More often zero. I get it’s harder because we’re a British site and we can be kind of nerdy. But we do have some articles that are universally worthy of linking to. Even worse, Google probably penalises us nowadays for doing what used to be the right thing and highlighting the best of the web via these links. It’s so rare to do this now that it’s potentially become an indicator of a spammy link farm. Ho hum. A halfway house would be to keep the Weekend Reading list free but for email subscribers only. So again, subscribe to the free emails if you haven’t. Finally, if you’re a member but you’re not getting the emails you expect to see, then please do drop me a line via a reply to this email (ideally) or via the contact form link top-right (risk of getting stuck in spam.) The system is not perfect, but I can always sort out problems. Ditto if you have log-in issues. (Deleting your cookies usually does the trick). Okay, that’s a lot in the weeds for a busy Christmas weekend. I try not to solicit membership too often but the reality is some people churn away (et tu Maven?) so we have to keep topping up. TLDR: please everyone sign-up as members and then we can stay classy indefinitely. Beyond that, thanks for reading us for another year. With all the competition from cat and dog TikToks and belaboured YouTube videos where someone reads out their Vanguard statement for 20 minutes for 100,000 views, we do not take our audience for granted. Nor, for that matter, the many wonderful readers who add so much value in our comments. If Monevator still has a USP in today’s universally indexing-friendly age, it’s surely in the quality of the discussions that take place beneath so many of our articles.

Look forward to your posting a (ID redacted) selfie from the festive works outing! ;o) Thank you for all your content in 2024 (and previous years). I would not complain if all your content was behind a paywall, however, I know you help people at the start of their investing life and may not have access to your content otherwise. Season’s Greetings, Lee. Thanks again for all your work, time and musings, and the rest of the team. 2024 has been a bit of a naff one on a personal level, but the learnings and information gained via this site have meant the financial impacts of some poor health have been cushioned. Roll on 2025. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year year. Thanks for inviting me to the party, TI! (I didn’t realise until I bit into one that the gold coins weren’t chocolate… But the crackers with stock tips instead of jokes were a nice touch.) Happy Christmas to all – and wishing the site a successful year to come! Yeah, back at you big fella. Thanks to all for all your efforts. See you next year, DV. Happy Christmas and thanks for all you do! Thanks for another great year of education and discussions. Much appreciated and hopefully long may it continue. Thank you for your excellent job. Your help was greatly appreciated during my long years of toil in the NHS to facilitate my escape act and live a life of modest luxury in the Med. Merry Christmas and looking forward to more excellent articles and links in 2025. I must say that the comments are also some of the best I have seen in any website. You have created a great community of experts around this site. Peace and goodwill to the Monevator Massive! Love monevator..long may it continue. Obs thanks for the great articles but I would also like to express my gratitude to the mostly unsung heros that are the comments posters. There are too many great ones to list but many times I’ve read a post that I would like to thank but don’t want to clog up the discussion. Here’s a nod to you all. Thanks, have a good one! And keep them coming Merry Christmas to you and all the contributors to Monevator, including the commentees. I came across this website comment via the dreaded X and thought it might be of interest to you (if this comment doesn’t end up in spam) https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/proxyactivism.html But I thought it kind of describes what your members are doing by our small fee – keeping something we feel is worthwhile going and maybe changing the world for some in a small way. The Monevator community feels special, and I’m happy to form part of it. You made the right pricing choices by creating the lower entry Mavens subscription. If it was for the premium Moguls only I’d never have converted, and would feel bad for not supporting the site. Agree that comments add value to already superb content. After years of reading nowadays perhaps 2/3 of even the nerdier comments make sense to me! Happy holidays! Please keep running this site. It is such a useful resource. I know from personal experience how difficult it is – and have given up myself in my niche interest presence some time ago. Thank you for all the good work! Have a great festive time. Thanks for all the effort and articles to TI and TA. I really think you need better pseudonyms – Batman & Robin, Butch & Sundance or Delboy and Rodney possibly. Also echo the thanks to the other posters who take the time to write thoughtful, constructive and helpful posts in the main. One comment on this week’s links – the Chase 5% offer should read as “including” rather than “plus” as it is 3.5+1.5 for 6 months. I raise a glass to y’all. I really enjoyed Ed’s never forgive them link – I was recently and fairly charged as a mobile refusenik but I ain’t got nothing on Ed. It sounds like I iced my Facebook account in the nick of time earlier this year. To the old ways of intelligent human discourse rather than AI slop 😉 Another hearty thank you from me too. After *counts on fingers* about seven years of religiously logging onto your site a couple of times a week and reading almost every article (I draw the line at the nerdiest posts about bond drawdown strategies…), you’ve just persuaded me to sign up via email. I feel a bit ashamed not even being a Maven, but – and I probably shouldn’t admit this – if you put Weekend Reading behind a paywall, that would probably push me to become a paying member. Thank you, and Merry Christmas. I love coming here. Another big thank you for all the great articles (which must involve a significant amount of research and time I’m sure) and weekend reading items over the year. The comments are great to read too. All make the membership subscription extremely worthwhile. [Existential mini special, re the Garden of Forking Paths, see also comments + links at #41, 42, 44 & 45-48 (Aug 23) on DA here: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-not-a-prayer-for-serenity/ Thank you for all your efforts this year. I too love this site and look forward to my Saturday reading. I subscribe to Pensioncraft and the FT and I would give them up before Monevator! Merry Xmas and best wishes for a successful 2025 I am sure you believe it, as having followed this site since the beginning i have never thought you into trolling, but the statement “We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing.” Is quite incredible, amid even a cursory look at how both responded to the October mass murder and rape of Jewish children and elders. Both weee found to deliberately pivoting against Jewish people. Many, many other examples exist. The Times is but one that is head and shoulders of both. Enjoy the financial info as ever, and have a great Xmas Is anyone going to mention how lucrative 2024 has been? It’s been an annus miraculus. I guess if we do that we’re guaranteed to come a cropper in 2025 Gary, The Times site isn’t free. Might be much better, but it isn’t free. Marry Christmas to TI and TA, long as this site exist. Thank you TI & TA, other contributors and regular commenters. I have only commented a couple of times before, and never in a substantive way to actual financial discussions (I have no particular financial expertise or unique experience to share). However, I am here several times a week and religiously read all the articles and comments, gaining much in the way of entertainment and education on the way. So, I do want to momentarily step out of the shadows to say “Cheers” to you all at the end of another informative, enlightening and thought provoking year. I have followed this site for many years: there is so much great, informative content, you should be proud of what you have achieved. Merry Christmas As Roberto #8 but colder and wetter in Wales.Thankyou. For this tired dad, you are the Sunday Supplement of personal finance email round-ups. I look forward to and devour the content in the same way I used to for old media. Thank you and merry Christmas Thanks for all the effort and time it takes to produce the excellent articles and resources. Merry Xmas all I understand the sentiment of not being taken advantage of but for me supporting a site that I regularly direct people to when teaching them about investing is a way of paying it forward ( i really must look into whether i could leave the day job and do financial coaching full time as its definitely the ‘find something you love enough to do for free and youll never work again’ ). The fact I feel I can afford to is in no small part down to the knowledge gained on this website. Take advantage all you want Thanks @TI and @TA for all your efforts this last year … and a big thanks to folks like @ermine and @AlCam for all their follow-up musings too. Whilst financially it’s been a good year, in all honesty I cannot wait for 2024 to be over. This site has kept me distracted from my cancer treatment (fingers crossed all sorted, now in remission) and it has been a mine of fantastic content and (mostly) great banter. Due to the work of @TA I think I’ll be cooking up a gilt-ladder or two next year – would never have approached doing this before, so thank you very much. Here’s to 2025 … bring it on ! @Rhino #22 > It’s been an annus miraculus. I confess I have made the assumption that this is simply the high recent levels of inflation rattling out, shortening the ruler against which we measure our networth. It was one of the useful points made in Rob Dix’s money book that your market holdings are a store of value outwith government manipulation of the money supply. But hey, not to look a gift horse in the mouth, wherever the uplift came from it’s better than not having it at all. Merry Christmas, and happy winter solstice all! I’m a non subscriber. I love the site. I love Weekend Reading especially. The site feels like one of the few non toxic corners left on the internet. I’m not one of the typical readers though, I don’t think. Not high earner, not high net worth. Every month finances are very tight. Monevator has changed my life for the better, from piles of debt in 2014, to small regular investments these days (I’d probably be homeless without the site given recent health issues, if I’d not changed finances). I’d hate to lose access – certainly to the articles that help people like me most, but also understand that producing such quality should be rewarded. Hopefully in the future I will be able to start to repay what this site has given me, but for now thank you is all I can offer. @ermine – well 2024 was the year I did some ‘inflation adjusted’ calculations (with a helping hand from Al Cam the inflation guru). Let’s just say I wish I hadn’t. . I quickly recoiled and took the blue pill of nominal returns. Think I’ll stay there for mental well being reasons. 2024 also the year I attended a FIRE meetup for first time which was pretty cool. Matching blogs to real people is fascinating after all this time. I think you once met up with liberate dot life, a long since moth balled blog, in the real world. Which made me think an ermine hike to see some historic stones could be a grand day out! @Team M: Seasons Greeting to all at Monevator Towers. Great year in ’24! Long may it continue. P.S. I trust you have all now got over the office Christmas party? @Rhino: No guru – just wanted to understand inflation better and had the time and inclination to do so once I pulled the plug. Re: red pill (vs blue pill), see last para (that begins “Fearing …”) at: https://monevator.com/vanguard-price-rise/#comment-1852375 Merry Christmas / holiday of choice. TI (and TA) thanks for all you do. The subscription is a thanks rather than a particular interest in the extra articles. Without the free content I would never have been able to read so many of your great informative articles and not gone on to subscribe. As you say, it’s a balance and I for one think you do an amazing job at maintaining that balance. @all — Thanks to everyone for such smashing feedback, very generous and great to hear that we’re still mostly hitting the right spot. 🙂 @carl — Understood, and thanks for reading us. We definitely appreciate some people at the start of the journey are watching all the pennies — in fact we support that if things are tight! 🙂 One way we’ve tried to tilt towards this reality is to make the Maven member articles a bit more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared more for those at the other end of the journey, where there’s a bit more cash to spare but also a need for insights into the trickier and arguably less well-covered end of lifecycle… @The Investor First of all, thank you for all the amazingly helpful articles over the years and I wish you and everyone at Monevator a lovely Christmas and New Year! I think the general idea of making Maven member articles more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared for those with more cash to spare, is a pretty smart idea. It would be nice, however for the occassional free article on this area, even if it is primarily only a collection of free resources for less wealthy retirees. Happy 2025! Thank you to all the Monevator team! Another year of tremendously insightful articles and well worth the subscription. Happy Christmas. Ditto, all the supportive comments. It has been 5 years since feeling comfortable with our level of FI and finally pulling the plug on work. After many years of benefiting from all the fabulous articles and associated comments, I have finally and belatedly signed up as a Maven. £30 pa is a small price to pay for this great resource. Not sure I am yet a Mogul! Long may Monevator continue. Thanks to all at the Moneyvator team for the work you do and best wishes. @Rhino #33 Well I’m all for stoney things 😉 I went a blog meetup 12 years ago. In tribute to our host’s ‘I’m Still Standing’ riff I note that very few of those blogs are still standing. Ed Zitron’s article seems pertinent – it was the platforms wot ate all the good things. Plus people have lost the ability to read – it’s all youtube videos and podcasts. Panem et circenses because, y’know, focus is hard. I am still not a digital native, though I accept the STFU old man vibe from the last post. In return for eschewing the hive-mind I have time to think and to look, Thoreau’s a man is rich in what he can afford to leave alone is me. There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me. And absolutely nobody else. Not quite Nagel’s What is it like to be a Bat but further along that line than is useful. The demon inflation makes it hard to see right. I do think anyone looking at a great 2024 does need to ask the question how much of this is real particularly if a lot of your capital was bought a while ago – pre Covid say. They still need to kiss the ground and thank their lucky stars, because although the numbers are wrong the value is largely preserved. But we do need to think of those starting out too. Hopefully they will gain from the crash yet to come when we discover AI isn’t all that, or indeed they will gain from the next 15 year bull run is somebody works out how to use it to add value. @TI I am all for keeping Weekend Reading on the open part of the site, and the deacc emphasis on mavens seems an equitable balance. I don’t feel taken advantage of at all, in the round playing some of the hints easily pay for a mogul subs. Sure, there’s some small print saying don’t do that, but I am old enough and ugly enough to go yeah whatever. So far my error was not to go big enough. A Merry Christmas to all Monevatorites, and be of good cheer because the World can’t end today since it’s already tomorrow in Australia 🙂 It is curious how my and @Gary’s (#21) recollections disagree. None of the media I saw expressed anything but stunned horror to the atrocities of 7 October 2023 – and that would have included both the BBC and Guardian because of their open access. In the weeks and months subsequently several commentators expressed their concern that the Israeli response was disproportionate, and that included people writing for the Guardian and also other papers – though there was rather little on the BBC website which includes little other than news (of course the broadcast discussion programmes will have covered all points of view). The Guardian also gave space to writers expressing support for Israel, though none that I saw that gave any credible justification for the death of 14,000 children as part of any legitimate self-defence. But more importantly, absolutely none used anyone’s Jewish faith as a basis for criticism. At least in the mainstream media I see. @Gary @Jonathan B — Thanks both for sharing your views but there are better venues to debate such a contentious topic I’d suggest, so with both sides represented let’s now please leave it there. Thanks! @ermine – ‘There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly’ ..and therein lies the value of the contribution. Precisely because, rather than despite the fact, you present a perspective not shared by the majority. Sometimes we need the inconvenient lone voice of alternative rather than the comforting cacophony of the status quo. Happy Christmas & thanks as always, Monevator team. Glad to hear others who enjoyed the Ed Zitron piece (but agree that it did veer a bit into ‘old man shouts at cloud’ at times, so I hope it wasn’t just read by people like us as confirmation bias). This & the OG Doctorow piece are so important, I think, we are sleepwalking into it all, and it’s already pretty hideous. It will remain a slight mystery (I think being UK, rather than US, is definitely some of it, & not being as aggressive monetisers) why Monevator isn’t much bigger than it is, & so it’s a shame to have to say that consequently it’s probably the better for that. I suppose I must ask (unless I missed something) *cough* where’s the book. I know many people who say their careers went into another gear once they had a book published. But I also know that writing a book is really hard! And very different from writing shorter online pieces. (I must be in a minority of one who was unimpressed by Morgan Housel’s first book – I adore his blog essays, but didn’t think he managed to convert it successfull into a book format). Happy Christmas again, & here’s to good things in 2025 (for me, a return to form for LTI is high on my list!). Merry Christmas everyone, have a lovely time! As always, thanks for the links TI. 😀 Happy Christmas everyone. I’m so pleased that I found Monevator a few years ago (I can’t quite remember but think it was through the compound interest calculator). I agree that it does seem like one of the more civilised parts of the Internet and I routinely find the comments very intelligent and thought provoking. Thank you @TA and @TI for providing such a useful and informative resource. I look forward to the weekend reading email each and every week. @Alan — I think you’re right re: the Chase account wording, ‘including’ is a bit clearer. I’ve changed it now. Thanks! @Rhino — TA (mostly) and me (a little bit) finished 95% of a book about ten years ago. But for various reasons we couldn’t/didn’t get it to 100%. Now the original text would need revising and it’s all too daunting for what would probably be a labour of love only, realistically. @all — Thanks for the further nice comments — and for the new sign-ups! 🙂 Don’t want to clog this thread up with my thanks but we’re enjoying and appreciating them all. It’s interesting—I initially visited the site for the articles, but it’s the weekend reading that I find absolutely brilliant. As a financial adviser, I value having access to a diverse range of articles and opinions, and this is a standout. The best £8 I spend every month! All the best to everyone here, both content makers and commentators. This site remains one of the few civilised places left on the internet. I’ve been following for years but don’t comment much, if at all, mainly because I can’t match the expertise on show here but also because I don’t read the articles until a few days have passed. This allows the comments to build up to a reasonable level. And as mentioned already, the comments (mostly) really do add to the enjoyment of the site. Merry Christmas! Thanks for all the hard work that you all do to keep this unique site going without lowering the bar. Please KBO into the new year and beyond. Long live the Monevator! @ermine(#41) – ‘I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me’. You are in good company. Bertrand Russell agrees with you: https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/ @Nimbus, couldn’t agree more. A great, civilised site with loads of information and brilliant comments that take the debate to another level. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and all the best for 2025. I’m sure it will be another quiet year…! This particular passage in Russell’s ‘In praise of Idleness’ is unforgettable: ‘When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, “What do the poor want with holidays? they ought to work.” People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion’. Just another voice to add to the Merry Christmas and Thank You chorus. Merry Christmas and thank you for all that you do. I think that Weekend reading is one of the best curations on the Internet. And that the whole Monevator concept represents a hopeful reminder of what the Web can be. Since the subject of Russell has arisen here’s my merry Xmas prezzie to all. It’s a cracker. Ho, ho, ho. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OXtO92x5KA Merry Xmas one and all. May 2025 bring you good fortune. Verdad Persistent Alpha piece reminiscent of FundExpert’s fund momentum approach (as well as macro hedge fund pod shops). CFA Institute series should provoke caution in using the widely circulating comparisons back to 1928 and 1871 for the US markets. That said, UK Dividend Stocks highlight that we’re likely approaching bubble territory regardless of issues with underlying data for metrics. Thanks to the Monevator team and best wishes to all for 2025! And thanks also for the Bertrand Russell links, fascinating stuff. Thanks to all at Team Monevator and all the readers who comment, for entertaining and educating me these past 10 years. Wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a prosperous 2025. Merry Christmas and all the best for 2025, thanks for everything! Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail. You can also subscribe without commenting.

Title: Weekend reading: Merry Christmas everyone

Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. I can’t deny the Monevator Christmas party is always a little awkward, but I look forward to it every year. It’s the anonymity that makes it tricky. Not just keeping our identities secret from the waiting staff, but also from each other. Finumus doesn’t want anybody to know who he really is, you see. But when you land your private helicopter in the pub garden it’s a bit of a giveaway. Meanwhile my false beard always gets covered in gravy. Secret Santa adds to the surreal air, but again it’s easy to guess who gave what. Did I really need The Accumulator’s slightly musky Chillbreaker now the cost-of-living crisis is over? And while Squirrel accepted her framed stock certificate of a triple-levered uranium ETF – blatantly from Finumus – with good grace, TA groaned as he unwrapped a copy of One Up On Wall Street. “Every bloody year…” he complained, warding off Peter Lynch’s stock-picking classic with a copy of Tim Hale’s Smart Money – which he carries with him everywhere to shun temptation, like a Holy cross. Lynch’s book flew back through the air at me – it’s not easy to duck when you’re sporting a three-foot long beard – and I packed it away for next year. (Stay hungry, stay frugal!) Then there are the gatecrashers. It’s nice enough when Lars shows his face for old time’s sake. And it’s heartening to see The Greybeard grown fat on his equity income trust dividends after all these years. But is that not Ermine in the corner? Plotting something with a bright-looking fellow on a dusty old Sinclair computer? When the whole of yesteryear’s Team Monevator turns up expecting brandy and mince pies, I’m afraid to say we sneak out the back door and escape via that waiting chopper. Monevator membership revenues are going quite well, but we’re not running another Studio 54 here! Talking of membership, a huge thanks to the many readers who now support this site with a few quid every month. It’s made a big difference. I was reading Ed Zitron this week on how the Internet, media, and just using a computer has been progressively ruined over the past decade, and I thought again that I’d probably have turned off Monevator if enough people hadn’t signed up to support our work. Zitron writes: As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. I know – of course we do some of this ourselves. We show ads to non-members on the website, and I prompt new visitors to sign-up to read us by email. We (sparingly) use affiliate links. And some of this involves the same tracking stuff we’re all exposed to on every other site on the Internet, apart from possibly Wikipedia. I suppose a few people may consider us adding a membership tier to be part of this ‘making everything worse’. Well I don’t. I love the membership tier and the purity of email. Some dwindling number of diehards will never accept that creating digital products and destinations for years on end has to be paid for somehow. But for the rest of us I prefer a model where we directly pay for things. I do it myself with other websites and newsletters. Though I accept the costs add up, and there is a limit. If you are of the grumpier persuasion, you’d probably be surprised at everything I turn down. Paid-for links to crypto, currency exchange, and loan sites. (We never sell links). Well-known companies asking us to create stealthy articles to promote their products. Lucrative guest posts by SEO firms. The long trails of clickbait ads that even old-line newspaper sites have at the end of every article these days. Again, you might say you’re looking at an advert next to these words on our website right now. All I can say is that this is the thin end of a very thick wedge. And I fight to stay at the right end. Zitron’s article turned a bit hyperbolic but I agree with most of it. However where I disagree is his broad brush claim that media sites have done all this ‘enshittification’ for vast growth and profits. In fact they’ve usually made endless compromises and degraded the experience to near-unusable levels either because they are desperate not to go bust or because they already went bust and the new owner is squeezing out whatever juice is left in the brand. The big platforms have sucked all the air and money out of the Internet, and everyone else is left to starve. We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing. But countless others have gone dark, or else it would have been better had they done so. As for independent blogs, maybe 95% of those I’ve linked to in the UK are no longer around. Honestly, I’m sometimes tempted to turn Monevator into a subscription-only newsletter and switch off the lights, too. It’s a better experience for readers and better for us. No more fighting spam each day! But we still get so many emails from new people thanking us for helping them take their first steps in investing, or from older hands for keeping them on the straight and narrow. I’ve collected several hundred of these. That folder is probably the crowning achievement of my working life. Perhaps I should have tried harder to achieve more, I guess, but anyway I’m loathe to turn off the site while we’re making a difference – however much Google is trying to kill us and others off with its endless algorithm changes. So again, if you’re signed up as a Monevator member then thank you! You make it possible for us to continue to keep 99% of the 2,000-plus articles we’ve written free to read. A portion of your subscription covers the 30 minutes or more I spend every day keeping Monevator clear of toxic links, racist and sexist comments, and bit rot. Hopefully you’re enjoying the extra member content too, of course! We’re able to go deeper in the member-only articles, especially with my active ones. And it’s very nice not to worry about search engines with them. Don’t forget you can browse all our Mavens and Moguls posts in their archives. There’s quite a few now! On the opposite tack, a few members have asked me to paywall more content. Really – I was surprised too, but I guess it reflects a desire not to be taken advantage of. Personally I feel we have the right balance with our investing-related content, but there is a chance that I will eventually make the Weekend Reading links a members-only affair. Doing these links is a service to our regular readers. Nobody stumbles across them via search. And Weekend Reading is the reading list I’d love to see each week if I wasn’t creating it myself. It takes eight to ten hours to compile each one (much of which consists of reading and rejecting articles you never see links to) but it is a labour of love. However its roots lie in that better Internet of 20 years ago. Back then we used to do ‘blog carnivals’ where blogs would link to each other to spread their traffic and credibility around. Yet besides one or two honourable exceptions – thank you Simple Living in Somerset and Abnormal Returns – almost nobody links freely now. I’ve included hundreds of links to certain blogs and had at most a couple back to us over two decades. More often zero. I get it’s harder because we’re a British site and we can be kind of nerdy. But we do have some articles that are universally worthy of linking to. Even worse, Google probably penalises us nowadays for doing what used to be the right thing and highlighting the best of the web via these links. It’s so rare to do this now that it’s potentially become an indicator of a spammy link farm. Ho hum. A halfway house would be to keep the Weekend Reading list free but for email subscribers only. So again, subscribe to the free emails if you haven’t. Finally, if you’re a member but you’re not getting the emails you expect to see, then please do drop me a line via a reply to this email (ideally) or via the contact form link top-right (risk of getting stuck in spam.) The system is not perfect, but I can always sort out problems. Ditto if you have log-in issues. (Deleting your cookies usually does the trick). Okay, that’s a lot in the weeds for a busy Christmas weekend. I try not to solicit membership too often but the reality is some people churn away (et tu Maven?) so we have to keep topping up. TLDR: please everyone sign-up as members and then we can stay classy indefinitely. Beyond that, thanks for reading us for another year. With all the competition from cat and dog TikToks and belaboured YouTube videos where someone reads out their Vanguard statement for 20 minutes for 100,000 views, we do not take our audience for granted. Nor, for that matter, the many wonderful readers who add so much value in our comments. If Monevator still has a USP in today’s universally indexing-friendly age, it’s surely in the quality of the discussions that take place beneath so many of our articles. Right, that’s us almost done for 2024. I’ll have my Moguls missive out for December but otherwise we’re taking a break until the first Saturday of the new year. So cheers, Merry Christmas – and see you in 2025!

Look forward to your posting a (ID redacted) selfie from the festive works outing! ;o) Thank you for all your content in 2024 (and previous years). I would not complain if all your content was behind a paywall, however, I know you help people at the start of their investing life and may not have access to your content otherwise. Season’s Greetings, Lee. Thanks again for all your work, time and musings, and the rest of the team. 2024 has been a bit of a naff one on a personal level, but the learnings and information gained via this site have meant the financial impacts of some poor health have been cushioned. Roll on 2025. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year year. Thanks for inviting me to the party, TI! (I didn’t realise until I bit into one that the gold coins weren’t chocolate… But the crackers with stock tips instead of jokes were a nice touch.) Happy Christmas to all – and wishing the site a successful year to come! Yeah, back at you big fella. Thanks to all for all your efforts. See you next year, DV. Happy Christmas and thanks for all you do! Thanks for another great year of education and discussions. Much appreciated and hopefully long may it continue. Thank you for your excellent job. Your help was greatly appreciated during my long years of toil in the NHS to facilitate my escape act and live a life of modest luxury in the Med. Merry Christmas and looking forward to more excellent articles and links in 2025. I must say that the comments are also some of the best I have seen in any website. You have created a great community of experts around this site. Peace and goodwill to the Monevator Massive! Love monevator..long may it continue. Obs thanks for the great articles but I would also like to express my gratitude to the mostly unsung heros that are the comments posters. There are too many great ones to list but many times I’ve read a post that I would like to thank but don’t want to clog up the discussion. Here’s a nod to you all. Thanks, have a good one! And keep them coming Merry Christmas to you and all the contributors to Monevator, including the commentees. I came across this website comment via the dreaded X and thought it might be of interest to you (if this comment doesn’t end up in spam) https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/proxyactivism.html But I thought it kind of describes what your members are doing by our small fee – keeping something we feel is worthwhile going and maybe changing the world for some in a small way. The Monevator community feels special, and I’m happy to form part of it. You made the right pricing choices by creating the lower entry Mavens subscription. If it was for the premium Moguls only I’d never have converted, and would feel bad for not supporting the site. Agree that comments add value to already superb content. After years of reading nowadays perhaps 2/3 of even the nerdier comments make sense to me! Happy holidays! Please keep running this site. It is such a useful resource. I know from personal experience how difficult it is – and have given up myself in my niche interest presence some time ago. Thank you for all the good work! Have a great festive time. Thanks for all the effort and articles to TI and TA. I really think you need better pseudonyms – Batman & Robin, Butch & Sundance or Delboy and Rodney possibly. Also echo the thanks to the other posters who take the time to write thoughtful, constructive and helpful posts in the main. One comment on this week’s links – the Chase 5% offer should read as “including” rather than “plus” as it is 3.5+1.5 for 6 months. I raise a glass to y’all. I really enjoyed Ed’s never forgive them link – I was recently and fairly charged as a mobile refusenik but I ain’t got nothing on Ed. It sounds like I iced my Facebook account in the nick of time earlier this year. To the old ways of intelligent human discourse rather than AI slop 😉 Another hearty thank you from me too. After *counts on fingers* about seven years of religiously logging onto your site a couple of times a week and reading almost every article (I draw the line at the nerdiest posts about bond drawdown strategies…), you’ve just persuaded me to sign up via email. I feel a bit ashamed not even being a Maven, but – and I probably shouldn’t admit this – if you put Weekend Reading behind a paywall, that would probably push me to become a paying member. Thank you, and Merry Christmas. I love coming here. Another big thank you for all the great articles (which must involve a significant amount of research and time I’m sure) and weekend reading items over the year. The comments are great to read too. All make the membership subscription extremely worthwhile. [Existential mini special, re the Garden of Forking Paths, see also comments + links at #41, 42, 44 & 45-48 (Aug 23) on DA here: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-not-a-prayer-for-serenity/ Thank you for all your efforts this year. I too love this site and look forward to my Saturday reading. I subscribe to Pensioncraft and the FT and I would give them up before Monevator! Merry Xmas and best wishes for a successful 2025 I am sure you believe it, as having followed this site since the beginning i have never thought you into trolling, but the statement “We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing.” Is quite incredible, amid even a cursory look at how both responded to the October mass murder and rape of Jewish children and elders. Both weee found to deliberately pivoting against Jewish people. Many, many other examples exist. The Times is but one that is head and shoulders of both. Enjoy the financial info as ever, and have a great Xmas Is anyone going to mention how lucrative 2024 has been? It’s been an annus miraculus. I guess if we do that we’re guaranteed to come a cropper in 2025 Gary, The Times site isn’t free. Might be much better, but it isn’t free. Marry Christmas to TI and TA, long as this site exist. Thank you TI & TA, other contributors and regular commenters. I have only commented a couple of times before, and never in a substantive way to actual financial discussions (I have no particular financial expertise or unique experience to share). However, I am here several times a week and religiously read all the articles and comments, gaining much in the way of entertainment and education on the way. So, I do want to momentarily step out of the shadows to say “Cheers” to you all at the end of another informative, enlightening and thought provoking year. I have followed this site for many years: there is so much great, informative content, you should be proud of what you have achieved. Merry Christmas As Roberto #8 but colder and wetter in Wales.Thankyou. For this tired dad, you are the Sunday Supplement of personal finance email round-ups. I look forward to and devour the content in the same way I used to for old media. Thank you and merry Christmas Thanks for all the effort and time it takes to produce the excellent articles and resources. Merry Xmas all I understand the sentiment of not being taken advantage of but for me supporting a site that I regularly direct people to when teaching them about investing is a way of paying it forward ( i really must look into whether i could leave the day job and do financial coaching full time as its definitely the ‘find something you love enough to do for free and youll never work again’ ). The fact I feel I can afford to is in no small part down to the knowledge gained on this website. Take advantage all you want Thanks @TI and @TA for all your efforts this last year … and a big thanks to folks like @ermine and @AlCam for all their follow-up musings too. Whilst financially it’s been a good year, in all honesty I cannot wait for 2024 to be over. This site has kept me distracted from my cancer treatment (fingers crossed all sorted, now in remission) and it has been a mine of fantastic content and (mostly) great banter. Due to the work of @TA I think I’ll be cooking up a gilt-ladder or two next year – would never have approached doing this before, so thank you very much. Here’s to 2025 … bring it on ! @Rhino #22 > It’s been an annus miraculus. I confess I have made the assumption that this is simply the high recent levels of inflation rattling out, shortening the ruler against which we measure our networth. It was one of the useful points made in Rob Dix’s money book that your market holdings are a store of value outwith government manipulation of the money supply. But hey, not to look a gift horse in the mouth, wherever the uplift came from it’s better than not having it at all. Merry Christmas, and happy winter solstice all! I’m a non subscriber. I love the site. I love Weekend Reading especially. The site feels like one of the few non toxic corners left on the internet. I’m not one of the typical readers though, I don’t think. Not high earner, not high net worth. Every month finances are very tight. Monevator has changed my life for the better, from piles of debt in 2014, to small regular investments these days (I’d probably be homeless without the site given recent health issues, if I’d not changed finances). I’d hate to lose access – certainly to the articles that help people like me most, but also understand that producing such quality should be rewarded. Hopefully in the future I will be able to start to repay what this site has given me, but for now thank you is all I can offer. @ermine – well 2024 was the year I did some ‘inflation adjusted’ calculations (with a helping hand from Al Cam the inflation guru). Let’s just say I wish I hadn’t. . I quickly recoiled and took the blue pill of nominal returns. Think I’ll stay there for mental well being reasons. 2024 also the year I attended a FIRE meetup for first time which was pretty cool. Matching blogs to real people is fascinating after all this time. I think you once met up with liberate dot life, a long since moth balled blog, in the real world. Which made me think an ermine hike to see some historic stones could be a grand day out! @Team M: Seasons Greeting to all at Monevator Towers. Great year in ’24! Long may it continue. P.S. I trust you have all now got over the office Christmas party? @Rhino: No guru – just wanted to understand inflation better and had the time and inclination to do so once I pulled the plug. Re: red pill (vs blue pill), see last para (that begins “Fearing …”) at: https://monevator.com/vanguard-price-rise/#comment-1852375 Merry Christmas / holiday of choice. TI (and TA) thanks for all you do. The subscription is a thanks rather than a particular interest in the extra articles. Without the free content I would never have been able to read so many of your great informative articles and not gone on to subscribe. As you say, it’s a balance and I for one think you do an amazing job at maintaining that balance. @all — Thanks to everyone for such smashing feedback, very generous and great to hear that we’re still mostly hitting the right spot. 🙂 @carl — Understood, and thanks for reading us. We definitely appreciate some people at the start of the journey are watching all the pennies — in fact we support that if things are tight! 🙂 One way we’ve tried to tilt towards this reality is to make the Maven member articles a bit more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared more for those at the other end of the journey, where there’s a bit more cash to spare but also a need for insights into the trickier and arguably less well-covered end of lifecycle… @The Investor First of all, thank you for all the amazingly helpful articles over the years and I wish you and everyone at Monevator a lovely Christmas and New Year! I think the general idea of making Maven member articles more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared for those with more cash to spare, is a pretty smart idea. It would be nice, however for the occassional free article on this area, even if it is primarily only a collection of free resources for less wealthy retirees. Happy 2025! Thank you to all the Monevator team! Another year of tremendously insightful articles and well worth the subscription. Happy Christmas. Ditto, all the supportive comments. It has been 5 years since feeling comfortable with our level of FI and finally pulling the plug on work. After many years of benefiting from all the fabulous articles and associated comments, I have finally and belatedly signed up as a Maven. £30 pa is a small price to pay for this great resource. Not sure I am yet a Mogul! Long may Monevator continue. Thanks to all at the Moneyvator team for the work you do and best wishes. @Rhino #33 Well I’m all for stoney things 😉 I went a blog meetup 12 years ago. In tribute to our host’s ‘I’m Still Standing’ riff I note that very few of those blogs are still standing. Ed Zitron’s article seems pertinent – it was the platforms wot ate all the good things. Plus people have lost the ability to read – it’s all youtube videos and podcasts. Panem et circenses because, y’know, focus is hard. I am still not a digital native, though I accept the STFU old man vibe from the last post. In return for eschewing the hive-mind I have time to think and to look, Thoreau’s a man is rich in what he can afford to leave alone is me. There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me. And absolutely nobody else. Not quite Nagel’s What is it like to be a Bat but further along that line than is useful. The demon inflation makes it hard to see right. I do think anyone looking at a great 2024 does need to ask the question how much of this is real particularly if a lot of your capital was bought a while ago – pre Covid say. They still need to kiss the ground and thank their lucky stars, because although the numbers are wrong the value is largely preserved. But we do need to think of those starting out too. Hopefully they will gain from the crash yet to come when we discover AI isn’t all that, or indeed they will gain from the next 15 year bull run is somebody works out how to use it to add value. @TI I am all for keeping Weekend Reading on the open part of the site, and the deacc emphasis on mavens seems an equitable balance. I don’t feel taken advantage of at all, in the round playing some of the hints easily pay for a mogul subs. Sure, there’s some small print saying don’t do that, but I am old enough and ugly enough to go yeah whatever. So far my error was not to go big enough. A Merry Christmas to all Monevatorites, and be of good cheer because the World can’t end today since it’s already tomorrow in Australia 🙂 It is curious how my and @Gary’s (#21) recollections disagree. None of the media I saw expressed anything but stunned horror to the atrocities of 7 October 2023 – and that would have included both the BBC and Guardian because of their open access. In the weeks and months subsequently several commentators expressed their concern that the Israeli response was disproportionate, and that included people writing for the Guardian and also other papers – though there was rather little on the BBC website which includes little other than news (of course the broadcast discussion programmes will have covered all points of view). The Guardian also gave space to writers expressing support for Israel, though none that I saw that gave any credible justification for the death of 14,000 children as part of any legitimate self-defence. But more importantly, absolutely none used anyone’s Jewish faith as a basis for criticism. At least in the mainstream media I see. @Gary @Jonathan B — Thanks both for sharing your views but there are better venues to debate such a contentious topic I’d suggest, so with both sides represented let’s now please leave it there. Thanks! @ermine – ‘There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly’ ..and therein lies the value of the contribution. Precisely because, rather than despite the fact, you present a perspective not shared by the majority. Sometimes we need the inconvenient lone voice of alternative rather than the comforting cacophony of the status quo. Happy Christmas & thanks as always, Monevator team. Glad to hear others who enjoyed the Ed Zitron piece (but agree that it did veer a bit into ‘old man shouts at cloud’ at times, so I hope it wasn’t just read by people like us as confirmation bias). This & the OG Doctorow piece are so important, I think, we are sleepwalking into it all, and it’s already pretty hideous. It will remain a slight mystery (I think being UK, rather than US, is definitely some of it, & not being as aggressive monetisers) why Monevator isn’t much bigger than it is, & so it’s a shame to have to say that consequently it’s probably the better for that. I suppose I must ask (unless I missed something) *cough* where’s the book. I know many people who say their careers went into another gear once they had a book published. But I also know that writing a book is really hard! And very different from writing shorter online pieces. (I must be in a minority of one who was unimpressed by Morgan Housel’s first book – I adore his blog essays, but didn’t think he managed to convert it successfull into a book format). Happy Christmas again, & here’s to good things in 2025 (for me, a return to form for LTI is high on my list!). Merry Christmas everyone, have a lovely time! As always, thanks for the links TI. 😀 Happy Christmas everyone. I’m so pleased that I found Monevator a few years ago (I can’t quite remember but think it was through the compound interest calculator). I agree that it does seem like one of the more civilised parts of the Internet and I routinely find the comments very intelligent and thought provoking. Thank you @TA and @TI for providing such a useful and informative resource. I look forward to the weekend reading email each and every week. @Alan — I think you’re right re: the Chase account wording, ‘including’ is a bit clearer. I’ve changed it now. Thanks! @Rhino — TA (mostly) and me (a little bit) finished 95% of a book about ten years ago. But for various reasons we couldn’t/didn’t get it to 100%. Now the original text would need revising and it’s all too daunting for what would probably be a labour of love only, realistically. @all — Thanks for the further nice comments — and for the new sign-ups! 🙂 Don’t want to clog this thread up with my thanks but we’re enjoying and appreciating them all. It’s interesting—I initially visited the site for the articles, but it’s the weekend reading that I find absolutely brilliant. As a financial adviser, I value having access to a diverse range of articles and opinions, and this is a standout. The best £8 I spend every month! All the best to everyone here, both content makers and commentators. This site remains one of the few civilised places left on the internet. I’ve been following for years but don’t comment much, if at all, mainly because I can’t match the expertise on show here but also because I don’t read the articles until a few days have passed. This allows the comments to build up to a reasonable level. And as mentioned already, the comments (mostly) really do add to the enjoyment of the site. Merry Christmas! Thanks for all the hard work that you all do to keep this unique site going without lowering the bar. Please KBO into the new year and beyond. Long live the Monevator! @ermine(#41) – ‘I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me’. You are in good company. Bertrand Russell agrees with you: https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/ @Nimbus, couldn’t agree more. A great, civilised site with loads of information and brilliant comments that take the debate to another level. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and all the best for 2025. I’m sure it will be another quiet year…! This particular passage in Russell’s ‘In praise of Idleness’ is unforgettable: ‘When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, “What do the poor want with holidays? they ought to work.” People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion’. Just another voice to add to the Merry Christmas and Thank You chorus. Merry Christmas and thank you for all that you do. I think that Weekend reading is one of the best curations on the Internet. And that the whole Monevator concept represents a hopeful reminder of what the Web can be. Since the subject of Russell has arisen here’s my merry Xmas prezzie to all. It’s a cracker. Ho, ho, ho. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OXtO92x5KA Merry Xmas one and all. May 2025 bring you good fortune. Verdad Persistent Alpha piece reminiscent of FundExpert’s fund momentum approach (as well as macro hedge fund pod shops). CFA Institute series should provoke caution in using the widely circulating comparisons back to 1928 and 1871 for the US markets. That said, UK Dividend Stocks highlight that we’re likely approaching bubble territory regardless of issues with underlying data for metrics. Thanks to the Monevator team and best wishes to all for 2025! And thanks also for the Bertrand Russell links, fascinating stuff. Thanks to all at Team Monevator and all the readers who comment, for entertaining and educating me these past 10 years. Wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a prosperous 2025. Merry Christmas and all the best for 2025, thanks for everything! Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail. You can also subscribe without commenting.

Title: SEC Greenlights First Hybrid Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs From Franklin Templeton, Hashdex
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/sec-greenlights-first-hybrid-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-from-franklin-templeton-hashdex/
Time Published: 2024-12-21T12:30:02Z
Full Content:
Amid yesterday’s crypto market slump, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first-ever dual Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Franklin Templeton and Hashdex. The ETFs are scheduled for launch in January 2025. For the first time, the US financial regulator has approved hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum index ETFs. Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will trade on Nasdaq, while Franklin Templeton’s Crypto Index ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Both ETFs will hold spot BTC and ETH in proportions reflecting their respective market capitalizations, currently resulting in an 80:20 ratio favoring Bitcoin. However, the ETFs may expand to include other cryptocurrencies in the future, pending regulatory approval. The SEC highlighted that Franklin Templeton’s December 18 filing received expedited approval. Commenting on the development, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said: Will be interesting to see if BlackRock or others attempt to piggyback on this and launch similar ETFs. Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors love diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto. Geraci emphasized the potential rationale behind the SEC’s decision to approve the crypto index ETFs, pointing to their similarities with the previously approved spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETFs in terms of the trusts’ structure and the operation terms. The SEC added that proposals for both the ETFs aligned with the criteria set forth by the Exchange Act. For the uninitiated, the Exchange Act requires issuers to implement safeguards against fraud, manipulation, and risks to investors. Asset manager Hashdex first amended its S-1 filing with the SEC in October, and submitted a second amended application on November 25. Franklin Templeton filed its S-1 for the crypto index ETF in August. In Hashdex’s November filing, the company stated that other digital assets, such as Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), and Litecoin (LTC), may meet its eligibility criteria and could be added to the ETF in the future with regulatory approval. Franklin Templeton’s ETF also leaves room to add other cryptocurrencies, but did not specify any by name. Notably, Hashdex’s ETF will rely on custodial services from Coinbase, BitGo, Fidelity, and Gemini. Similarly, Franklin Templeton’s ETF will use BitGo and Coinbase as its primary custodians. The crypto ETF space is becoming increasingly competitive, thanks to their resounding success since their launch earlier this year. Experts opine that US-based crypto spot ETFs may soon overtake spot gold ETFs in terms of net assets held. Following the US, other countries in the world are also steadily warming up to the idea of regulated crypto ETFs. At press time, BTC trades at $95,824, down 4.8% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Governments and banks once mocked Bitcoin. Now they want in on it

After topping $100,000, Bitcoin supporters see the cryptocurrency soaring even higher. Bitcoin has proven to be one of the best-performing assets in modern history. The value of the cryptocurrency has increased some 1,000 times over the past decade, far outpacing US stocks and real estate. Buoyed by United States President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, Bitcoin’s record rally hit a new high of $107,000 on Monday after the Republican reiterated his intention to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Bitcoin, the first decentralised digital currency, was invented by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Nakamoto introduced the blockchain system – a digital ledger that stores transactions in a network of computers – to enable anyone to make financial transactions without the involvement of banks, financial firms or governments. Once widely derided as a speculative asset with no intrinsic value, Bitcoin is being taken increasingly seriously by governments, financial institutions and investors alike. Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech analyst, said Bitcoin has transformed from being a niche asset favoured by political dissidents and criminals carrying out Illicit transactions “to something that central banks have to keep in mind and consider”. “The IMF has put very firm anti-crypto political guidelines into place when negotiating with countries that might require its own assistance. It’s gone from being an academic question to a practical, real one and one that central banks are taking very seriously now,” Sobrado told Al Jazeera. In January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds), allowing investors to have exposure to the asset on the stock exchange for the first time. In an October report, the US Department of the Treasury referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold”, noting its use as a store of value. A number of countries have made big bets on the cryptocurrency. El Salvador has accumulated some $600m worth of Bitcoin reserves and is one of just a handful of countries, along with the Central African Republic, that accepts the asset as legal tender. Other countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, have acquired large holdings of Bitcoin through the seizure of assets implicated in criminal activity. The US has seized at least 215,000 Bitcoins, valued at almost $21bn at current prices, since 2020, according to an analysis by crypto firm 21.co. With Trump returning to the White House, Bitcoin supporters are hopeful that cryptocurrencies will gain unprecedented legitimacy after years of government-led crackdowns on the sector. Despite once labelling Bitcoin “a scam”, Trump has emerged as arguably the world’s most powerful advocate for the asset. After pledging to make the US “crypto capital of the planet”, he has picked several high-profile crypto enthusiasts to join his incoming administration, including former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as crypto tsar and Paul Atkins as SEC chair. Trump’s pro-crypto stance has found allies in the US Congress, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming, who earlier this year introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2024, which would include Bitcoin among reserve assets such as gold and oil as a long-term store of value. Under Lummis’s plans, the government would buy roughly 200,000 Bitcoins every year for five years, and then hold the assets for 20 years as a hedge against inflation. “If we did that with five percent of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist – which is roughly a million Bitcoin – we could cut our debt in half in 20 years,” Lummis said in a television interview with Fox Business. On Wall Street, derision and mockery have also given way to more positive appraisals. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who once described Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering”, in January said the commodity was “no different than what gold represented for thousands of years” and an “asset class that protects you”. The key attribute of Bitcoin that makes it revolutionary is that it separates money from the state, according to Max Keiser, senior Bitcoin adviser to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. “This is the first time in history that this has ever happened – money exists that has no central authority controlling it. This is what makes it unique, very powerful,” Keiser told Al Jazeera. “There’s now this growing feeling that the 21st century will be the century of Bitcoin.” Keiser spotted Bitcoin’s potential early on and advised people to buy it when its value was only $1 in 2011. That year, he and his wife, television presenter Stacy Herbert, called Bitcoin “the currency of resistance”, and predicted it would top $100,000. One of the reasons Bitcoin has gained strength in value is the poor performance of economies such as Argentina, where inflation last year skyrocketed more than 200 percent, according to Gerald Celente, founder and director of the New York-based Trends Research Institute. “People were seeing their currencies being devalued… People were saying: ‘I’m losing all my money, what am I going to do?’ They can’t afford to buy gold, so they started buying whatever they could in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, so that kept it strong,” Celente told Al Jazeera. Since Trump’s election, Bitcoin’s price has risen by more than 50 percent and with an incoming pro-crypto administration, Celente predicts an even greater rally. “[The value] could go through the roof, but we don’t see [Bitcoin] going down much at all,” he said. Crypto supporters argue that Bitcoin’s winning advantage is that its global supply is capped at 21 million. Unlike central banks that can print money indefinitely, Bitcoin’s supply stays constant no matter the demand, which has helped boost its value against the dollar. Armando Pantoja, futurist and tech investor, believes that Bitcoin will appreciate in value “forever”, likening the purchase of the asset to buying real estate in Manhattan. “Bitcoin has value not because of the currency, but because of the technology that governs it, blockchain technology,” Pantoja told Al Jazeera. “In Bitcoin’s blockchain, there’s a certain supply of Bitcoin that comes out every 10 minutes, and every four years they cut it in half. Over time there is less and less Bitcoin being generated. “Once it reaches the limit, no more can be created… That’s why it’s going to keep going up, every four years when they cut the supply, it has to respond positively. It has to keep going up to supply the demand.” Keiser predicts Bitcoin will reach $1m in value in the coming years, with a market cap at least equal to gold’s market cap of $20 trillion. “That would be $1m a coin. I think that would be a conservative estimate for the price for the next three to four years,” he said. Bitcoin’s stellar rise, however, has not convinced everyone. Despite its recent rally, the commodity continues to be extremely volatile. After hitting $107,000 at the start of the week, the asset had by Friday plunged below $97,000. Many financial analysts continue to view Bitcoin as a bubble with little to support its stunning rise. “The more resources Americans misallocate to #Bitcoin and #crypto-related businesses, the fewer resources will be available to devote to making stuff we actually need,” Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, said in a post on X last month. “The end result will be larger trade deficits, a weaker dollar, higher inflation, and a lower standard of living.” Even as Trump’s positive stance towards Bitcoin has thrilled crypto enthusiasts, some pro-crypto governments have reined in their support of the sector. El Salvador announced this week that it would privatize or close its cryptocurrency wallet “Chivo” as part of the terms of a $1.4bn loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Bukele’s government also agreed to make acceptance of Bitcoin by businesses voluntary, within steps to assuage the IMF’s concerns about Bitcoin-related risks. Some crypto supporters see governments and central banks taking a leading role in the global march towards digitised money with the development of their own currencies. Celente of the Trends Research Institute said the US, for example, could create its own digital currency as a way to pay off its federal debt. “There’s no way the US can pay off their $36 trillion worth of government debt. They may come up with a new cryptocurrency as part of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currency),” Celente said. “You’re seeing more and more of the central banks talking about CBDCs, they’re definitely going to go into that direction,” Celente added. “They’re going to use this as an excuse to come up with a coin because they cannot pay off the debt that they have now. They’re going to say, ‘This [digital currency] is worth a lot more than the dollar, yuan, the euro,’ and use that to pay off their debt.” Some observers have warned that the introduction of CBDCs would open a Pandora’s box of problems related to government control and surveillance of people’s finances. Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, which manages the stockpile of US Treasuries that back Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a traditional commodity or currency to maintain a stable price. They have reached record volumes of more than $200bn in total market cap. Sobrado said there could be an opening for Tether to become the national de facto privatised CBDC for the US, and for smaller economies such as the UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland to issue their own CBDCs. “The pro-crypto voices and Fed-critical voices have never been louder in the White House,” Sobrado said. Celente said he had no doubt that the future of money is digital. “There’s no question at all,” he affirmed. Follow Al Jazeera English:

The transaction is expected to close by the middle of next year, and have an impact of 25 basis points on BNP Paribas’ CET1 ratio, the French lender said in a statement Saturday, confirming its previous guidance. The deal will create one of Europe’s largest money managers, with roughly €1.5 trillion in assets overseen. A good chunk will be in popular and usually more lucrative markets such as private credit, infrastructure and real estate, where Axa adds more than €200 billion. Prior to the purchase, the BNP CEO had shied away from big takeovers, deciding instead to return excess cash to shareholders after selling US lender Bank of the West for $16.3 billion last year. The Axa deal will allow BNP to challenge Europe’s No. 1 in asset management, Amundi SA, although it would still be dwarfed by US firms such as BlackRock Inc. or Vanguard Group Inc. Axa has said it plans to use proceeds from the sale for share buybacks and to fund growth.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Sure That The Broad Demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Products Isn’t Going Anywhere

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 76 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a multimedia and entertainment giant and a household name. The shifting winds in the media industry created by the rise of streaming services have created trouble for the firm in 2024. By mid-November, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s stock was up by a modest 13% year-to-date as it battled an 8% revenue and 22% operating income drop in Q1. However, since mid-November's Q3 report, the shares have gained 8.42%. During Q3, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s streaming operating profit sat at $322 million and an overall profit of $47 million. The overall profit was the first in history, and Cramer thinks a turnaround is in sight: "You know that I have turned positive on Disney. Hugh Johnson, CFO is helping too. Well Morgan Stanley, I think they agree with me. Now they take a, they really have a top pick situation, and they ask Spotify, which by the way they raised the price target, Spotify is a great subscription model. But they did swap it for Disney, David, substantial streaming profits coming, password crackdowns, and best of all, they are now part of the distribution is king metaphor.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is the healthcare benefits manager facing significant stock price storms in December. Over the past month, the firm's shares have lost 21.5%. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)'s share price performance is driven by growing government and public sentiment against benefits providers as well as President-elect Trump's intent to take on the healthcare middlemen. The shifting winds have come amidst a turnaround effort through which CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is purportedly looking to spin-off businesses such as its Medicare Advantage division. To boot, the Justice Department has also accused the firm of filing illegal opioid prescriptions, and similar accusations in the past have cost CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) as much as $5 billion in resolution. According to Cramer: "CVS is a real company. And the stock broke down, I saw someone on Frank Holland's show this morning talk about a potential bottoming in some of these. Look, the President-elect does not say it once. He says it like ten times. That he wants to wipe out middleman. I mean it's a theme."

Title: A risky corner of the ETF market has boomed this year as YOLO traders chase the rally
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/leveraged-etf-single-stock-etfs-nvidia-microstrategy-nvdl-traders-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-21T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
While the stock market was an early frontier of the gambling craze that gripped America in 2024, investors have driven a boom in a relatively new kind of investment product that can amplify gains — and losses — in a single name. Enter leveraged single-stock exchange-traded funds. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, ETFs have been groundbreaking in offering the characteristics of a mutual fund — owning a basket of diversified stocks — but offering the daily trading liquidity of a single stock. But even after 30 years, the humble ETF is seeing fresh updates that cater to investors with a strong appetite for risk. Instead of owning a basket of stocks, single-stock ETFs track the price of one stock, which the fund will try to juice returns on by levering up. "These are vehicles that mass retail has never had the ability to trade before, until now," Todd Sohn, an ETF specialist at Strategas told Business Insider. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF seeks to deliver double the move of Nvidia's daily price fluctuations. On Friday, Nvidia stock jumped about 2.5% amid a broader market rebound, while shares of the 2x Nvidia ETF returned nearly 5%. Year-to-date, the 2x Nvidia ETF is up 346%, compared to a 170% gain for the stock. "Traders are looking to implement high-conviction ideas through them," Sohn said. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into these funds, making for some highly successful ETF launches in recent months. That 2x Nvidia ETF has attracted more than $5 billion in assets, while other popular leveraged ETFs tracking stocks like MicroStrategy and Coinbase have each attracted well over $1 billion in assets. That's a big deal for the ETF space, where the breakeven point for most ETF products is around $50 million in assets, according to white-label ETF provider Alpha Architect. Year-to-date, more than 60 ETFs have launched catering to single-stocks, attracting a combined $23 billion in assets, according to data provided by Sohn. While that amounts to relative peanuts in the $10 trillion universe of ETFs, it's still notable, and the funds are seeing a lot of use. "They do pop up quite often on the most traded ETFs list," Sohn said, adding that ETFs linked to Nvidia, Tesla, Coinbase, and MicroStrategy are the most popular. But while they can deliver outsize returns, these investment vehicles are inherently risky, much more so than owning the underlying stock. Sohn said that leveraged ETFs are incredibly volatile, and due to options decay, they're best used as a trading vehicle, "not a set it and forget it vehicle," Sohn said. Options decay refers to the idea that, even if the underlying stock trades sideways, the leveraged ETFs would likely move lower as options expire with zero value and new contracts are purchased. And the leveraged downside tied to these ETFs can be painful. During Nvidia's summer correction, the 2x long Nvidia ETF lost about 63%, prompting concern from Redditors who invested. "Now I've lost a ton on NVDL (not touching my NVDA) and I am trying to think what makes the most sense," a Redditor said in a post on the Nvidia subreddit earlier this year. Another example is MicroStrategy stock, which is down about 33% from its late November peak, while the 2x ETF that tracks the stock is down more than 60% over the same period. The trading craze recalls another popular recent high-risk investment trend—the zero-day option. The contracts are a bet on the single-day move in a stock, with the option expiring the same day a trader buys it. The market took off during the pandemic trading boom, and it got so big that JPMorgan warned last year that its popularity could spark bouts of volatility in the broader market. But for now, the risks appear to be limited to the individual traders who are buying them and not the broader market. "While single-stock leveraged ETFs have gained in popularity this year, they remain relatively small in size. For example, NVDL has $5.5 billion in assets and NVIDIA is a $3 trillion stock," Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at TMX VettaFi, told Business Insider. Going forward, risk-on traders seem less concerned about the risks associated with the single-stock ETFs and more focused on which one will take off next. "The next questions is… what name catches on next with the trading crowd? Palantir seems to be one candidate (and has 2x ETFs out there). But we'll see what else comes up," Sohn said.

December 20, 2024 18:00 ET | Source: Purpose Investments Inc. Purpose Investments Inc. TORONTO, Dec. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Purpose Investments Inc. (“Purpose”) today announced the final annual distributions of income and capital gains for its open-end exchange-traded funds structured as mutual fund trusts (the “Funds”) with a December 15, 2024 tax year-end. The distributions represent income earned and capital gains realized by the Funds during the year. Details of the per unit distribution amounts are as follows: Final Annual Distributions of Income ETF Series unitholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2024 will receive the 2024 annual income distributions on January 7, 2025. The ex-distribution date for the 2024 annual income distributions will be December 31, 2024. Purpose expects to announce the final year-end notional distribution of income for Purpose Specialty Lending Trust on or about January 24, 2025, if necessary. Final Annual Capital Gains – Notional Distributions The annual capital gains distributions for the funds listed in table above will be paid as notional distributions. With a notional distribution, the units issued from the distribution are immediately consolidated with the units held prior to the distribution. The number of units held after the distribution is therefore identical to the number of units held before the distribution. Purpose confirms that the notional capital gain distributions will be applied to ETF holders of record as at the close of business on December 23, 2024. The ex-distribution date for the notional capital gain distributions will be December 23, 2024. Final Annual Capital Gains – Cash Distributions The respective unitholders of record on December 31, 2024 for the funds listed in the table above will receive the 2024 annual cash distributions on January 7, 2025. The ex-dividend date for the 2024 annual distributions for these ETFs (Purpose Active Balanced Fund – ETF Units, Purpose Active Growth Fund – ETF Units, and Purpose Active Conservative Fund – ETF Units) will be December 31, 2024. The actual breakdown of taxable amounts of reinvested and cash distributions for 2024 tax year, including tax factor allocations, will be reported to the brokers through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. in early 2025. As an update to the press release issued on November 27, 2024, Purpose confirms that Apple (AAPL) Yield Shares Purpose ETF, Amazon (AMZN) Yield Shares Purpose ETF, NVIDIA (NVDA) Yield Shares Purpose ETF, and Microsoft (MSFT) Yield Shares Purpose ETF will not declare a special annual distribution in 2024. Purpose expects to announce the final year-end distributions for Purpose High Interest Savings Fund – ETF Units, Purpose US Cash Fund – ETF Units, Purpose Cash Management Fund – ETF Units, and Purpose USD Cash Management Fund – ETF Units on or about December 31, 2024, if necessary. Purpose expects to announce the final annual capital gain distributions for Purpose Fund Corp. and Big Banc Split Corp. on or about January 24, 2025, if necessary. Shareholders of record on January 30, 2025 will receive the annual capital gains distributions on February 5, 2025, and such capital gains will be applicable for the 2025 tax year. The final year-end capital gains distributions for these funds will be paid in cash. Purpose confirms that Purpose Mutual Funds Limited funds will not declare annual capital gain distributions for the 2024 tax year.

Title: The Best Places To Buy Contacts Online, According To A Lens-Wearer
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-place-to-buy-contacts-online/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T20:53:24Z
Full Content:
As a contact lens-wearer for nearly two decades, I’ve learned that purchasing contacts online is both cheaper and more convenient than buying them at the optometrist’s office. Having purchased from 1-800 Contacts for a number of years, I named this retailer the best place to buy contacts online due to its incredible return policy (return any unused contacts, any time), Best Price Guarantee and friendly, accessible customer service. But, there are other contacts e-tailers deserving of accolades for their own reasons, like Hubble, my choice for a subscription-based service, and Warby Parker, ideal for lens-wearers who also d0n the company’s stylish frames. I consider 1-800 Contacts to be the best place to buy contacts overall thanks to its variety, Best ... [+] Price Guarantee and ridiculously generous return policy. When making a contacts purchase online, you’ll need a current prescription at the ready. Most sites let you upload a scan of your prescription then plug in your eye doctor information to be verified. While you cannot use an expired prescription to make a purchase as per the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—and prescriptions are only good for one or two years, but it varies by state—many sites offer virtual exams for prescription renewals. Some of my favorite places to order contacts online offer this option, but I also evaluated e-tailers for variety, pricing, shipping and return policies, and whether they accept insurance and HSA or FSA funds. Below, see my top picks and how they fit your contacts-buying needs. 1-800 Contacts Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited and one-day options | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges any time, including opened boxes | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts FSA and HSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: I’ve remained a 1-800-contacts customer for years because, second to purchasing from a reputable site, my priority is price. The company’s Best Price Guarantee offers assurance that you’ll score your lenses for the lowest market price; just contact customer service via the 24/7 live chat and show them a link to the same lower-priced product for verification. The process is relatively easy, save for a few qualifying factors—for instance, the competitor must be U.S.-based, and searching for an eligible price match can get time-consuming. (I explain more thoroughly in my full 1-800-Contacts review if you want to know more). So, if you want the lowest cost for your lenses up front without doing any legwork, this may not be the best retailer for you. Other features that earn the company top marks include its ExpressExam, a virtual prescription renewal that costs $20, its fast free shipping and its generous return policy: You can return unused contacts at any time (somehow, I always have more dailies left for my right eye…)—even if you purchased them from another retailer. And, if you need specs, you can shop frames from its house brand, Liingo. Ultimately, 1-800-Contacts has earned its reputation for stellar and accessible customer service, and in my experience, I’ve always found its reps to be accommodating, helpful and incredibly friendly. Hubble Shipping: $4 standard shipping (plus any applicable sales tax) | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 14 days for a refund, less shipping and handling | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes, free for subscribers What you’ll love: Keep in mind: It’s no secret that contact lenses are expensive, and Hubble’s monthly subscription model helps lessen up-front costs while keeping you stocked up. If you’re not stuck on a brand and want the most bang for your buck, check out Hubble’s line of lenses, which range from $23 to $30 per month, per eye. They include Hubble, the namesake line that features affordable dailies; Hydro for extra dry eyes; and SkyHy, the most breathable option. If you’re considering switching brands, though, the FTC states you may need a new prescription unless it’s “a generic or store brand version of the same lens” recommended by your doc. Hubble also has offerings from Acuvue, Bausch + Lomb and Biotrue, but that’s the extent of its third-party offerings. For hesitant first-timer subscribers, the e-tailer’s initial promos are hard to beat, starting as low as $1 per eye for the Hubble Classic Daily 10-day starter pack—shipping included. Another boon is its virtual vision tests for prescription renewals, which is free for subscribers. While many well-known online contacts lens retailers offer auto-ship or subscription options, Hubble’s biggest defining factor is its overall cost friendliness, if you don’t mind the lack of brand variety. Just keep in mind that each order costs $4 in shipping, plus any additional taxes, if applicable. GlassesUSA Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited and express options | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges of unopened boxes within 60 days | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts FSA and HSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: As far as variety and a straightforward user experience, GlassesUSA is a well-known eyewear retailer and one-stop shop for glasses, sunglasses and of course, contact lenses. Further, it offers a multitude of options in each category. When shopping for contacts, you can easily search by brand, lens type, prescription type (single-vision, multifocal, astigmatism, etc.), budget and more, and there’s an Auto-Refill option at checkout. The company also accepts insurance, and while its Price Match Guarantee isn’t as outwardly advertised as others, it will honor lower competitor pricing (and reimburse you the difference if it’s within three days of your purchase). One thing the site lacks, though, is a virtual prescription renewal feature. This is a great place to shop if you’re big into browsing sales and coupons; the site is transparent with discounts and has an easy-to-find sale section and coupon page. And because GlassesUSA specializes in, well, glasses, you can take advantage of promotions across different types of eyewear, like free glasses worth up to $150 with your first shipment of contacts. Contacts Direct Shipping: Free standard shipping and store pickup at LensCrafters, plus priority and express options | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 6 months for a refund, less shipping charges | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: While many other contact lens retailers accept insurance, and more frequently HSA and FSA funds, ContactsDirect makes cashing in on these benefits especially easy. The company’s insurance policy page outlines accepted carriers as well as info on out-of-network vision plans, and you can speak with customer service reps via live chat or phone if you need help or have questions. Plus, savings is not exclusive to insurance holders: Visit its savings page for info on promos, including 15% off all orders with code MYCONTACTS plus a standard 15% off for military members, teachers, government workers, first responders, and hospital and medical workers. ContactsDirect also does price matching, but only with a select list of competitors (including Walgreens and Costco). Selection-wise, this site offers all the major brands and varieties, including specialty lenses like multifocals or those for astigmatism. You can also get your prescription renewed online for $19—which is $10 off—with code VISION10. Contact Lens King Shipping: $10 to $13 for standard US shipping, plus priority and expedited options | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 30 days for a refund, less shipping charges | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Before you get too excited about Contact Lens King’s low pricing, it’s important to note that shipping is quite steep at $10 to $13 for standard domestic shipping. So if you’re only ordering, say, two to four boxes of lenses and break down the cost, you’re probably not be saving much. (Yes, I’ve done that math.) However, if you typically order a larger supply of six-plus boxes, the savings adds up. And while you may see lower cost-per-box options on other sites, beware of excessive hidden fees that are tacked on in cart. Otherwise, Contact Lens King offers a pretty standard experience when it comes to shopping for contacts online, including ample brand and lens variety (with options for astigmatism and colored contacts), the acceptance of HSA and FSA funds (but not insurance) and accessible help via phone or live chat. You won’t find extra features like virtual prescription renewals here, but you will find transparent pricing that will save you cash if you buy in bulk. Warby Parker Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited option | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges of unopened boxes within 60 days of receipt| Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Warby Parker’s claim to fame is its affordable line of stylish frames that start at $95. It’s also known for its Home Try-On program that lets you test five pairs for free before making your purchase. Now, it also offers a large selection of contact lenses including its value house brand called Scout, which you can sample at no cost. While the company offers convenient and cost-saving perks like competitive pricing, free shipping and virtual prescription renewals, and it accepts insurance, HSA and FSA funds, these incentives aren’t necessarily unique. But for fans of Warby Parker’s frames—especially frequent buyers, or those who alternate regularly between glasses and lenses—you can get all your eyewear and have your prescription info saved at a single destination. (Don’t forget, the brand offers a line of sunglasses, too.) Further, you can take advantage of cross-product savings like a $50 eyewear credit when you buy an annual supply of contacts. Walgreens Shipping: Free standard shipping on contact lens-only orders, plus overnight option | Return policy: Returns accepted in unopened boxes, with some exceptions | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Unlike shopping through an eyewear site, Walgreens doesn’t offer vision-specific features like a virtual try-on option or extra-lenient return policy. However, making a purchase through the drugstore giant means competitive pricing and promos, a “ship to store option” and the ability to throw additional essentials into your cart. (And it’s especially convenient if you regularly shop on the Walgreens site, anyway.) Shipping is free on contact lens-only orders, and if you’re getting a mix of items, it’s free on purchases over $35. In the virtual contact lens “aisle,” you’ll find a wide selection at competitive prices, plus you can take advantage of stacked-on savings—right now, all contact lens orders are an extra 25% off with code CYBER25. The limited return policy allows you to return unopened boxes by mail if the order was incorrect, the product is defective or damaged, or you ordered the wrong prescription, and the lenses must still be in stock and unexpired. You can also use HSA and FSA funds to pay for your order. At Forbes Vetted, we’ve researched, tested and written a wide catalog of eyewear stories and roundups of the best personal care products on the market. The editors involved in writing, researching and editing this piece are contact lens-wearers and know what to look for when choosing an e-tailer for eyewear needs. As I compared popular retailers, I investigated inventory variety, shipping and return policies, and insurance and HSA and FSA eligibility. I also factored in virtual prescription renewals and customer service helpfulness, which contribute to the overall shopping experience. Shopping for contacts online is often more convenient and cost-effective than buying them at the optometrist’s office. That said, additional steps like uploading your prescription and shopping around for the best price can take some time. Here are the top things to consider when narrowing down contact lens e-tailers. If you’re already committed to a specific product, first make sure the retailer you’re considering has it in stock. This is especially true for specialty lenses, like those designed for astigmatism. If you’re not stuck on a particular brand, some eyewear companies offer value brand lenses; check out Aquasoft Dailies at 1-800 Contacts, Scout by Warby Parker and Hubble’s line of lenses. Just note, you may need a new prescription to switch brands, according to the FTC website. However, “You don’t need your prescriber’s approval to switch brands if a manufacturer offers a brand name and a generic or store brand version of the same lens,” it says. A big differentiating factor between many of our top contenders is the shopping experience, and each retailer caters to different needs. Consider whether you want the option to renew your prescription online, buy glasses and contacts in the same place, order (and save) in bulk, or receive a monthly delivery by subscription; we’ve included e-tailers that offer these conveniences and more. While many retailers offer free shipping, some still charge, so you’ll want to factor that into the overall price of your order. Hubble’s monthly subscription orders come with a $4 ship fee, but the model is helpful for those who don’t want to purchase a bunch of contacts up front; Contact Lens King’s ship fees are on the higher side starting at $10 to $13, but its low cost-per-box prices offer savings on larger orders. You want to be mindful of return policies as well, noting eligibility for return timeframes as well as product condition (for example, most e-tailers only accept returns of unopened boxes in original packaging). Further, some companies won’t reimburse you for shipping costs. If you prioritize a generous return policy, 1-800 Contacts has no time limit for returns, and you can send back any unused contacts, even if you’ve opened the box. You’ll find that pricing differs from one retailer to the next, but buyer beware: If you see a product with exceptionally low pricing, there’s a good chance that hidden fees, like excessive “processing” fees, will be added in cart, or the after-rebate price is being advertised (meaning you have to pay the full amount up front). E-tailers with price match guarantees like 1-800 Contacts, ContactsDirect and GlassesUSA give you added peace of mind if you find a lower price elsewhere. Plus, you can often take advantage of promotions for more savings at checkout. Buying your contacts online is just as safe as buying them in person, as long as you purchase from a reputable seller. All of our recommended websites feature the same brands of contacts that you’d find at an optical shop, including Acuvue and Bausch & Lomb. The main difference is that contacts purchased online are often less expensive than ones bought in a store. While your eye doctor’s office can offer rebate options, online contacts suppliers get lenses directly from manufacturers, skipping steps that add extra costs for you. Plus, they have access to massive warehouses, which allows them to give steeper discounts than you’d find at the doctor’s office. Further, several eyewear e-tailers offer price matching, meaning if you find your preferred contacts cheaper elsewhere, they’ll match (or beat) that price. This is the reason many people prefer buying contacts online—in addition to the convenience factor. No, you need to have a valid, current prescription from an eye doctor to purchase contacts online, as per the Federal Trade Commission. It also explains that prescription length varies by state, but is usually one to two years. If your prescription has expired and setting up an optometrist appointment is too much of a hassle, certain retailers allow you to renew your prescription from home with a virtual vision test. For example, 1-800 Contacts offers an ExpressExam feature that costs $20 and takes about 10 minutes to complete.

Title: Party City to close all of its stores, report says
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/party-city-close-stores-report-says-rcna185081

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Party City on Friday announced it will close all of its stores and has initiated corporate layoffs effective immediately, according to a CNN report. CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees in a meeting viewed by CNN that Party City has to “commence a winddown process immediately,” and that Friday would be their last day of work for the company. “That is without question the most difficult message that I’ve ever had to deliver,” Litwin said at the meeting, according to the report. CNN reported the company’s closure was due to ongoing financial challenges at the party supply retailer, which less than two years ago filed for bankruptcy protection over its inability to pay off $1.7 billion in debt. The New Jersey-based chain exited bankruptcy in September 2023 through a plan that included transitioning into a privately held company and canceling nearly $1 billion in debt. A majority of its 800 U.S. stores were able to stay open as it emerged from bankruptcy. Litwin was named CEO in August and said at the time he saw “many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers,” according to a press release. Prior to his appointment, he was the CEO of Global Industrial Company, a distribution leader in industrial products. Competition in the party goods and costume space has grown in recent years, including Spirit Halloween’s continued rise within and outside of the spooky season. The holiday costume chain announced in October that it would open 10 new “Spirit Christmas” stores, with some of the stores being converted from existing Spirit Halloween locations. Online retailers have also added pressure to Party City’s operation, even as the company began to offer items on Amazon in 2018. Representatives for Party City did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on CNN’s report or potential story closures. Read the full CNN report here.

Experts agree that the coming days are traditionally among the best of the year in which to go shopping for a new car, truck or SUV. The week between Christmas and New Year’s Day in particular is traditionally the period in which car shoppers can strike some of the sweetest new-car deals. Specifically, those who go out car shopping on New Year’s Eve can expect to obtain the deepest discounts of the month, with the next-best day being Christmas Eve, when few patrons tend to come walking through a dealership’s door. Already automakers are touting their holiday/year-end clearance sales promotions, with dealerships and salespeople expected to go all out to strike deals to both clear excess inventory and to qualify for bonuses for meeting year-end sales goals. The idea here is to capitalize on consumers who may still be in a spending mood, especially facing January and February, which are typically slower sales months. I scoured carmakers’ websites and found generous cash rebates to be the rule, rather than the exception as the calendar approaches 2025. Here, I’m listing 46 of the richest cash-back deals of $3,000 or more below that are good through the end of the year. The most money I found being slapped on the hood is on the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee, with rebates as large as $9,000. Many of the biggest cash-back deals are on electric vehicles, with several automakers offering $7,500 rebates on their batter-powered wares to level the proverbial playing field on models that do not otherwise qualify for the one-time federal tax credit. Otherwise, the biggest incentives tend to be among vehicles remaining in stock from the 2024 model-year, though several factory-fresh 2025 vehicles are nonetheless represented. Unfortunately, those looking for a deal on one of last-year’s models may have to settle on an unpopular color or feature combination, depending on what’s still remaining in inventory. There are also additional spiffs on some models, such as Ford offering a complimentary home charger and installation on its F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup truck and the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV. Automakers typically also offer extra rebates to recent college graduates, first responders and military members, as well as those currently owning or leasing a model from a qualifying brand. Note that the cash rebate offers cited below are in addition to the dealer’s discount, which should be generous on outgoing 2014 vehicles, as time is money in the new-car business. Be sure to factor in the value of a manufacturer’s cash rebate or promotional discount only after you’ve reached an agreeable transaction price with a salesperson. This is where a little advance research can go a long way. Start by visiting an online pricing site to determine the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) and establish a “target price” for any vehicle under consideration, including options. Traditionally this would be what’s noted as the “invoice price,” which is actually a few percent higher than the dealership’s actual cost. In some cases, especially with luxury-branded cars that aren’t usually sold with cash rebates, it could be a lot less. Automakers often offer their dealers what are often called “secret rebates” to enable additional room for deeper discounts as needed. However, be aware that automakers’ incentives often vary by region to address local supply and demand issues, and sometimes vary from one model’s trim level to another, so be sure to check a manufacturer’s website, usually under a “local offers” or “special deals” tab to confirm what’s being offered locally. In some cases you’ll find cash rebates combined with low, or even zero percent financing offers, which we’re featuring in a separate post. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The AI talent wars are just getting started

Time Published: 2024-12-20T20:26:09Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. For my last issue of the year, I’m focusing on the AI talent war, which is a theme I’ve been covering since this newsletter launched almost two years ago. And keep reading for the latest from inside Google and Meta this week. But first, I need your questions for a mailbag issue I’m planning for my first issue of 2025. You can submit questions via this form or leave them in the comments. This week, Databricks announced the largest known funding round for any private tech company in history. The AI enterprise firm is in the final stretch of raising $10 billion, almost all of which is going to go to buying back vested employee stock. How companies approach compensation is often undercovered in the tech industry, even though the strategies play a crucial role in determining which company gets ahead faster. Nowhere is this dynamic as intense as the war for AI talent, as I’ve covered before. To better understand what’s driving the state of play going into 2025, this week I spoke with Naveen Rao, VP of AI at Databricks. Rao is one of my favorite people to talk to about the AI industry. He’s deeply technical but also business-minded, having successfully sold multiple startups. His last company, MosaicML, sold to Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023. Now, he oversees the AI products for Databricks and is closely involved with its recruiting efforts for top talent. Our conversation below touches on the logic behind Databricks’s massive funding round, what specific AI talent remains scarce, why he thinks AGI is not imminent, and more. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity: Why is this round mostly to help employees sell stock? Because $10 billion is a lot. You can do a lot with that. The company is a little over 11 years old. There have been employees that have been here for a long time. This is a way to get them liquidity. Most people don’t understand that this is not going into the balance sheet of Databricks. This is largely going to provide liquidity for past employees, [and] liquidity going forward for current and new employees. It ends up being neutral on dilution because they’re shares that already exist. They’ve been allocated to employees and this allows them to sell those to cover the tax associated with those shares. How much of the rapid increases in AI company valuations have to do with the talent war? It’s real. The key thing here is that it’s not just pure AI talent — people who come up with the next big thing, the next big paper. We are definitely trying to hire those people. There is an entire infrastructure of software and cloud that needs to be built to support those things. When you build a model and you want to scale it, that actually is not AI talent, per se. It’s infrastructure talent. The perceived bubble that we’re in around AI has created an environment where all of those talents are getting recruited heavily. We need to stay competitive. Who is being the most aggressive with setting market rates for AI talent? OpenAI is certainly there. Anthropic. Amazon. Google. Meta. xAI. Microsoft. We’re in constant competition with all of these companies. Would you put the number of researchers who can build a new frontier model under 1,000? Yeah. That’s why the talent war is so hot. The leverage that a researcher has in an organization is unprecedented. One researcher’s ideas can completely change the product. That’s kind of new. In semiconductors, people who came up with a new transistor architecture had that kind of leverage. That’s why these researchers are so sought after. Somebody who comes up with the next big idea and the next big unlock can have a massive influence on the ability of a company to win. Do you see that talent pool expanding in the near future or is it going to stay constrained? I see some aspects of the pool expanding. Being able to build the appropriate infrastructure and manage it, those roles are expanding. The top-tier researcher side is the hard part. It’s like looking for LeBron James. There are just not very many humans who are capable of that. I would say the Inflection-style acquisitions were largely driven by this kind of mentality. You have these concentrations of top-tier talent in these startups and it sounds ridiculous how much people pay. But it’s not ridiculous. I think that’s why you see Google hiring back Noam Shazeer. It’s very hard to find another Noam Shazeer. A guy we had at my previous company that I started, Nervana, is arguably the best GPU programmer in the world. He’s at OpenAI now. Every inference that happens on an OpenAI model is running through his code. You start computing the downstream cost and it’s like, “Holy shit, this one guy saved us $4 billion.” “You start computing the downstream cost and it’s like, ‘Holy shit, this one guy saved us $4 billion.’” What’s the edge you have when you’re trying to hire a researcher to Databricks? You start to see some selection bias of different candidates. Some are AGI or bust, and that’s okay. It’s a great motivation for some of the smartest people out there. We think we’re going to get to AGI through building products. When people use technology, it gets better. That’s part of our pitch. AI is in a massive growth base but it’s also hit peak hype and is on the way down the Gartner hype curve. I think we’re on that downward slope right now, whereas Databricks has established a very strong business. That’s very attractive to some because I don’t think we’re so susceptible to the hype. Do the researchers you talk to really believe that AGI is right around the corner? Is there any consensus of when it’s coming? Honestly, there’s not a great consensus. I’ve been in this field for a very long time and I’ve been pretty vocal in saying that it’s not right around the corner. The large language model is a great piece of technology. It has massive amounts of economic uplift and efficiencies that can be gained by building great products around it. But it’s not the spirit of what we used to call AGI, which was human or even animal-like intelligence. These things are not creating magical intelligence. They’re able to slice up the space that we’re calling facts and patterns more easily. It’s not the same as building a causal learner. They don’t really understand how the world works. You may have seen Ilya Sutskever’s talk. We’re all kind of groping in the dark. Scaling was a big unlock. It was natural for a lot of people to feel enthusiastic about that. It turns out that we weren’t solving the right problem. Is the new idea that’s going to get to AGI the test-time compute or “reasoning” approach? No. I think it’s going to be an important thing for performance. We can improve the quality of answers, probably reduce the probability of hallucinations, and increase the probability of having responses that are grounded in fact. It’s definitely a positive for the field. But is it going to solve the fundamental problem of the spirit of AGI? I don’t believe so. I’m happy to be wrong, too. Do you agree with the sentiment that there’s a lot of room to build more good products with existing models, since they are so capable but still constrained by compute and access? Yeah. Meta started years later than OpenAI and Anthropic and they basically caught up, and xAI caught up extremely fast. I think it’s because the rate of improvement has essentially stopped. Nilay Patel compares the AI model race to early Bluetooth. Everyone keeps saying there’s a fancier Bluetooth but my phone still won’t connect. You see this with every product cycle. The first few versions of the iPhone were drastically better than the previous versions. Now, I can’t tell the difference between a three-year-old phone and a new phone. I think that’s what we see here. How we utilize these LLMs and the distribution that has been built into them to solve business problems is the next frontier.

Title: Is Under $10 RGTI Stock the Next 2025 NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street’s interest in quantum computing is growing daily, with market participants expecting it to have the same impact as generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the new year. As a result, a $2 billion quantum computing stock Rigetti Computing, Inc. RGTI has outperformed $3.2 trillion NVIDIA Corporation NVDA this year by a substantial margin (+495.3% vs. +164.7%), leaving the latter lagging in terms of growth. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research This year, NVIDIA’s shares have surged due to an increase in data center graphic processing unit (GPU) sales in the booming AI market. But why have Rigetti Computing’s shares recently skyrocketed, and is it a recommended buy for next year? Let’s see – Unlike traditional computers, quantum mechanics are being used by quantum computers to solve problems at a faster pace. Recently, a potential breakthrough in the quantum computing space by Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL AI division boosted quantum computing stocks including Rigetti Computing. Alphabet claimed that its advanced quantum computing chip, Willow, can reduce errors and pave the way for large-scale quantum computers. Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN recent announcement of its Quantum Embark program, which is designed to help organizations adopt quantum computing as per their needs also propelled quantum computing stocks higher, like Rigetti Computing. Furthermore, the U.S. lawmakers’ initiatives to push for $2.7 billion in funding for quantum computing boded well for the RGTI stock. The market size of global quantum computing is valued at $1.3 billion this year and is expected to witness a CAGR of 32.7% to $5.3 billion by 2029, according to marketsandmarkets. McKinsey estimated the value of the worldwide quantum computing market to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2035 as demand for quantum machine learning and optimization increases. Rigetti Computing is favorably placed to make the most of the growth in the quantum computing space, which should boost its share price. This is because Rigetti Computing empowers developers to use quantum computing resources, establishing its leadership in developing quantum computing systems. Rigetti Computing has already built an easy-to-access Quantum Cloud Services platform that works with traditional computer hardware and offers huge cost savings for clients. Rigetti Computing launched its new Novera quantum processor with 9 qubits, which has witnessed a rise in orders in Singapore. Rigetti Computing plans to deploy its 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system, roll out both modular and non-modular system architecture, and introduce a powerful 336-qubit system soon. Rigetti Computing plans to deploy new chip fabrication to reduce issues related to quantum computing like vulnerability to external factors such as noise. Thus, management expects revenues to grow in 2025 and the following year, after declining this year, a tell-tale sign that its share price is well-poised to scale upward in the near future. With Rigetti Computing shares expected to see much higher levels in the new year, stockholders should hold onto their positions. But new investors should wait and watch. After all, quantum computing is a highly speculative business in its nascent stage. Moreover, being a capital-intensive business, Rigetti Computing faces the risk of running out of cash while scaling up and tackling operational perils. For the time being, RGTI stock possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and it’s premature to predict if it will be the next NVIDIA.

CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees in a meeting viewed by CNN that Party City has to "commence a winddown process immediately," and that Friday would be their last day of work for the company. "That is without question the most difficult message that I've ever had to deliver," Litwin said at the meeting, according to the report. CNN reported the company's closure was due to ongoing financial challenges at the party supply retailer, which less than two years ago filed for bankruptcy protection over its inability to pay off $1.7 billion in debt. The New Jersey-based chain exited bankruptcy in September 2023 through a plan that included transitioning into a privately held company and canceling nearly $1 billion in debt. A majority of its 800 U.S. stores were able to stay open as it emerged from bankruptcy. Litwin was named CEO in August and said at the time he saw "many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers," according to a press release. Prior to his appointment, he was the CEO of Global Industrial Company, a distribution leader in industrial products. Competition in the party goods and costume space has grown in recent years, including Spirit Halloween's continued rise within and outside of the spooky season. The holiday costume chain announced in October that it would open 10 new "Spirit Christmas" stores, with some of the stores being converted from existing Spirit Halloween locations. Online retailers have also added pressure to Party City's operation, even as the company began to offer items on Amazon in 2018. Representatives for Party City did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on CNN's report or potential story closures. Read the full CNN report here. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Nvidia stock has another 23% upside and the success of Blackwell will be the chipmaker's big story of 2025, Morgan Stanley says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-prediction-nvda-blackwell-demand-gpu-ai-2025-2024-12

Nvidia's Blackwell chip will be the company's biggest story in 2025 — and the success of the next-gen GPU will overshadow any lingering concerns investors may still have, Morgan Stanley said. In a note this week, the bank reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia stock and said the chipmaker remained its "top pick" going into next year. The bank's bullishness is being fueled by the expected success of Blackwell — Nivida's next-gen artificial intelligence-enabling chip. The bank issued a price target of $166 a share, implying a 23% increase from where the stock was trading on Friday around $134.82 "We have tended to be most enthusiastic on NVIDIA when the near-term data points appear mixed, but underlying dynamics are very strong. We think we are approaching that point now," the analysts wrote in a note. "There are transitional pressures — but by 2h25 the only topic will be the strength of blackwell, in our view." Investors are already feeling bullish about the Blackwell chips, which are expected to launch in early 2025. Nvidia shares rallied earlier this year after CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the chip was "insane," boosting Wall Street's expectations for continued earnings growth. The chip will likely be the "driving force behind revenue" in the second half of next year, which could mean "significant upside for the stock," Morgan Stanley added. The success of its new chip could also dispel a handful of near- to medium-term anxieties investors have about the stock. "We think there are a number of concerns here, some of which are overstated, some of which are anxiety-inducing short term but we believe irrelevant longer term," the bank said, highlighting four issues investors have been worried about in particular. Investors are concerned about slowing builds for Hopper, Nvidia's current generation of AI chips. On its latest earnings call, the company forecast just 69.5% revenue growth for the fourth quarter, its slowest revenue forecast in seven quarters. But the slowdown in Hopper builds is a "non-issue," Morgan Stanley said. "The reason, of course, is that we are a few quarters until Hopper end of life. We would not correlate Hopper builds with Hopper revenue, which will persist for 3 more quarters or so, but there is a strong backlog of builds already coming through, so it's time to slow starts," analysts wrote. Investors may also be concerned that not all of its Blackwell products will ship at the same time. Nvidia said would release seven variants of its Blackwell GPU. "We are hearing anxiety about some of the types that aren't ready, and we aren't discounting that there may be some timing challenges with some of the product types," analysts said. They continued: "All fair, but all of the Blackwells should get sold, even if this drives allocation from one customer to another, and we think that this persists all year. This is not a concern that should linger." Concerns about Blackwell's rollout should "completely disappear" by the second half of next year, the bank said. Analysts noted that Nvidia has seen some of its value being "directly" transferred into other chipmakers in recent months. The bank pointed to companies like Broadcom and Marvel, two firms that produce ASICs, which are custom AI chips that serve as an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. "But in 2025, we believe that the biggest users of ASICs will actually see purchasing shift back towards GPUs, based on conversations with those customers," Morgan Stanley said. "While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year." The big AI chip customers are seeing benefits to scaling GPU cluster sizes, which allows for more advanced computing. But some financial backers in the space are raising questions about whether the returns of doing so are worth it, the bank said. "Both constituencies matter, we can't rule out a consolidation in that portion of the market," analysts said. "But we note that many of the innovations that Nvidia has delivered in recent years are aimed at enhancing the efficiency of large clusters," they added, pointing to developments like Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox, another chipmaker that will help it expand into the market for data center supplies. "Even with any concerns about the AGI arms race cooling down the road, the growth in inference, the growth in sovereign training, the growth in enterprise training applications, and are all multi-year growth drivers, and make up 70% or so of data center revenue, so even with some consolidation in the arms race we should still see enduring growth potential," the analysts added. Even after a 170% rally in 2024, forecasters are still generally bullish on Nvidia going into next year. The continued excitement around the AI trade in the stock market is among the top themes investors see shaping the stock market in 2025. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A semiconductor production line, showing the complex procedures of chip manufacture. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated revenue worth $35.1 billion, up by 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. Most of the demand was propelled by the market’s growing AI needs in hardware especially. The company’s growing demand for its data center services and its Blackwell AI chip has ramped up expectations for the coming year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been lagging compared to its record close last month. However, despite that analysts remain bullish on the stock, tying great expectations to its growth potential. On November 21, CFRA Research senior equity analyst, Angelo Zino, joined Yahoo Finance where he discussed his thesis on the stock. Zino shared that the stock has enormous cash flow potential, given the demand projections for its Blackwell AI chip and data center services. He also added that the stock has solid financials and will continue to exceed expectations in the coming year. Zino emphasized that investors must not read “too much” into the guidance especially because making a complex technology demands time. Overall, analysts are also bullish on NVDA and their median price target of $175 points to an upside of nearly 35%. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Top 10 Investment Themes For 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/12/20/top-10-investment-themes-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T18:23:18Z
Full Content:
Will the bull market continue into 2025? Happy New Year, all. My overall macro theme for 2024 was An Expansion of the Rally. The theme ultimately proved to be accurate, as the dominance of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta Platforms) dissipated during the second half of the year as the other “Not So Magnificent 493” stocks (i.e., the remaining stocks of the S&P 500 Index) took over the leadership role. The Magnificent 7 accounted for 62% of the total return of the S&P 500 in 2023, and 59% during the first0 half of 2024, but just 9.2% during the third quarter of 2024. This passing of the baton is important, healthy and constructive for the continuation of the current bull market run, which is now over two years old, with a cumulative return of 74.2% as of November 29, 2024. For perspective on this front, prior to the current bull market, according to data from Yardeni Research and Yahoo! Finance, there have been 12 bull markets since 1946 and the average duration of those bull markets was 5.3 years, with an average cumulative return of 177.5%. Of course, this time could be different, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Stock market leadership was not the only significant transition that took place in 2024. The U.S. election concluded with a transition in the White House and Senate as the Republicans now control all three legs of the federal government stool, given that they also maintained control of the House of Representatives. Time will tell what this transition will mean in terms of policy implementations and their impacts on economic and stock market growth. The Federal Reserve also transitioned from an inflation-fighting, higher interest rate environment to the beginning stages of what will likely be a multi-year rate-cutting campaign. They kicked off the campaign with 100 bp (1%) in rate cuts towards the latter stages of 2024. According to the Fed's final 2024 release of their infamous "Dot Plot" chart in December, they are forecasting another 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2025 and 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2026. The Fed is also forecasting inflation, as measured by Core PCE, to decrease to 2.5% in 2025 and then decrease further to 2.2% in 2026. As a result, I see the theme for 2025 as Growth Opportunities Ahead. This theme does not imply that all areas of the market will move higher in the new year because they likely will not. It also does not mean the economy will experience exponential growth because it likely will not. Finally, it does not imply that periods of short-term bouts of volatility will not happen, as they likely will, given current valuations and the many geopolitical and central bank uncertainties that lie ahead. What it does suggest, however, is that the next four years will undoubtedly look very different than the prior four years, and the next decade will look very different than the last decade. Over the shorter term, the outlook for lower interest rates and inflation, coupled with expected economic growth and stability under a Trump Administration (with the support of Congress), provides tailwinds for potential growth opportunities in both equities and fixed income. However, while I see numerous growth opportunities ahead in 2025, investors would be wise to be selective as growth will likely be less than what the stock market experienced in the prior two years and more pronounced in certain areas of the market than others. Some of these areas are highlighted below. 1. Bull Market and Earnings Growth Expansion: For the breadth of the bull market to continue to expand, the breadth of the earnings rally also needs to expand. Fortunately, both of these expansions began during the second half of 2024, and I believe that the momentum will carry forward through 2025. In terms of earnings growth, according to FactSet, the per-share operating earnings growth pace for the overall S&P 500 Index is currently forecasted at 15%. As a result, expanding beyond, but not necessarily abandoning, U.S. large-cap stocks is worthy of consideration for the new year. Expansion candidates would include U.S. mid-cap, U.S. small-cap and international stocks (predominantly international developed market stocks) that pay attractive dividends, have a history of price performance, and are poised for total return potential ahead. 2. The Long Game of Artificial Intelligence Investing: In terms of where we are in the timeline of artificial intelligence (AI), I believe that we are just in batting practice of a double-header with so many more opportunities that lie ahead in the development and application of AI. According to Faist, as of June 11, 2024, the global AI market is expected to reach $1.81 trillion by 2030, with a 36.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, investors and companies need to be patient with their investments in this revolutionary technology, as some may not necessarily see a return on their investment for years to come. As I see it, the AI revolution road is a long one with many potholes that will create many winners and many losers. As a result, as opposed to just trying to find the next Nvidia or hot chips/semiconductor company, investors should consider potential investment opportunities in the entire AI Ecosystem, which is comprised of data centers, software, hardware and chips/semiconductors. Data centers and their associated tremendous need for power and cooling solutions, in particular, have become a critical component of the AI ecosystem. 3. Increased Investment in Defense and Security: U.S. defense and national security needs to focus on replenishment, upgrades and modernization, addressing gaps in naval readiness, advancing missile defense systems highlighted by recent conflicts, and integrating cutting-edge technologies like autonomous systems (i.e. drones) to meet evolving global threats. Fortunately, more spending is on the way as defense spending in the United States is predicted to increase every year over the next decade, totaling approximately $1.1 trillion in 2034–that represents an increase of over 20% vs. 2023 and 263% vs. 2000, according to Statista Research Department as of July 5, 2024. Companies that play a pivotal role in areas such as enhancing military readiness, advancing missile defense systems, and driving technological innovation in autonomous and defense technologies stand to benefit from the increases in investment and spending in these areas. 4. Fed Adopts More Gradual Pace toward Interest Rate Cuts: According to its updated Dot Plot chart (see below), the Fed is currently forecasting 50 bp in additional rate cuts in 2025 and another 50 bp in rate cuts in 2026. All this would follow the 100 bp in rate cuts that the Fed enacted during the latter stages of 2024. These cuts align with their long-run neutral rate expectation of around 3.0%. In terms of the pace of their cuts, I believe that the Fed will adopt a more gradual pace of easing in 2025 and 2026 with no single rate cuts of greater than 25 bp until the Fed Funds Target Rate is closer to their long-run neutral rate expectation of 3% (which may not be achieved by the end of 2026), given the many uncertainties surrounding the labor market, inflation, potential tariffs, and the policies to be implemented by the incoming administration. Regardless of the pace and extent of this rate-cutting campaign, it has become abundantly clear that interest rates will be lower in 2025 and over the next two years. As a result, investing in areas of the market likely to benefit from a declining interest rate environment is worthy of consideration. These areas may include, but are not limited to, certain sectors of equities, such as healthcare, information technology, consumer staples, financials, communication services and consumer discretionary, as well as bonds of different credit qualities, with an overweight towards investment grade. Federal Reserve "Dot Plot" Chart as of December 18, 2024 FOMC Dot Plot Chart December 18, 2024 5. Large Cap Pharma Turns to Small Cap Biotech for Answers: Large-cap pharmaceutical companies face multiple headwinds as they continue to have their profit margins pressured by Washington D.C.'s push to lower drug prices and larger revenue-producing drugs that have come off patent or are scheduled to see come off patent and be challenged by lower generic drug prices. One answer to their revenue quandary can be found in the innovative healthcare solutions being developed by smaller-cap biotech firms. These innovative healthcare solutions, which are now being assisted by artificial intelligence developments in certain cases, include but are not limited to gene therapies, RNA therapeutics, precision and target oncology treatments such as CAR-T cell therapies, and, of course, obesity drug breakthroughs such as GLP-1. In 2024, according to BioPharma Drive, as of November 26, there were 36 Biotech M&A transactions totaling just over $45 billion, the latter well below expectations coming into the year as many of the deals involved smaller companies. However, the average premium paid for the 36 transactions in 2024 was an impressive 83%. Looking ahead to 2025, many analysts are optimistic that the total number and total money amount of biotech-related M&A transactions will increase. To this end, PwC, in its "Pharmaceutical and life sciences: U.S. Deals 2025 outlook," expects transactions between $5 billion and $15 billion to see sustained activity in 2025 while recognizing geopolitical factors that could bring headwinds. Investors thus need to find those smaller-cap biotech companies with existing breakthroughs or innovative drugs in the FDA approval pipeline that large-cap pharmaceutical companies desire to add to their platforms and thus have the greatest chance of being acquired. Small-and mid-cap biotech companies with strong pipelines and focused therapies, such as rare diseases, RNA-based therapies or advanced immunology, according to Biopharma Boardroom, appear to have the most appeal to potential large-cap pharmaceutical acquirers in the current environment. Looking for those companies with related drugs in Phase II or Phase III of the FDA approval process is a good starting point for identifying potential investment opportunities. 6. Munis Poised to Perform: Tax free income is always attractive to income-oriented investors, particularly investors in higher tax brackets. I anticipate this level of attraction being heightened in 2025. Heading into the new year, the balance sheets of many local and state governments are relatively strong, and the positive outlook for employment and the economy in 2025 should bode well for the tax revenues of many municipalities. Additionally, comparable yields of municipal bonds are currently and should remain, very attractive to investors. According to data from Schwab* as of December 3. 2024, the tax-equivalent yield of munis for an investor in the top tax bracket is near its high over the past 15 years. Concerns over the potential repeal of the municipal bond exemption appear now to be overblown, setting the stage for what could be a high level of demand for municipal bonds and municipal bond-oriented strategies in the new year. Lower short-term interest rates should also benefit municipal closed-end fund (CEF) strategies that employ leverage, many of which are still trading at a discount to their net asset values (NAVs). 7. Financials (including Regional Banks) Rebound: Many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis and ensuing hangover have seemingly abated as short-term interest rates have declined (and are forecasted to decline further), the prices of U.S. Treasurys have increased, and the prospects for more economic growth and less regulation have increased following the election of Donald Trump. Less regulation and lower potential capital requirements could also lead to great industry consolidation via an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To this end, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Fitzgibbon said in a Banking Dive article that he expects 2025 and 2026 to see robust bank M&A activity and that deal approvals, under a Trump administration, will speed up markedly and the process will be more clearly delineated. Regional banks rebounded during the latter half of 2024. I believe that the rebound will extend, and more potential upside remains for certain regional banks in 2025. 8. Preferreds Benefit from Financials Rebound and Lower Interest Rates: Preferred securities represent ownership in a corporation and have both bond and stock-like features. Preferreds generally pay a fixed income, have a par value, hold a credit rating, and trade on major exchanges. They also typically have a higher stated dividend payout than the corporation's common shares and even bonds. Despite these features, they are often not considered by investors to help meet their respective income and growth needs, and perhaps they should be. Preferreds did suffer a pullback following the regional bank crisis that began back in March 2023 with the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank, given that banks are typically the largest issuer of preferred securities and contagion risk was at the forefront of many investors' mindsets. However, as discussed earlier, many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis have now dissipated, creating attractive entry points for many preferred securities that have not yet fully recovered from the pullback and potential total return opportunities ahead. 9. Look to Sources of Power to Help Power Your Returns: Data centers are forecasted to use up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, more than doubling their current consumption, according to Reuters as of May 29, 2024. Electricity is stretched in the U.S., and our electricity grid is antiquated and unreliable. As a result, the data centers that serve as the nervous system of the AI ecosystem will need to look beyond traditional energy sources, such as electricity, and alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas and nuclear energy, to help provide the massive amount of power they need. As it relates to natural gas, S&P Global Ratings estimates that U.S. data centers' increasing energy demands will lead to additional gas demand of between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, from a starting point of almost none today. As it relates to nuclear energy, Goldman Sachs believes that we are in the early stages of a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and globally as it relates to data center power demand in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) and larger-scale nuclear power plants. Companies that provide products or services in these areas stand to benefit from all of this anticipated demand for power in the new year. 10. Expect More Short-Term Bouts of Volatility but Don't Abandon Stocks: In 2024, as of December 2, there were only 16 days where the S&P 500 Index moved by more than 1.5% in a given trading day–and 7 of those 16 days were positive moves! This amount translates to just 3% of the trading days involving a downside move of 1.5% or more, representing a historically low level of volatility and should not be expected to continue throughout 2025. The S&P 500 also saw 54 record closes in 2024, as of December 2, so valuations are rich, and smaller-scale corrections are possible. These corrections, of course, can be met by money coming off the sidelines to take advantage of more attractive entry points. The potential for more volatility in 2025 does not mean that investors should try to time the market, as timing the market is often an exercise in futility, and "staying on the sidelines" for too long can have a negative impact on achieving longer-term financial goals. Rather, a more balanced approach towards stock market positioning, perhaps through equal-weighted strategies, covered calls, or more defensive stocks, may be worthy of consideration for certain investors and/or portions of their overall portfolios. Best wishes for a productive and successful 2025! * Source: Schwab, Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 12/3/2024.

Small-and mid-cap biotech companies with strong pipelines and focused therapies, such as rare diseases, RNA-based therapies or advanced immunology, according to Biopharma Boardroom, appear to have the most appeal to potential large-cap pharmaceutical acquirers in the current environment. Looking for those companies with related drugs in Phase II or Phase III of the FDA approval process is a good starting point for identifying potential investment opportunities. 6. Munis Poised to Perform: Tax free income is always attractive to income-oriented investors, particularly investors in higher tax brackets. I anticipate this level of attraction being heightened in 2025. Heading into the new year, the balance sheets of many local and state governments are relatively strong, and the positive outlook for employment and the economy in 2025 should bode well for the tax revenues of many municipalities. Additionally, comparable yields of municipal bonds are currently and should remain, very attractive to investors. According to data from Schwab* as of December 3. 2024, the tax-equivalent yield of munis for an investor in the top tax bracket is near its high over the past 15 years. Concerns over the potential repeal of the municipal bond exemption appear now to be overblown, setting the stage for what could be a high level of demand for municipal bonds and municipal bond-oriented strategies in the new year. Lower short-term interest rates should also benefit municipal closed-end fund (CEF) strategies that employ leverage, many of which are still trading at a discount to their net asset values (NAVs). 7. Financials (including Regional Banks) Rebound: Many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis and ensuing hangover have seemingly abated as short-term interest rates have declined (and are forecasted to decline further), the prices of U.S. Treasurys have increased, and the prospects for more economic growth and less regulation have increased following the election of Donald Trump. Less regulation and lower potential capital requirements could also lead to great industry consolidation via an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To this end, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Fitzgibbon said in a Banking Dive article that he expects 2025 and 2026 to see robust bank M&A activity and that deal approvals, under a Trump administration, will speed up markedly and the process will be more clearly delineated. Regional banks rebounded during the latter half of 2024. I believe that the rebound will extend, and more potential upside remains for certain regional banks in 2025. 8. Preferreds Benefit from Financials Rebound and Lower Interest Rates: Preferred securities represent ownership in a corporation and have both bond and stock-like features. Preferreds generally pay a fixed income, have a par value, hold a credit rating, and trade on major exchanges. They also typically have a higher stated dividend payout than the corporation's common shares and even bonds. Despite these features, they are often not considered by investors to help meet their respective income and growth needs, and perhaps they should be. Preferreds did suffer a pullback following the regional bank crisis that began back in March 2023 with the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank, given that banks are typically the largest issuer of preferred securities and contagion risk was at the forefront of many investors' mindsets. However, as discussed earlier, many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis have now dissipated, creating attractive entry points for many preferred securities that have not yet fully recovered from the pullback and potential total return opportunities ahead. 9. Look to Sources of Power to Help Power Your Returns: Data centers are forecasted to use up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, more than doubling their current consumption, according to Reuters as of May 29, 2024. Electricity is stretched in the U.S., and our electricity grid is antiquated and unreliable. As a result, the data centers that serve as the nervous system of the AI ecosystem will need to look beyond traditional energy sources, such as electricity, and alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas and nuclear energy, to help provide the massive amount of power they need. As it relates to natural gas, S&P Global Ratings estimates that U.S. data centers' increasing energy demands will lead to additional gas demand of between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, from a starting point of almost none today. As it relates to nuclear energy, Goldman Sachs believes that we are in the early stages of a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and globally as it relates to data center power demand in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) and larger-scale nuclear power plants. Companies that provide products or services in these areas stand to benefit from all of this anticipated demand for power in the new year. 10. Expect More Short-Term Bouts of Volatility but Don't Abandon Stocks: In 2024, as of December 2, there were only 16 days where the S&P 500 Index moved by more than 1.5% in a given trading day–and 7 of those 16 days were positive moves! This amount translates to just 3% of the trading days involving a downside move of 1.5% or more, representing a historically low level of volatility and should not be expected to continue throughout 2025. The S&P 500 also saw 54 record closes in 2024, as of December 2, so valuations are rich, and smaller-scale corrections are possible. These corrections, of course, can be met by money coming off the sidelines to take advantage of more attractive entry points. The potential for more volatility in 2025 does not mean that investors should try to time the market, as timing the market is often an exercise in futility, and "staying on the sidelines" for too long can have a negative impact on achieving longer-term financial goals. Rather, a more balanced approach towards stock market positioning, perhaps through equal-weighted strategies, covered calls, or more defensive stocks, may be worthy of consideration for certain investors and/or portions of their overall portfolios. Best wishes for a productive and successful 2025! * Source: Schwab, Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 12/3/2024.

UPDATED 13:04 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof The bottomless pit of funding for all things artificial intelligence remains… bottomless. Case in point: This week Databricks raised more money than God. That’s going to be one monster IPO next year (maybe) if the economy holds up. Meanwhile, Perplexity raised $500 million for its AI search and immediately bought AI startup Carbon. And continuing the AI funding bubble boom, Sandbox AQ raised $300 million. But the business is real, as AI is expected to drive enterprise tech upside next year. The bubble boom in AI models is continuing too, as Google, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta and others all released new models and ways to use and access them. Salesforce also beefed up its just recently introduced AI agent platform Agentforce. But OpenAI faces legal headwinds as Elon Musk and Meta both opposed its plans to create a for-profit company. Neobank Chime filed confidentially for an initial public offering next year, following ServiceTitan’s IPO last week. Is a thawing in the works this winter? Dave Vellante and David Floyer have a plan to revive Intel’s chip foundry business, but it’s going to take a lot of cooperation by some powerful companies and the government. Cyber consolidation keeps chugging along, as Arctic Wolf bought BlackBerry’s Cylance unit and Cisco bought SnapAttack. Elsewhere in technology, TikTok’s bid to survive in the U.S. will go to the Supreme Court next month. Your guess as to what the Supremes will do is as good as mine. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod out today on YouTube.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 800 points on Friday, buoyed by inflation data that helped the market rebound from the losses earlier this week. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is regarded as the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose a modest 0.1% in November compared to the previous month. On an annual basis, the PCE price index reflected a 2.4% inflation rate — slightly above the Fed’s long-term target of 2%, but notably below analysts’ consensus estimate of 2.5%. The cooler inflation data is expected to ease concerns about persistent price pressures, raising hopes that the Fed may reduce interest rates more than twice in 2025. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added over 796 points or 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 1.8% each. AI stocks rebounded on Friday morning, emerging as the top-performing stocks. Nvidia (NVDA+3.19%), which experienced a sharp sell-off earlier in the week, climbed 2.3%, trading at $133 per share. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.17%) and Broadcom (AVGO+5.33%) were up 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively. Bitcoin sunk below $92,000 early Friday before recovering some ground on the heels of the Federal Reserve signaling a slowdown in interest rate cuts for 2025. The leading cryptocurrency was hovering around $96,000 on Friday morning, down about 7.7% over the past day. Bitcoin has slumped more than 10% since the start of the week when it hit highs of more than $106,000. – Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: A next-gen Ozempic falls short in a drug trial — and Novo Nordisk stock plunges 20%

Novo Nordisk (NVO+4.54%) released mixed clinical-trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Friday, leaving Wall Street disappointed. The pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, said its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug CagriSema fell short of expectations. The drug did not achieve the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by the company and analysts. Instead, patients in the phase 3 clinical trial lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s current weight-loss drug on the market, resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+3.66%) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks. Novo Nordisk stock fell over 20% on Friday morning following the news. CagriSema belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, which was made popular by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.65%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. That’s why several pharma companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss meds. Novo Nordisk was betting that by mimicking multiple hormones, it could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. Still, the trial did deliver some promising results. Novo Nordisk reported that 40.4% of patients taking CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 25% or more over the 68-week trial period. The company is expected to reveal results of a second phase 3 trial of the drug in the first half of 2025. Eli Lilly and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX-0.27%), which are also developing next-gen weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 5% and 3%, respectively, on Friday.

Title: What's Next For FDX Stock?

A FedEx cargo flight arrives at Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport in Qingdao, east China's ... [+] Shandong Province, Nov. 11, 2024. TO GO WITH "Interview: FedEx Asia Pacific president upbeat about China's thriving logistics sector" (Photo by Li Ziheng/Xinhua via Getty Images) FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) is expected to see higher levels after it announced the spin-off of its freight business. While this move was awaited, it bodes well for the stock, unlocking shareholder value. The division is estimated to be worth over $30 billion. [1] Although FedEx’s freight business accounted for only 10% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2024, it was far more profitable, with 20% operating margin, versus 2% for Express and 12% for the Ground segment. The spin-off will help FedEx focus on the core delivery business and improve its profitability. While FDX stock may see higher levels in the near term, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. FDX stock has fared well in recent years, with 66% gains since early 2023. This can be attributed to a 2x rise in the company’s trailing P/E ratio from 8x to 16x; partly offset by an 18% fall in adjusted earnings from $20.61 in 2022 to $16.92 now. The earnings decline is a result of lower revenues and margin contraction. FedEx’s revenue declined 6% from $93.5 billion in 2022 to $87.6 billion now, due to lower e-commerce volumes compared to the peak during the pandemic, rising costs pushing customers to cheaper alternatives, and a reduced international shipping demand, among other factors. The company’s adjusted net margin declined by 110 bps over this period due to higher operational costs, including labor and rentals. Notably, the increase in FDX stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 1% in 2021, -32% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the changes in the White House, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? After today’s expected rise following the spin-off development, we think FDX stock will be fairly priced. At levels of around $285, FDX stock trades at 17x trailing adjusted earnings of $16.92 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 16x over the last two years. Now, with the freight business spin-off, a rise in valuation multiple for FDX seems justified, and the stock may see higher levels. We currently estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, aligning with its current levels. We will soon update our model to reflect the impact of the spin-off. While FDX stock looks fairly priced, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Why Novo Nordisk (NVO) Is Plummeting Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock is tumbling 21% today after individuals who received the company's experimental weight-loss drug shed many fewer pounds than expected. Specifically, the weight of patients who received Novo's anti-obesity drug, CagriSema, declined by an average of 20.4% in 68 weeks, versus the 25% average weight loss that Novo had expected the treatment to produce. A closeup shot of a laboratory technician handling a medical device used for fertility treatments. The company, however, stated that if all the patients who were tested had complied 100% with the treatment requirements, their mean weight loss would have been 22.7% and 40% of the trial participants would have shed at least 25% of their weight. Reporting that only 57% of patients in the trial received the highest dose of CagriSema, Novo stated that it was "encouraged" by the data and added that it intends to launch an additional trial of the drug by June 2025. Roughly 3,400 individuals were involved in the trial. Taken weekly as an injection, CagriSema consists of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which is similar to the hunger-suppressing hormone called GLP-1, is also the main ingredient of Novo's anti-obesity drug, Wegovy. The latter treatment is already being widely used to combat obesity in the U.S. Cagrilintide acts similarly to a pancreas-based hormone called amylin. The average weight loss of the patients who took CagriSema was similar to the mean weight declines of individuals who have taken Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound treatment. Novo Nordisk had hoped that CagriSema would surpass Zeopbound's performance. LLY stock is advancing 7.5% in early trading. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Years ago, these index reconstitutions had very little impact on trading. Not anymore. The explosion of index-based ETFs has changed all that. Today, roughly $16 trillion is indexed to the S&P 500. The largest Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ), has $321 billion in assets, and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 Index mutual fund (IVNQX) has about $100 billion in assets, so we are talking well north of $400 billion in additional assets pegged to the Nasdaq-100. Bottom line: what stocks are added to or deleted from these large indexes matters a lot. If you doubt that being included in a large index matters, just ask Palantir Technologies. It apparently believes it is very important. On November 14, the company issued a three-sentence (!) press release announcing that it was transferring its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market. Palantir concluded with this: "Upon transferring, Palantir anticipates meeting the eligibility requirements of the Nasdaq-100 Index." Can't make it any plainer than that. And Palantir got its wish. It's being added to the Nasdaq-100 at the close of trading on Friday. Two companies are being added to the S&P 500: Apollo Global Management and Workday. Qorvo and Amentum are being removed. Most people think the S&P 500 is the 500 largest companies in the United States, but it's more complicated than that. There are a number of requirements that have to be met to get into the S&P 500, including a minimum market capitalization of $18 billion. However, there is no obligation to mechanically include only the 500 largest companies by market capitalization: "Constituent selection is at the discretion of the Index Committee and is based on the eligibility criteria," S&P Global's methodology paper says. For S&P, adding Apollo (financials) and Workday (technology) are relatively safe choices. At $96 billion and $70 billion in market cap, both are squarely in the large-cap segment of the market. Still, many investors were hoping that Coinbase Global, which has a similar market cap to Workday ($68 billion) would be added to the S&P 500. It certainly qualifies based on market capitalization and profitability (it's been profitable the last four quarters). But Coinbase is a far more volatile stock than either Apollo or Workday. Coinbase did not make the cut. It's not clear why, but perhaps because the S&P Index Committee was concerned about the volatility. Coinbase is one of the most volatile of all stocks. This year alone, it has moved from a low of $117 to about $350, a 200% move. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but Coinbase was down 9% the day after the S&P inclusion announcement was made, and the cryptocurrency platform was excluded. Sometimes just determining where a stock should be classified can be a big issue, especially when big money is involved. Going into the Nasdaq-100 are MicroStrategy, Palantir and Axon Enterprise. Going out are Illumina, Super Micro Computer and Moderna. To enter the Nasdaq-100, a company has to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market, have a free float of at least 10% and, while there is no minimum or maximum market capitalization requirement, the annual reconstitution (determining who goes in and out), is loosely based on market capitalization: "The Nasdaq-100 Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies," Nasdaq says in its Index Methodology paper. Note the requirement that any entrant be a "non-financial stock." Based on market capitalization, MicroStrategy has certainly earned its spot in the Nasdaq-100. It has been a monster this year, up over 400%, and now sports a market cap of about $80 billion. That alone would put MicroStrategy in the top half of the Nasdaq-100 by market value. Like Coinbase, it is a very volatile stock (trading range in 2024: $50 to $500). More interesting is the fact that MicroStrategy is listed as a technology stock, but given that about half its value is in bitcoin (it owns 439,000 bitcoin with a current value about $42 billion), is it accurate to call it a tech stock? Chairman Michael Saylor has said he wants to run MicroStrategy as a "bitcoin bank." Should we take him at his word? Should MicroStrategy be classified as a financial stock, which would make it ineligible to be in the Nasdaq-100? For the moment, it's classified as a technology stock. Whether it stays there is uncertain. There's this thing called the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), which is the system developed to categorize public companies into specific industries and sectors. There are periodic reviews to make sure companies are in their appropriate sectors. But that is for another day. For the moment, Bitcoin fans are loving it. Their darling is in the Nasdaq-100. Whether index fans will love it is yet to be determined. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Nvidia’s (NVDA) Run:AI Deal Isn’t A ‘Killer Acquisition’, says EU

Nvidia just received good news from Europe as The European Commission approved its acquisition of the Israeli firm Run:ai. The acquisition was announced in April but received a setback when European regulators took notice in October and decided to investigate the merger. Almost all tech companies continue to be under heavy scrutiny of late as regulators don’t want a handful of companies to take control of global technological development, especially at a time when a sensitive technology like Artificial Intelligence is in the early stages of development. In this particular case, it was the Italian regulators that flagged the buyout, using what they refer to as a ‘killer acquisition’ card (Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulations). A killer acquisition, according to the commission, is when a large company buys out a smaller company with the intention of shutting down the target company’s innovation or preventing it from becoming a future competitor. This is a complex issue in Europe and one that is likely to be heard more often than before in the future. But for now, Nvidia is safe and can go ahead with the buyout. The investigation was based on whether the acquisition would disrupt the GPU supply and GPU orchestration software market. As things stand, the startup doesn’t have any significant market share in the orchestration software market. An orchestration software plays the same role as the conductor in an orchestra. It helps manage and automate interactions between various components of a data center, including servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and applications that are running on the data center. The commission also noted that customers will still be able to access the services of Run:ai’s competitors. Even though the details of the deal were never made public, a rough estimate of the acquisition cost stands at $700 million. Nvidia will now be able to reduce the number of GPUs needed to complete a task by making multiple workloads run in parallel using Run:AI’s software. Nvidia is 5th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 193 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the third quarter which was 179 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures sell-off as government shutdown looms, inflation data improves but still sticky

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pointed to another rough day on Wall Street Friday after the House of Representatives voted against a Trump-backed spending bill, further increasing the odds of a US government shutdown this weekend. Investors also digested key inflation data that showed a deceleration in price increases during the month of November after the Federal Reserve lowered the number of cuts it expects next year. Markets improved throughout the morning but futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) still dropped around 0.5%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) plunged 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also fell around 0.2%. A Fed-induced sell-off earlier in the week left the major averages reeling. And although stocks mostly stabilized on Thursday, the threat of a government shutdown, coupled with more Trump tariff threats on Europe, pressured global markets across the board. "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!" Global chip stocks sold off premarket, with Europe's ASML (ASML) dropping nearly 2% early Friday while Taiwan's TSMC (TSMC34.SA) fell about 3%. US-based names such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) also came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices retreated nearly 10% from earlier highs to drop below the critical $100,000 mark amid record ETF outflows. And in individual names, Novo Nordisk (NVO) plunged about 20% — the most in over two decades — after its obesity drug trial disappointed investors. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 6% after recalling about 700,000 US vehicles over a tire pressure monitoring system defect. Meanwhile, investors received another piece of the inflation puzzle with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices.

On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm.

Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

The Nvidia Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... [+] United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock fall by about 50% to levels of around $65 in the near term from the roughly $130 level it is at currently? We believe this is a real possibility. Nvidia has seen its business boom, led by the surging demand for its graphics processing units which have emerged as the de facto silicon for running artificial intelligence applications. However, there are multiple risks on the horizon. These include a potential cooling of AI training-related demand, mounting competition, and less attractive valuation multiples assigned by investors, due to slowing growth and less favorable monetary policy. We spell out the key risks for Nvidia in more detail and break down how the stock could fall by over 50% from current levels by looking at three metrics, namely the company’s revenue growth, margins, and price-to-earnings multiple. See our counter scenario on Nvidia Stock upside to $300. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. While AI has been all the rage, quantum computing could be the next big thing. See What’s Driving D-Wave Quantum Stock? and also Palantir Stock: Buy, Sell, Or Hold? Nvidia’s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. Nvidia’s revenues were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, growth is slowly cooling off. Nvidia’s sales expanded by about 122% in the most recent quarter. There remains a possibility that growth could cool further with sales potentially even declining versus current levels in the medium term. Here’s why. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. However, the AI landscape may be shifting. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger in terms of several parameters. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck as much of the Internet’s high-quality data is already run through large language models. Considering this, the considerably front-loaded AI training phase could wind down. The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments yet. As shareholders eventually seek better returns, we could see capital spending on GPU chips cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The long-term focus of AI will be on inference, where trained models are used in real-world applications. This phase is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors that are less powerful. To be sure, Nvidia may well remain the leader by far in inferencing as well, but there’s certainly an opening for rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain market share with chips such as AMD’s MI300 chips or Intel’s Gaudi AI accelerators. Nvidia’s top-end chips such as the H100 might be considered as overkill for simpler inference tasks, considering their high power consumption and upfront cost. There are signs that the big supply-demand mismatch seen through the early phase of the generative AI wave is easing. Microsoft which is Nvidia’s largest customer for GPUs, recently indicated that it was no longer supply-constrained for GPUs. The fact that Nvidia’s largest customer has sufficient chips to run its AI efforts suggests that the frantic “fear-of-missing-out” phase of GPU demand may be well behind us. Moreover, if demand stabilizes due to the above factors just as supply catches up, Nvidia may face pricing pressures or slower sales growth particularly if large customers rethink their inventory requirements. Now Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this year (FY’25) to about $129 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 10% over the next two years, due to the factors above, revenue could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to just about $165 billion in FY’27. Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY’19 to about 49% in FY’24 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for Nvidia’s net income change. However, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, big tech players like Google - who are Nvidia’s biggest customers - are doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. Competition will make Nvidia’s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable. Earlier this month, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. Amazon is also marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that it uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as searching. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business and margins. Should you Sell Nvidia and buy Intel Stock? The gains from NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and potential changes in the AI landscape, what’s the downside for Nvidia stock? If we combine about 1.2x revenue growth (up 20%) between FY’25 and FY’27, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30% from current levels, or 0.7x), this would imply that net income could decline by about 15% by 2027. Now if earnings shrink by 15%, the P/E multiple is bound to take a hit as investors re-assess Nvidia’s position as a growth stock. Moreover, changes to U.S. monetary policy could also impact high multiple tech stocks to an extent. During its meeting earlier this week, the Central bankers signaled a slower pace of rate cuts ahead. Policymakers reduced the number of quarter-point cuts they expected for 2025, from an average of four back in September to just two presently. This could be a sign that the era of very low interest rates seen through Covid-19 is behind us. If Nvidia’s P/E gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 44x now to about 25x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock to about $65 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3 - if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia’s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a sizable correction.

Title: How innovation died at Intel: America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer faces an uncertain future and lawsuits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel's (INTC) fall from grace seemed to happen all at once. Shares of the once iconic chipmaker plummeted 60% in 2024. The company posted the biggest loss in its 56-year history in its latest quarterly earnings report. Its market cap has dropped 80% since 2000 — when it was one of the most valuable companies in the world. In November, an ascendant Nvidia (NVDA) replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A month later, CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned after taking the helm in February 2021. And on Wednesday the company was hit with yet another lawsuit filed by shareholders — this time seeking damages related to substantial losses from its struggling foundry division. But company insiders and industry analysts tell Yahoo Finance that Intel's dramatic crash is the result of a slow deterioration spanning more than two decades. “They had a God complex; they were super arrogant,” a former high-level executive who worked at Intel for more than 20 years told Yahoo Finance. “They felt like they had such a large competitive advantage that they could never do anything wrong.” The cause of Intel’s decay? A culture of complacency, short-term thinking, and lack of execution, all while its rivals got better. Today, Intel is hemorrhaging share in the very market it created, losing customers to AMD (AMD), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance. The x86 architecture underpinning Intel and AMD's products is, in turn, losing share to British chip designer Arm (ARM), according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Those chips altogether — CPUs, or central processing units — are existentially threatened by the rise of AI-focused GPUs, or graphics processing units, a market dominated by Nvidia. And its fledgling foundry business is bleeding cash while competitors snatch fat contracts leveraging machine technology that Intel once funded. In 2024, Nvidia's stock is up 173%, while Arm, Broadcom (AVGO), and TSMC (TSM) clocked 93%, 101%, and 92% gains, respectively. Yahoo Finance spoke with half a dozen Wall Street analysts and experts and more than a dozen current and former employees (including high-level executives who were at the company for over a decade) for an inside look at Intel's failures and its future as America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. The employees were granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Intel spokesperson said, "We are executing with rigor on our plan to rebuild product and process leadership and improve our profitability. The work we are doing to strengthen our product portfolio, combined with our disciplined focus on driving returns on our foundry investments, supports our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable financial performance and unlock shareholder value.” As the rise of Arm-based chips and AI GPUs eroded Intel's standing, Pat Gelsinger promised to turn things around by launching a foundry business — leveraging Intel's manufacturing capabilities to make chips for external customers. The move was intended to bring back bold, innovative thinking — a "Grovian" mindset, referring to its famed former CEO Andy Grove. Some say it was Gelsinger’s best bet. “I think it's the right move because without looking outside the company and pursuing external customers, it's a shrinking company,” Hari said. Others were skeptical of the approach. Multiple analysts and insiders said the decline of Intel’s product business handcuffed its ability to fund Gelsinger’s aggressive capital spending and hiring sprees — which gave way to layoffs that depressed morale. Several employees commended what they described as Gelsinger’s brilliance and good character: One posted on LinkedIn about Gelsinger helping his grandson access medications to treat a fatal genetic disease. Others contended that Gelsinger set expectations too high, then acted more as a cheerleader than executor and refused to listen to input that didn’t align with his vision. Gelsinger’s stated target when he became CEO was to have Intel’s foundry generating $15 billion in revenue by 2030 — roughly double the $8.5 billion Samsung generated last year after nearly two decades of operation, according to Gartner data cited by Rasgon. In its most recent quarter, Intel’s net loss totaled $16.6 billion due to substantial losses in its chip manufacturing division. “Intel has not demonstrated that they can execute on foundry … because they don't have a track record and the track record that you've seen from their internal execution has been so flawed,” KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. “It's hard for anyone to commit any major mission-critical applications for them. And as a result of that, Intel is not going to pick up any sort of meaningful business.” Its last hope to right a sinking ship has been called into question. Under Gelsinger, Intel staked its fate on a new advanced manufacturing process called 18A — which the company’s corporate vice president Bruce Andrews told the Financial Times in November would “bring [the company] back to technological leadership.” The process would allow Intel to manufacture the most advanced AI chips with tiny components tens of thousands of times smaller than the size of a human body cell. Intel initially said it would begin high-volume production with its 18A process in the first half of 2025, then moved that target to the second half of next year, according to its third quarter earnings call. Internal testing of 18A earlier this year reportedly showed it wasn’t ready for high-volume production. A current employee at one of Intel’s fabs told Yahoo Finance there are “a lot of issues” making chips with the 18A process. They said that Intel is not ready to take on external customers and that communications between teams that should take days often take weeks as employees avoid responsibility for mishaps. Intel declined a request to comment on 18A, but pointed to recent commentary from its temporary co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus stating that 18A is on track to roll out by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, Intel has already purchased at least $760 million worth of machinery for its successor manufacturing process to 18A, called 14A. Gelsinger was ousted on Dec. 1 by Intel’s board, which has been criticized as “extremely weak” and lacking “hardened semiconductor people” by sources Yahoo Finance spoke to. Notably, the board added two leading semiconductor experts days after Gelsinger's exit. Intel’s technology is, in large part, responsible for the digital revolution. Its co-founder Bob Noyce has the greatest claim to the founding of Silicon Valley, according to semiconductor expert Chris Miller, author of “Chip War.” The company invented the world’s first microprocessors (i.e. computer chips) and the x86 architecture (a critical blueprint for designing computer chips). Its other co-founder, Gordon Moore, created “Moore’s Law,” a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. But after the dot-com bust, Intel invested in multiple projects that never materialized or failed to reach their potential. Two former executives told Yahoo Finance that innovative efforts were often killed if they didn't immediately contribute to revenue or risked cannibalizing existing products. One former high-level executive, who worked within several divisions, said Intel didn't support the team working on low-power Atom chips for mobile phones in the early 2000s. It sold its license for Xscale, then Arm's most advanced architecture for mobile chips, to Marvell (MRVL) in 2006. Paul Otellini, who served as CEO from 2005 to 2013, also passed on making chips for the initial Apple iPhone. Instead, Intel bet on Nokia — “a spectacular failure in terms of strategic decision making,” a former executive said. Its manufacturing division opted to use a technique called multiple patterning rather than investing in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines, which use incredibly complex technology from Dutch company ASML (ASML) that was only made possible by funding from Intel in the late 1990s and early 2000s. TSMC and Samsung (005930.KS) successfully adopted EUV lithography first, vital to today's advanced chipmaking. Meanwhile, a former high-level executive said Intel had 10 EUV machines worth more than $1 billion in 2019 that it wasn't fully utilizing. Six former executives pointed to poor leadership as the source of many problems. They said Gelsinger's predecessors Brian Krzanich (known as “BK”) and Bob Swan prioritized short-term thinking over long-term technology strategies. The two served from 2013 to 2018 and 2018 to 2021, respectively. Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, it scrapped a project codenamed Larrabee, led by then-chief technology officer Gelsinger, which aimed to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD’s graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU. Three former executives say Koduri had a strong vision but was weak on execution. Koduri told Yahoo Finance, "As member of executive leadership team, I did bear the accountability of overall execution. Being criticized given my responsibility is true but, given the factors at play, is unkind to the engineering team that executed against all odds." At the same time, Intel acquired Habana Labs to develop another type of AI chip called an ASIC accelerator. But the effort wasn't prioritized due to internal politics, according to an executive who helped oversee the acquisition. “Their focus on Nvidia, who is the real enemy, was simply not there,” the source said. “They were like …crabs fighting amongst themselves.” To add insult to injury, Intel missed opportunities to acquire Nvidia and invest in OpenAI. Meanwhile, rivals were improving rapidly. TSMC began manufacturing iPhone chips in 2014, and Apple ditched Intel after creating its own MacBook chips using Arm's architecture. Nvidia spent nearly two decades developing the technology used in its AI chips before they took off in earnest. ASML spent 17 years creating its EUV lithography systems that gave it an effective monopoly over the tech required to make Nvidia chips. By the time generative AI sparked a new era of tech boom, Intel had been left in the dust. Chipmaking is becoming an increasingly important national security issue as US-China relations deteriorate. The US government is betting on Intel, sinking nearly $8 billion in CHIPS Act funding into the company’s existing and future foundries. But the money adds to Intel's conundrum: Its product business would be better off outsourcing all chipmaking to TSMC, Hari said, but that would leave its manufacturing division with no revenue. Analysts from Citi, KeyBanc, Raymond James, and others say Intel should spin off or divest its foundry business, but it has to maintain a 50.1% stake to keep its CHIPS Act funding. “There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the [CEO] slot looks in for a tough ride,” Rasgon wrote in a client note. Intel's revenue for the upcoming quarter is expected to fall more than 10% year over year to $13.8 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, and earnings per share are projected to drop 77% to $0.12. The company named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs, with Holthaus heading the newly formed Intel Products division. Two former high-level executives critiqued the move, with one saying Holthaus has "no technical skill." " To put these co-CEOs in shows you they had no succession plan," Rasgon told Yahoo Finance. He said the CEO " everybody wants" to see is Lip-Bu Tan, the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, who is reportedly a candidate. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization. Zinsner and Holthaus did not respond to Yahoo Finance's requests for comment. During UBS's Technology and AI Conference in Arizona on Dec. 4, Zinsner said Intel remains committed to its foundry business. " [We] still want to be a world-class foundry, want to be the western provider of leading-edge silicon to customers," he said. One former executive said the best pick for Intel's permanent CEO should be a " hardcore" chips expert who understands the technology. Another agreed — but indicated the person needs to be an outsider. "Nobody in the Intel Technology Development Group, who's either at the top level or one level down, would even have a seat at the table anywhere in the first three levels of management at TSMC," said the former executive who worked in Intel's foundry. While the government is funding the expansion of TSMC’s and Samsung’s foundries in the US, the vast majority of those companies’ manufacturing capacity is in their home countries of Taiwan and South Korea, per Miller. That's seen by some as a national security risk in case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. But "that doesn't automatically make Intel the solution," Rasgon said. " We can throw all the money we want at Intel, it doesn't necessarily fix the problem," he added. Nearly 80% of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance, including Rasgon, have a Hold rating on the stock, with an average price target of $24 over the next 12 months. "I don't envy the new CEO," one former executive said. "How many leading-edge silicon providers can the world afford? Is it two or is it three? If it's three, then you'd say, 'OK, as long as they get their manufacturing technology up, it'll be OK.' If it's two, then ... who's going to die as a foundry, Intel or Samsung?"

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel's (INTC) fall from grace seemed to happen all at once. Shares of the once iconic chipmaker plummeted 60% in 2024. The company posted the biggest loss in its 56-year history in its latest quarterly earnings report. Its market cap has dropped 80% since 2000 — when it was one of the most valuable companies in the world. In November, an ascendant Nvidia (NVDA) replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A month later, CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned after taking the helm in February 2021. And on Wednesday the company was hit with yet another lawsuit filed by shareholders — this time seeking damages related to substantial losses from its struggling foundry division. But company insiders and industry analysts tell Yahoo Finance that Intel's dramatic crash is the result of a slow deterioration spanning more than two decades. “They had a God complex; they were super arrogant,” a former high-level executive who worked at Intel for more than 20 years told Yahoo Finance. “They felt like they had such a large competitive advantage that they could never do anything wrong.” The cause of Intel’s decay? A culture of complacency, short-term thinking, and lack of execution, all while its rivals got better. Today, Intel is hemorrhaging share in the very market it created, losing customers to AMD (AMD), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance. The x86 architecture underpinning Intel and AMD's products is, in turn, losing share to British chip designer Arm (ARM), according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Those chips altogether — CPUs, or central processing units — are existentially threatened by the rise of AI-focused GPUs, or graphics processing units, a market dominated by Nvidia. And its fledgling foundry business is bleeding cash while competitors snatch fat contracts leveraging machine technology that Intel once funded. In 2024, Nvidia's stock is up 173%, while Arm, Broadcom (AVGO), and TSMC (TSM) clocked 93%, 101%, and 92% gains, respectively. Yahoo Finance spoke with half a dozen Wall Street analysts and experts and more than a dozen current and former employees (including high-level executives who were at the company for over a decade) for an inside look at Intel's failures and its future as America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. The employees were granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Intel spokesperson said, "We are executing with rigor on our plan to rebuild product and process leadership and improve our profitability. The work we are doing to strengthen our product portfolio, combined with our disciplined focus on driving returns on our foundry investments, supports our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable financial performance and unlock shareholder value.” As the rise of Arm-based chips and AI GPUs eroded Intel's standing, Pat Gelsinger promised to turn things around by launching a foundry business — leveraging Intel's manufacturing capabilities to make chips for external customers. The move was intended to bring back bold, innovative thinking — a "Grovian" mindset, referring to its famed former CEO Andy Grove. Some say it was Gelsinger’s best bet. “I think it's the right move because without looking outside the company and pursuing external customers, it's a shrinking company,” Hari said. Others were skeptical of the approach. Multiple analysts and insiders said the decline of Intel’s product business handcuffed its ability to fund Gelsinger’s aggressive capital spending and hiring sprees — which gave way to layoffs that depressed morale. Several employees commended what they described as Gelsinger’s brilliance and good character: One posted on LinkedIn about Gelsinger helping his grandson access medications to treat a fatal genetic disease. Others contended that Gelsinger set expectations too high, then acted more as a cheerleader than executor and refused to listen to input that didn’t align with his vision. Gelsinger’s stated target when he became CEO was to have Intel’s foundry generating $15 billion in revenue by 2030 — roughly double the $8.5 billion Samsung generated last year after nearly two decades of operation, according to Gartner data cited by Rasgon. In its most recent quarter, Intel’s net loss totaled $16.6 billion due to substantial losses in its chip manufacturing division. “Intel has not demonstrated that they can execute on foundry … because they don't have a track record and the track record that you've seen from their internal execution has been so flawed,” KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. “It's hard for anyone to commit any major mission-critical applications for them. And as a result of that, Intel is not going to pick up any sort of meaningful business.” Its last hope to right a sinking ship has been called into question. Under Gelsinger, Intel staked its fate on a new advanced manufacturing process called 18A — which the company’s corporate vice president Bruce Andrews told the Financial Times in November would “bring [the company] back to technological leadership.” The process would allow Intel to manufacture the most advanced AI chips with tiny components tens of thousands of times smaller than the size of a human body cell. Intel initially said it would begin high-volume production with its 18A process in the first half of 2025, then moved that target to the second half of next year, according to its third quarter earnings call. Internal testing of 18A earlier this year reportedly showed it wasn’t ready for high-volume production. A current employee at one of Intel’s fabs told Yahoo Finance there are “a lot of issues” making chips with the 18A process. They said that Intel is not ready to take on external customers and that communications between teams that should take days often take weeks as employees avoid responsibility for mishaps. Intel declined a request to comment on 18A, but pointed to recent commentary from its temporary co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus stating that 18A is on track to roll out by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, Intel has already purchased at least $760 million worth of machinery for its successor manufacturing process to 18A, called 14A. Gelsinger was ousted on Dec. 1 by Intel’s board, which has been criticized as “extremely weak” and lacking “hardened semiconductor people” by sources Yahoo Finance spoke to. Notably, the board added two leading semiconductor experts days after Gelsinger's exit. Intel’s technology is, in large part, responsible for the digital revolution. Its co-founder Bob Noyce has the greatest claim to the founding of Silicon Valley, according to semiconductor expert Chris Miller, author of “Chip War.” The company invented the world’s first microprocessors (i.e. computer chips) and the x86 architecture (a critical blueprint for designing computer chips). Its other co-founder, Gordon Moore, created “Moore’s Law,” a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. But after the dot-com bust, Intel invested in multiple projects that never materialized or failed to reach their potential. Two former executives told Yahoo Finance that innovative efforts were often killed if they didn't immediately contribute to revenue or risked cannibalizing existing products. One former high-level executive, who worked within several divisions, said Intel didn't support the team working on low-power Atom chips for mobile phones in the early 2000s. It sold its license for Xscale, then Arm's most advanced architecture for mobile chips, to Marvell (MRVL) in 2006. Paul Otellini, who served as CEO from 2005 to 2013, also passed on making chips for the initial Apple iPhone. Instead, Intel bet on Nokia — “a spectacular failure in terms of strategic decision making,” a former executive said. Its manufacturing division opted to use a technique called multiple patterning rather than investing in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines, which use incredibly complex technology from Dutch company ASML (ASML) that was only made possible by funding from Intel in the late 1990s and early 2000s. TSMC and Samsung (005930.KS) successfully adopted EUV lithography first, vital to today's advanced chipmaking. Meanwhile, a former high-level executive said Intel had 10 EUV machines worth more than $1 billion in 2019 that it wasn't fully utilizing. Six former executives pointed to poor leadership as the source of many problems. They said Gelsinger's predecessors Brian Krzanich (known as “BK”) and Bob Swan prioritized short-term thinking over long-term technology strategies. The two served from 2013 to 2018 and 2018 to 2021, respectively. Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, it scrapped a project codenamed Larrabee, led by then-chief technology officer Gelsinger, which aimed to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD’s graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU. Three former executives say Koduri had a strong vision but was weak on execution. Koduri told Yahoo Finance, "As member of executive leadership team, I did bear the accountability of overall execution. Being criticized given my responsibility is true but, given the factors at play, is unkind to the engineering team that executed against all odds." At the same time, Intel acquired Habana Labs to develop another type of AI chip called an ASIC accelerator. But the effort wasn't prioritized due to internal politics, according to an executive who helped oversee the acquisition. “Their focus on Nvidia, who is the real enemy, was simply not there,” the source said. “They were like …crabs fighting amongst themselves.” To add insult to injury, Intel missed opportunities to acquire Nvidia and invest in OpenAI. Meanwhile, rivals were improving rapidly. TSMC began manufacturing iPhone chips in 2014, and Apple ditched Intel after creating its own MacBook chips using Arm's architecture. Nvidia spent nearly two decades developing the technology used in its AI chips before they took off in earnest. ASML spent 17 years creating its EUV lithography systems that gave it an effective monopoly over the tech required to make Nvidia chips. By the time generative AI sparked a new era of tech boom, Intel had been left in the dust. Chipmaking is becoming an increasingly important national security issue as US-China relations deteriorate. The US government is betting on Intel, sinking nearly $8 billion in CHIPS Act funding into the company’s existing and future foundries. But the money adds to Intel's conundrum: Its product business would be better off outsourcing all chipmaking to TSMC, Hari said, but that would leave its manufacturing division with no revenue. Analysts from Citi, KeyBanc, Raymond James, and others say Intel should spin off or divest its foundry business, but it has to maintain a 50.1% stake to keep its CHIPS Act funding. “There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the [CEO] slot looks in for a tough ride,” Rasgon wrote in a client note. Intel's revenue for the upcoming quarter is expected to fall more than 10% year over year to $13.8 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, and earnings per share are projected to drop 77% to $0.12.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session.

The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: CagriSema demonstrates superior weight loss in adults with obesity or overweight in the REDEFINE 1 trial

December 20, 2024 05:41 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from REDEFINE 1, a phase 3 trial in the global REDEFINE programme. REDEFINE 1 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to the individual components cagrilintide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, all administered once-weekly. The trial included 3,417 randomised people with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and a mean baseline body weight of 106.9 kg. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo. The REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg. When evaluating the effects of treatment if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks compared to a reduction of 11.8% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.1% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 2.3% with placebo alone. In addition, 40.4% of patients who received CagriSema reached a weight loss of 25% or more after 68 weeks, compared to 6.0% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 16.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 0.9% with placebo. When applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 20.4% compared to a reduction of 11.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg, 14.9% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and 3.0% with placebo. In the trial, CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. “We are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema demonstrating superiority over both semaglutide and cagrilintide in monotherapy in the REDEFINE 1 trial. This was achieved even though only 57% of patients reached the highest CagriSema dose,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema.” The results from the second pivotal phase 3 trial, REDEFINE 2, in adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight are expected during the first half of 2025. About CagriSemaOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby help people eat less and reduce their calorie intake. About the REDEFINE clinical trial programmeREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. Additional phase 3 trials are ongoing. REDEFINE 1 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,400 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 2 – a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 1,200 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight. REDEFINE 3 – an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes. REDEFINE 4 – a 72-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema versus once-weekly tirzepatide 15 mg in 800 adults with obesity.

Title: How Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lost its glow amid layoffs and pivots
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-layoffs-restructuring-pivots-struggling-celebrity-brand-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-20T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Gwyneth Paltrow took a measured tone earlier this year when she discussed Goop, her newsletter turned e-commerce company, onstage at a Forbes event. She didn't brag about the nine figures the brand had raised or its latest product release. Instead, she said she was proud Goop was still in business. "Some years we're down, then we're back up," she said. "I'm proud that we're still alive and kicking." That might seem surprising for a company that was valued at $433 million in 2020 and was a trailblazer for what a celebrity brand could be. But it's reflective of a company that — despite its name recognition and pop-culture footprint — has undergone several painful pivots in recent years. In September, Goop laid off nearly 20% of its staff, including its chief technology officer and its vice president of content. A few weeks later, it laid off about 6% of the remaining employees. Goop's recent cuts come as the company shifts focus to its beauty, fashion, and food businesses. It's the latest in a series of strategy changes over the past several years. Changes in focus are normal for a startup. Still, after 16 years of existence, the company isn't profitable and continues to struggle to build a firm foundation apart from Paltrow. The company's once buzzy supplement regimens generated $100,000 in sales on the day they launched in 2017. Now, only one of the four initial regimens is still offered online, and for a discount. A Goop spokesperson told Business Insider that any new supplements it launched would be part of its beauty business. Julia Hunter, a Goop board member and the former CEO of Jenni Kayne, addressed some of the company's struggles in an interview with Puck, published after BI sent Goop a series of questions for this story. "The company is doing very well from a revenue perspective, butoperating expenses have continued to grow," Hunter said. "I know that it's unpopular to let people go, but they hired a lot of people that they probably shouldn't have." On the content side, Goop has recently cut many editorial positions, including the vice president of content, the head beauty editor, and several other editors. A review of Goop's website shows few new articles, and its book imprint hasn't published a new release in over a year. The magazine ran two issues before folding, and while there were reports that Goop's Netflix series, "The Goop Lab," was renewed, it hasn't materialized. Paltrow's importance to the brand is evident in product launches, two former Goop employees told BI. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation; their identities are known to BI. When she's part of a launch campaign, Goop calls it an "A launch," and the performance of the advertising on social media "quadruples," one of the former employees said. Performance often drops off once she's no longer involved, this person added. Last month, a video featuring Paltrow that promoted Goop's newest release, a retinol serum, drew 1,100 likes on Instagram. The next day, a second post about the serum — which didn't include Paltrow — got fewer than 275 likes. "Brands need to find viable business models, rather than simply a celebrity face," Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital, said of A-list entrepreneurs. The celebrity brands that have grown to be the largest — like Kim Kardashian's Skims, Rihanna's Fenty, and Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty — have moved beyond their founder's image. Skims, which is valued at $4 billion, has made using models from popular culture a core part of its marketing strategy, for instance. Goop's founding story has become lore to a certain type of aspirant. In 2008, Paltrow was sitting in the kitchen of the London house she shared with her then-husband, Chris Martin, when she decided to write a newsletter for "family, friends, and friends of friends." The issue featured a recipe for banana muffins and photos shot on Paltrow's BlackBerry. "It was one of the first of its kind to leverage a curated lifestyle of a celebrity," Stacy Jones, the CEO of the branding agency Hollywood Branded, told BI. "It is aligned to her own personal brand in a very unique way that hadn't been done to that extent before." Before long, Paltrow was earning small checks from advertisers and began dreaming of a media empire. Paltrow hired media veterans from Meredith and Condé Nast to run the publication. There was a lifestyle website with travel guides and interviews on alternative medicine. Paltrow launched a publishing imprint, Goop Press, in 2015 and a magazine in partnership with Condé Nast in 2017. Conferences promised to be the next big thing for the brand when the In Goop Health Summit series kicked off in 2017, offering (mainly) women the promise of looking and feeling like Paltrow for the four-figure ticket price. In 2020, as streaming entered its golden age, she scored a deal with Netflix. But Goop suffered in recent years amid a broader digital media downturn. "Advertising business as a big part of revenue started to decline, and that was probably the biggest shift to revenue of the last several years," Hunter told Puck, adding that going forward, editorial would be "integrated with social media." Paltrow still posts regular episodes of the Goop podcast, and after a few years off because of the pandemic, the In Goop Health Summit returned last year. That said, Goop's media projects appear to have been largely shut down, as many of the staffers behind them were affected by the recent cuts. As Goop's media initiatives fell short, its e-commerce ambitions — or what the company dubbed "contextual commerce" — took center stage. The core of its e-commerce business has ebbed and flowed over the years. First, it pushed skincare, then fashion, then wellness. Now, it's back to beauty and fashion. "It's a lot of testing" of different verticals, the second former employee said. In May, Goop brought in outside consultants, led by Hunter, to help streamline the organization and reduce payroll. Then, in September, Goop announced its latest pivot, saying it would double down on fashion, beauty, and food. These aren't new initiatives for Goop, but the company has touted their recent growth. G. Label, the company's in-house clothing line, launched in 2016. The company told BI that the brand's sales were up 45% this year compared with the same period last year, but it declined to share the revenue numbers. The two former employees said they felt G. Label had historically underperformed partly because it was initially designed to fit Paltrow, who, at a slender 5-foot-9, has a much different figure from that of the average American woman. "We were just putting together whatever Gwyneth felt like wearing," the first former employee said. They added that the company revised the line in the past year using a new, standard-fit model, which they said had helped its sales. The Goop spokesperson said a new designer had been hired for G. Label in the past year and revamped the line. Goop's first foray into beauty was also in 2016. A few of the products have repeat customers — the neck peptide serum is a top seller — but there isn't a breakthrough hero product. Some recent efforts to expand the beauty offerings haven't taken off. Last year, the company launched Good Clean Goop, a moderately priced line, in Target and Amazon. Since then, the company has discounted a number of the brand's products, including the Daily Juice Cleanser and the Healthy Aging Serum. Puck reported in June that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target. The brand has not posted on social media in more than a month. The two former employees said Goop's contract with Target would end at the beginning of next year. Then there's Goop Kitchen, the "food" piece, which is not part of the core company. The Goop spokesperson said Goop Kitchen was set up as a joint venture and called it a "separate commercial entity." They declined to share what ownership stake Goop has, if any. Goop has publicly touted growth statistics — like a 25% sales increase for Goop Beauty and a 45% increase for G. Label. The former employees said these figures were driven in part by an influx of paid ad spend. The Goop spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is profitable. Hunter told Puck it wasn't. Whether Goop's latest efforts to boost revenue and cut back on staff are enough to turn the company around remains to be seen. Paltrow, for her part, has hinted that she wants Goop to thrive without her. "I don't think I can have this job forever," she told The New York Times last year. "I think it would be nice to return my investors' money, and I really want to do that. That's important to me." Jump to

Captioned Krivenok v. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz, No. 24-cv-10926 (C.D. Cal.), the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit charges Kaspi.kz and certain of Kaspi.kz’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-joint-stock-company-kaspi-kz-class-action-lawsuit-kspi.html You can also contact attorneys J.C.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: Kaspi.kz provides payments, marketplace, and fintech solutions for consumers and merchants in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing Kaspi.kz to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (ii) Kaspi.kz engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; and (iii) certain of Kaspi.kz’s executives have links to reputed criminals. The Kaspi.kz class action lawsuit further alleges that on September 19, 2024, Culper Research issued a report entitled “Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money for Criminals and Kleptocrats.” On this news, the price of Kaspi.kz American depositary shares fell nearly 19% over two trading sessions, according to the complaint.

TORONTO, Dec. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. today announced the estimated annual capital gains distributions for the Vanguard ETFs listed below for the 2024 tax year. This is an update to the estimated annual capital gains distributions announced on November 18, 2024. Please note that these are estimated amounts only, as of December 15, 2024, and could change if the Vanguard ETFs experience subscriptions or redemptions prior to the ex-dividend date. These estimates are for the year-end capital gains distributions only, which will be re-invested and the resulting units immediately consolidated, so that the number of units held by each investor will not change. These estimates do not include estimates of ongoing monthly or quarterly cash distribution amounts, which are reported in a separate press release. The ex-dividend date for the 2024 year-end distributions for these ETFs will be December 30, 2024. The record date will be December 30, 2024 and payable on January 7, 2025. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested capital gains distributions for 2024, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.) in early-2025.

Title: 7 Growth Stocks To Buy In 2025

getty If increasing net worth is on your list of 2025 resolutions, re-evaluating your growth stock portfolio may be the first action item. You can fill the gaps with companies that have proven growth track records and strong outlooks. Seven promising stocks to consider are introduced below. Growth stocks are equity shares likely to outperform their peers and the broader market. Outperformance can happen when a company successfully delivers an innovative solution to a sizable audience. Companies that unlock this growth puzzle tend to keep doing it. To be clear, past growth performance does not guarantee future success. But it does show a leadership team's ability to see big opportunities, implement solutions and create value. For that reason, my screening criteria for growth stocks includes historic growth metrics and future performance expectations: Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. The table below shows seven top growth stocks that meet the above parameters. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Let's take a closer look at each of these fast-growing companies. Data comes from company reports and Stockanalysis.com. Eli Lilly is a drugmaker offering treatments for diabetes, weight loss, plaque psoriasis, anxiety, fibromyalgia and other conditions. Eli Lilly has business momentum, thanks to Mounjaro and Zepbound, two formulations that treat diabetes and obesity, respectively. Both drugs are versions of the compound tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. GLP-1 drugs have been popular since competing product Ozempic became the weight-loss answer for Hollywood A-listers. Ozempic is technically a diabetes medication, but its maker Novo Nordisk markets a related product called Wegovy for weight loss. Demand for Ozempic, Wegovy and the Eli Lilly treatments have outpaced supply, causing shortages in the U.S. Lilly is addressing the shortage by investing billions in production capacity. The company has also completed clinical trials showing its Zepbound treatment is more effective for weight loss than Wegovy. Since 2020, LLY's EPS has varied from $5.80 to $6.90. Analysts expect 2024 and 2025 EPS of $13.32 and $22.24, respectively. ServiceNow offers a workflow automation platform for enterprise technology management. The platform is sold on a subscription basis to Fortune 500 companies and others. In the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow had subscription growth of 22.5%—beating the high end of the company's guidance. Customers are responding well to ServiceNow's AI-focused messaging. The company is positioning its Now platform as an essential AI-powered resource for digital transformation. The company's investments in efficiency-enhancing generative AI features are also paying off. Examples include industry-targeted AI solutions for financial services, telecommunications and more. ServiceNow is also incorporating agenic AI into its platform. Agenic AI is an emerging AI innovation that can complete complex tasks, learn and make decisions without human intervention. Analysts expect NOW to produce 2024 and 2025 EPS of $14.06 and $16.87, respectively. The company delivered $8.42 in EPS in 2023 and $1.60 in 2022. Shopify manages and sells a commerce platform that customers use to manage inventory and sell products online and offline. Shopify generates about $8 billion in annual revenue with a leading 28% market share in the e-commerce platform segment. Like ServiceNow, Shopify invests continually in platform features to enhance efficiency and productivity for customers. In Shopify's case, the customers range from solo entrepreneurs to big brands. Recent enhancements include the launch of generative AI to respond to customer queries and the expansion of sales tax management to the entire EU. The company has a great growth track record, expanding sales from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $7 billion last year. Analysts expect EPS of $1.29 in 2024 and $1.54 in 2025, both sizable upticks from the $0.10 earned in 2023.

MercadoLibre manages the top e-commerce marketplace and one of the largest online payment platforms in Latin America. MELI is often called the "Amazon of South America." Both companies operate dominant e-commerce marketplaces in their regions and have delivered strong returns to shareholders for a decade. MercadoLibre does not have a cloud computing business like Amazon, but it does have a popular digital payment solution, Mercado Pago. Between 2019 and 2023, MercadoLibre grew annual revenues from $2.2 billion to more than $14.4 billion. The bottom line increased from a $3.71 loss per share to earnings of $19.47 per share, with steady operating margin growth along the way. Analysts expect the growth pattern to continue. Strengthening economic conditions in Argentina is one reason for optimism. MercadoLibre has a strong position there in e-commerce and payments, with no formidable competitors. The 2024 and 2025 EPS predictions for MELI are $36.10 and $47.92, respectively. Monolithic Power Systems designs and sells power circuits that control voltage to servers, AI and storage applications, vehicle components, home appliances, communications infrastructure and more. Monolithic has revenue exposure to three transforming industries: automotive, AI and 5G. This positioning helped the company raise its stock price from about $384 in 2021 to a high of $940 last October. However, the MPWR stock price has since dipped to the $590s. The prompt was a report speculating that Nvidia canceled its backlogged orders of a Monolithic product due to performance issues. Monolithic denied the speculations, but investors have not been convinced. The pullback may create an opportunity to buy this growing company. A Citi analyst thinks so. Analyst Kelsey Chia initiated coverage on MPWR with a buy rating and a price target of $700. Chia cited strength in AI and automotive, arguing that the opportunity available will outweigh any market share loss for Monolithic with Nvidia. Analysts expect MPWR to produce 2024 EPS of $14.35, up from $8.76 in the prior year. The 2025 EPS outlook is $16.89. Shift4 Payments provides integrated payment processing solutions to merchants in the U.S. and internationally. Shift4 Payments has steadily grown sales from $731 million in 2019 to more than $3 billion in the 12 months before September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company produced record cash flow, signed new hospitality and gaming customers, expanded geographically and raised its full-year sales and Ebitda outlooks. With strong sales, a $33 billion backlog and three acquisitions to integrate, Shift4 Payments has momentum. Acquisitions of POS companies Revel and Vectron expand the company's network of merchant customers, driving revenue and creating cross-sell opportunities. Those are a few reasons why analysts believe FOUR will produce EPS of $3.75 in 2024 and $4.71 in 2025—marking significant earnings improvement from $1.42 in 2023. Corcept Therapeutics develops treatments for metabolic, psychiatric and oncologic disorders. The company has one marketed product, a cortisol receptor blocker called Korlym. Corcept's pipeline includes Phase III and Phase IV treatments for Cushing's Syndrome and a Phase III treatment for ovarian cancer, among other things. Korlym has produced steadily growing revenue since 2019—including 48% revenue growth and 46% diluted net income per share growth in the third quarter of 2024. Conditions look good for the growth to continue. The company recently announced positive results from the treatment phase of its Catalyst study: Korlym reached its primary endpoint in patients with Cushing's Syndrome and hard-to-control type 2 diabetes. An earlier phase of Catalyst showed Cushing's is more common than previously thought. Corcept has also seen positive clinical trial results from a Phase III study of relacorilant, another treatment for Cushing's Syndrome. The EPS expectation for Corcept in 2024 is $1.39, which compares favorably to 2023 EPS of $0.94. For 2025, analysts believe the company will produce EPS of $1.79. You can wish for a prosperous new year, but strategic actions may get you there quicker. Start by reviewing your growth stock portfolio and replacing the duds with companies poised to shine in 2025.

$1 Billion Share Repurchases Completed During QuarterFull-Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Outlook RevisedFedEx Completes FedEx Freight Assessment, Will Pursue Full Separation and Create a New Publicly Traded LTL Company MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) today reported the following consolidated results for the second quarter ended November 30 (adjusted measures exclude the item listed below): Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024 As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP) As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP)Revenue $22.0 billion $22.0 billion $22.2 billion $22.2 billionOperating income $1.05 billion $1.38 billion $1.28 billion $1.42 billionOperating margin 4.8% 6.3% 5.8% 6.4%Net income $0.74 billion $0.99 billion $0.90 billion $1.01 billionDiluted EPS $3.03 $4.05 $3.55 $3.99This year's and last year's quarterly consolidated results have been adjusted for:Impact per diluted share Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024Business optimization costs $1.02 $0.44Our second quarter results demonstrate that our efforts to transform our operations are working. The Federal Express segment delivered operating profit growth despite several headwinds, including the continued weak U.S. domestic demand environment as well as the expiration of our U.S. Postal Service contract, said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. president and chief executive officer. I am proud of the team for continuing to deliver solid service to our customers throughout the Peak season, as we create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Consolidated operating results were negatively affected by lower-than-expected FedEx Freight revenue and profit, as sustained weakness in U.S. industrial production continued to pressure less-than-truckload industry demand. The lower FedEx Freight results were mostly offset by cost reduction benefits at Federal Express from DRIVE program initiatives and higher base yields at each transportation segment. Federal Express segment adjusted operating results improved during the quarter, driven by cost reduction benefits from DRIVE, higher base yield, and increased international export volume. These factors were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates, the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract for transportation services on September 29, 2024, and U.S. domestic package demand weakness. FedEx Freight segment operating results decreased during the quarter due to fewer shipments, lower fuel surcharges, and reduced weight per shipment, partially offset by higher base yield. Last year's second quarter operating income included a $30 million gain on the sale of facilities. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting second quarter results by $0.07 per diluted share. The company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during fiscal 2025, for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the company's 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on-hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion. FedEx Freight Assessment Earlier today, FedEx announced that its Board of Directors has concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company. The separation is expected to be achieved in a tax-efficient manner for FedEx stockholders and executed within the next 18 months. Additional information can be found in the related press release at investors.fedex.com. Outlook FedEx is unable to forecast the fiscal 2025 mark-to-market ("M™") retirement plans accounting adjustments. As a result, FedEx is unable to provide a fiscal 2025 earnings per share ("EPS") or effective tax rate ("ETR") outlook on a GAAP basis and is relying on the exemption provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). It is reasonably possible that the fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. FedEx is revising its fiscal 2025 revenue and earnings forecasts, and now expects:Approximately flat revenue year over year, compared to the prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase;Diluted EPS of $16.45 to $17.45 before the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments compared to the prior forecast of $17.90 to $18.90 per share; and $19.00 to $20.00 per share after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $20.00 to $21.00 per share; andETR of approximately 24.0% prior to the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, compared to the prior forecast of approximately 24.5%.FedEx is reaffirming its forecast of:Permanent cost reductions from the DRIVE transformation program of $2.2 billion; andCapital spending of $5.2 billion, with a priority on investments in network optimization and efficiency improvement, including fleet and facility modernization and automation.These forecasts assume the company's current economic forecast and fuel price expectations, successful completion of the planned stock repurchases, and no additional adverse economic or geopolitical developments. FedEx's ETR and EPS forecasts are based on current law and related regulations and guidance. I remain confident FedEx will continue to grow earnings this year despite the challenging demand environment, as we focus on transforming operations and improving revenue quality, said John Dietrich, FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. We are resolute in our strategy to prudently manage our capital expenditures, and expect to deliver on our commitment to return $3.8 billion to stockholders this fiscal year. Corporate Overview FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. With annual revenue of $87 billion, the company offers integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. Consistently ranked among the world's most admired and trusted employers, FedEx inspires its more than 500,000 employees to remain focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards and the needs of their customers and communities. FedEx is committed to connecting people and possibilities around the world responsibly and resourcefully, with a goal to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2040.

Certain statements in this press release may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, such as statements regarding expected cost savings, the optimization of our network through Network 2.0, the planned tax-free full separation of the FedEx Freight business into a new independent publicly traded company (the "FedEx Freight Separation"), future financial targets, business strategies, management's views with respect to future events and financial performance, and the assumptions underlying such expected cost savings, targets, strategies, and statements. Forward-looking statements include those preceded by, followed by or that include the words will, may, could, would, should, believes, expects, forecasts, anticipates, plans, estimates, targets, projects, intends or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and global transformation program and optimize our network through Network 2.0, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, and achieve the anticipated benefits of such strategies and actions; our ability to achieve our cost reduction initiatives and financial performance goals; the timing and amount of any costs or benefits or any specific outcome, transaction, or change (of which there can be no assurance), or the terms, timing, and structure thereof, related to our global transformation program and other ongoing reviews and initiatives; a significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure; our ability to successfully implement the FedEx Freight Separation and achieve the anticipated benefits of such transaction; damage to our reputation or loss of brand equity; our ability to remove costs related to services provided to the U.S. Postal Service ("USPS") under the contract for Federal Express Corporation to provide the USPS domestic transportation services that expired on September 29, 2024; our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; failure of third-party service providers to perform as expected, or disruptions in our relationships with those providers or their provision of services to FedEx; the effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crises; anti-trade measures and additional changes in international trade policies and relations; the effect of any international conflicts or terrorist activities, including as a result of the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; changes in fuel prices or currency exchange rates, including significant increases in fuel prices as a result of the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East and other geopolitical and regulatory developments; the effect of intense competition; our ability to match capacity to shifting volume levels; an increase in self-insurance accruals and expenses; failure to receive or collect expected insurance coverage; our ability to effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; noncash impairment charges related to our goodwill and certain deferred tax assets; the future rate of e-commerce growth; evolving or new U.S. domestic or international laws and government regulations, policies, and actions; future guidance, regulations, interpretations, challenges, or judicial decisions related to our tax positions; labor-related disruptions; legal challenges or changes related to service providers contracted to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations and the drivers providing services on their behalf and the coverage of U.S. employees at Federal Express Corporation under the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended; our ability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography; any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against litigation; our ability to achieve our goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040; and other factors which can be found in FedEx Corp.'s and its subsidiaries' press releases and FedEx Corp.'s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We do not undertake or assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The financial section of this release is provided on the company's website at investors.fedex.com.RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or reported). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including our adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated operating income and margin, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share and adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 Federal Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated and Federal Express segment non-GAAP financial measures because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. The income tax effect of the business optimization initiatives is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company's and each business segment's ongoing performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Fiscal 2025 Earnings Per Share and Effective Tax Rate Forecasts Our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments and estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives in fiscal 2025. Our fiscal 2025 ETR forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effect of fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast for the same reasons described above for historical non-GAAP measures. We are unable to predict the amount of the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, as they are significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the financial markets, so such adjustments are not included in our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts. For this reason, a full reconciliation of our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is impracticable. It is reasonably possible, however, that our fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on our fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. The table included below titled Fiscal 2025 Diluted Earnings Per Share Forecast outlines the effects of the items that are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast, other than the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or reported). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including our adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated operating income and margin, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share and adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 Federal Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated and Federal Express segment non-GAAP financial measures because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. The income tax effect of the business optimization initiatives is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company's and each business segment's ongoing performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Fiscal 2025 Earnings Per Share and Effective Tax Rate Forecasts Our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments and estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives in fiscal 2025. Our fiscal 2025 ETR forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effect of fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast for the same reasons described above for historical non-GAAP measures. We are unable to predict the amount of the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, as they are significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the financial markets, so such adjustments are not included in our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts. For this reason, a full reconciliation of our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is impracticable. It is reasonably possible, however, that our fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on our fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. The table included below titled Fiscal 2025 Diluted Earnings Per Share Forecast outlines the effects of the items that are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast, other than the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments.

Title: This Is Not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia Moment’ Yet
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/19/this-is-not-broadcoms-nvidia-moment-yet/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T21:05:23Z
Full Content:
Broadcom’s stock surged 35% in two days despite a mediocre Q4, as management offered investors a picturesque addressable market forecast for 2027. Q4 was not the blowout report the market made it out to be, as Broadcom fell just short of revenue estimates while guiding Q1 barely above consensus. Despite this, the market did solidify that momentum continues to build for AI stocks entering 2025. Broadcom’s commentary on the call as to the serviceable addressable market for its two leading AI segments, custom silicon and networking, is why the stock moved a whopping 25%. As a reminder, a serviceable addressable market refers to market size the company can service, and is not a forecast of the company’s revenue. While Broadcom gave investors a reason to dream, it’s not the stock’s ‘Nvidia moment’ despite the surge in the stock price resembling Nvidia’s 2023 breakout. Instead, Broadcom is reporting flat QoQ AI revenue with the 200% year-over-year number being old news (Broadcom had guided for $12B in AI revenue in Q3 and only marginally beat that figure). CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American developer, manufacturer, and global ... [+] supplier of semiconductor and software products, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Among the AI titans, Broadcom is the one of the only stocks to see lumpy AI growth, reporting flat AI revenue growth from Q2 to Q3 – with expectations it remains at a mere 3% QoQ growth to start fiscal 2025. This occurred roughly a month before tariffs are likely to affect its top customer – Apple. Below, I provide data that shows the move in Broadcom’s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only ~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia. When you factor in 30%+ of Broadcom’s revenue comes from China, versus Nvidia at 15% for China exposure, what you have is an upside down scenario for Broadcom where tariffs could negatively impact more revenue than what AI is currently providing. The Street is desperate to find the next Nvidia in the vast and complex sector of semiconductors and hardware providers. There were many raises/beats across AI-related semiconductors, including from many small, lesser-known names. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s report was one of the least spectacular as there was a very rare miss for Q4 revenue and a Q1 guide that was only $30 million above consensus. Growth is challenged sequentially, with Q1 only set to grow 4% QoQ. Semiconductor revenue was seen declining nearly -2% sequentially as well, with management guiding for $8.1 billion in Q1 versus $8.23 billion in Q4. AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet. What separates the two is actual, numerical data. Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter. The difference between the two is quite clear: Nvidia's sequential data center growth has totaled more than Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue in each ... [+] of the last four quarters. Broadcom has the potential to capture a large part of a rapidly growing market in AI networking and custom silicon for hyperscalers, and cement itself as the #2 in AI semiconductor stock ahead of AMD, but it requires some speculation. Broadcom has to prove that this market opportunity is theirs for the taking, and they will have to take it in full force and lay down the foundation for AI revenue to grow into that SAM – that is, to grow nearly 4x to $45 billion in AI revenue over the next three years (60% share of a $75B SAM). Broadcom’s cloud software is executing well with VMWare’s integration almost fully complete, and cost synergies and operating efficiencies being realized, but AI hardware and networking is where Broadcom needs to prove it can sustain its large market size in an environment growing fiercely competitive. For example, Arista is targeting AI networking revenue of $1.5 billion and another competitor is forecasting $2.5 billion for AI networking and custom silicon in 2025, while Nvidia’s networking revenue is well above a $12 billion annual run rate with Spectrum-X ramping. Regarding Spectrum-X, investors should take note that AI juggernaut Nvidia is entering the Ethernet market for the first time, following the success of InfiniBand. Thus, Broadcom’s lofty 70% market share is likely to come under serious pressure as Nvidia expects Spectrum-X to become a multi-billion dollar product within the next year. This boils down to valuation – Broadcom’s surge to $250, up 40% in one week, has pushed the chipmaker to trade at its first ever premium to Nvidia since its merger with Avago in 2016, and a rather large premium at that. Both of the two have strong bottom lines, but Broadcom is now trading at 35.3x NTM earnings of $6.35, whereas Nvidia is trading at 33.1x NTM earnings of $3.95. Broadcom is also trading at a slight premium on the topline, at 18.3x NTM revenue, versus 17.9x for Nvidia. Broadcom is strong on margins, though not nearly as strong as Nvidia – the operating margin of 31.9% in Q4 was slightly over half of Nvidia’s 62.3%, with a net margin of 29.8% versus Nvidia’s 55.0%. Despite the lower custom silicon revenue that needs to ramp and the highly competitive networking market, a lesser-known AI angle for Broadcom is the VMWare acquisition is paying off in spades... infrastructure software was up 196% with the acquisition now largely complete, and operating margins are an impressive 72% in this segment. Infrastructure growth was guided at 41% YoY for Q1, contributing nearly 45% of revenue, providing more robust margin tailwinds to complement AI semiconductor growth over the next couple of years. The synergies from AI-driven high-growth, high-margin infrastructure software and expectations for a rapid ramp in AI semiconductor revenue through 2027 could make Broadcom a compelling AI name, provided the price is right. Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their recent earnings report. A vertical move on heavy volume is everyone realizing at the same time the direction of the trend – shorts cover, and longs buy, causing the type of vertical price action exhibited below. These moves tend to be the 3rd waves in a 5 wave uptrend, which is what I believe AVGO just completed. There are currently two scenarios based on the price action that the I/O Fund is tracking: Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their resent ... [+] earnings report. There was significant institutional activity in the $250, $240, and $224 regions. As price is notable below these regions, it implies that institutions sold at the recent highs. If these levels contain any bounce, it will further confirm that the 3rd wave is over, which support the Blue count. If $212.50 does break, confirming this scenario, as long as the 4th wave drop holds $157, the I/O Fund would see this drop as a buying opportunity. Broadcom’s premium valuation coupled with a fraction of Nvidia’s AI revenue —- not to mention flat QoQ AI revenue growth for nearly three quarters —- is why this is not yet Broadcom’s Nvidia moment. Broadcom must now prove to the market that it can deliver on its promise and maintain its premium to the undisputed AI leader heading into 2025 with Blackwell’s fireworks show about to start. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with the I/O Fund tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet. What separates the two is actual, numerical data. Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter. The difference between the two is quite clear: Nvidia's sequential data center growth has totaled more than Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue in each ... [+] of the last four quarters. Broadcom has the potential to capture a large part of a rapidly growing market in AI networking and custom silicon for hyperscalers, and cement itself as the #2 in AI semiconductor stock ahead of AMD, but it requires some speculation. Broadcom has to prove that this market opportunity is theirs for the taking, and they will have to take it in full force and lay down the foundation for AI revenue to grow into that SAM – that is, to grow nearly 4x to $45 billion in AI revenue over the next three years (60% share of a $75B SAM). Broadcom’s cloud software is executing well with VMWare’s integration almost fully complete, and cost synergies and operating efficiencies being realized, but AI hardware and networking is where Broadcom needs to prove it can sustain its large market size in an environment growing fiercely competitive. For example, Arista is targeting AI networking revenue of $1.5 billion and another competitor is forecasting $2.5 billion for AI networking and custom silicon in 2025, while Nvidia’s networking revenue is well above a $12 billion annual run rate with Spectrum-X ramping. Regarding Spectrum-X, investors should take note that AI juggernaut Nvidia is entering the Ethernet market for the first time, following the success of InfiniBand. Thus, Broadcom’s lofty 70% market share is likely to come under serious pressure as Nvidia expects Spectrum-X to become a multi-billion dollar product within the next year. This boils down to valuation – Broadcom’s surge to $250, up 40% in one week, has pushed the chipmaker to trade at its first ever premium to Nvidia since its merger with Avago in 2016, and a rather large premium at that. Both of the two have strong bottom lines, but Broadcom is now trading at 35.3x NTM earnings of $6.35, whereas Nvidia is trading at 33.1x NTM earnings of $3.95. Broadcom is also trading at a slight premium on the topline, at 18.3x NTM revenue, versus 17.9x for Nvidia. Broadcom is strong on margins, though not nearly as strong as Nvidia – the operating margin of 31.9% in Q4 was slightly over half of Nvidia’s 62.3%, with a net margin of 29.8% versus Nvidia’s 55.0%. Despite the lower custom silicon revenue that needs to ramp and the highly competitive networking market, a lesser-known AI angle for Broadcom is the VMWare acquisition is paying off in spades... infrastructure software was up 196% with the acquisition now largely complete, and operating margins are an impressive 72% in this segment. Infrastructure growth was guided at 41% YoY for Q1, contributing nearly 45% of revenue, providing more robust margin tailwinds to complement AI semiconductor growth over the next couple of years. The synergies from AI-driven high-growth, high-margin infrastructure software and expectations for a rapid ramp in AI semiconductor revenue through 2027 could make Broadcom a compelling AI name, provided the price is right. Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their recent earnings report. A vertical move on heavy volume is everyone realizing at the same time the direction of the trend – shorts cover, and longs buy, causing the type of vertical price action exhibited below. These moves tend to be the 3rd waves in a 5 wave uptrend, which is what I believe AVGO just completed. There are currently two scenarios based on the price action that the I/O Fund is tracking: Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their resent ... [+] earnings report. There was significant institutional activity in the $250, $240, and $224 regions. As price is notable below these regions, it implies that institutions sold at the recent highs. If these levels contain any bounce, it will further confirm that the 3rd wave is over, which support the Blue count. If $212.50 does break, confirming this scenario, as long as the 4th wave drop holds $157, the I/O Fund would see this drop as a buying opportunity. Broadcom’s premium valuation coupled with a fraction of Nvidia’s AI revenue —- not to mention flat QoQ AI revenue growth for nearly three quarters —- is why this is not yet Broadcom’s Nvidia moment. Broadcom must now prove to the market that it can deliver on its promise and maintain its premium to the undisputed AI leader heading into 2025 with Blackwell’s fireworks show about to start. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with the I/O Fund tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members.

According to Philip Tong’s family, Amazon’s One Medical lacked “adequately trained and qualified staff” and was “careless, reckless and negligent.” Tong died in an emergency room hours after a One Medical telehealth provider advised him to buy an inhaler to treat symptoms including shortness of breath and coughing up blood. Share Options A California family sued Amazon-owned telehealth provider One Medical and a local hospital and physician, alleging they were “reckless and negligent” in their care of a 45-year-old man who died after seeking help via an online appointment. According to the complaint, 45-year-old Philip Tong scheduled an online appointment with Amazon One Medical on Dec. 18, 2023. Tong complained of shortness of breath and said he was coughing up blood and that his feet had turned blue. One Medical advised him to purchase an inhaler. Hours later, Tong visited the emergency room at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, where he collapsed and died. Tong’s wife, Suzanne, and his two daughters filed suit Oct. 1 in Alameda County Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Amazon One Medical, Alta Bates Summit and Dr. Aurelia A. Cheng of medical malpractice and wrongful death. The plaintiffs allege One Medical lacked “adequately trained and qualified staff” and was “careless, reckless and negligent” in its treatment of Tong, by “failing to appropriately undertake to care for or recommend care, order testing and providing proper treatment for the plaintiff.” At the time of his appointment, Tong had been sick with flu-like symptoms for about a week and was suffering from “uncontrolled diabetes, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, infection and sepsis,” according to the lawsuit. The case remained under the media’s radar until The Washington Post reported the story Wednesday. According to the Post, this “appears to be the first wrongful-death suit to be brought against One Medical, which Amazon acquired in February 2023.” The Post cited Suzanne’s remarks from her husband’s Dec. 28, 2023, funeral: “No one expected a 45-year-old man who had the flu to suddenly be dead … And to have him taken so quickly, so unexpectedly — there are no words.” The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages to be determined at trial. A hearing in the case is scheduled for March 2025. Your support helps fund this work, and CHD’s related advocacy, education and scientific research. Donate Now Training of telehealth providers ‘in its infancy’ In a statement cited by the Post, Amazon One Medical spokesperson Samantha Kruse said the company is “prohibited by law from discussing patient records.” “We care deeply about every patient we serve, and the quality and safety of our care are our highest priorities,” Kruse said. “We’re proud of our extensive quality and safety measures, and of the health outcomes we help our patients achieve. We take concerns about our care extremely seriously, and we’re committed to continuous improvement.” Legal experts told The Defender the case will come down to what the evidence will demonstrate about causation. “The timing and delay will be a factual issue and will impact causation and harm,” California-based healthcare attorney Rick Jaffe told The Defender. “The medical records, including the recording of the intake call, could sink or save both facilities.” Jaffe added: “Once a patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and recent splitting-up blood, and a diagnosis of sepsis, there’s no role for online medical care other than to say to go immediately to the ER, which is what the patient did apparently.” Pediatrician Dr. Michelle Perro told The Defender that while telehealth provides certain benefits to patients, it can’t replace physical examinations in cases like Tong’s. She said: “While clearly telehealth has many advantages in terms of increasing patient access to care, a foundational tenet of the practice of medicine is doing a thorough physical exam … Although practitioners may not be trained in telehealth, any provider should be able to realize the gravity of Mr. Tong’s reported symptoms. “Upon reviewing the health history of Mr. Tong and establishing the seriousness of his complaints, there should have been an immediate prompt to have him come in for an in-person assessment directly to an urgent care or emergency setting.” Noting the increased prevalence of telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense, told The Defender, “The ‘pandemic’ continues to degrade our quality of life.” Flores said he doesn’t oppose telehealth for routine issues. In California, physicians are still held to the same standard of care, he said. “But, in instances when, as alleged in the complaint, the deceased was simply told to take an inhaler even though he was coughing up blood, was short of breath and had blue feet, this practice of medicine becomes a travesty.” Jaffe, who suggested that telehealth is “all about triage and screening,” said there “have to be systems in place where even the telephone operators have to be trained to make quick and accurate screening of patients and moving them to an ER or urgent care center.” He said the discovery process for the lawsuit should focus on that training and those systems. “The recorded call will be very important, and perhaps the critical piece of evidence,” he said. Simon Rowland, a researcher with consumer health company Haleon and expert in telehealth and malpractice, told the Post that few telehealth providers receive special training in issuing remote diagnoses to patients. “Training in that area is in its infancy,” Rowland said. “It’s a clinical scenario that people need to understand better in terms of the risks and benefits.” For Patrick M. Wood, author of “Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse Of Global Transformation,” telehealth’s reliance on standardized protocols will hurt patient care. “Standardized protocols and ‘best practices’ will always marginalize human judgment in those cases that fall outside their scope, often with devastating consequences,” Wood told The Defender. ‘Profit motive can lead to grave errors’ According to the Post, Amazon has pushed to expand its presence in telehealth since it finalized its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in 2023. This includes efforts to combine One Medical’s services with those offered by its own telehealth service, previously known as Amazon Clinic, the Daily Mail reported. Amazon also operates an online pharmacy, Amazon Pharmacy, which arose out of its acquisition of PillPack in 2018 for $750 million, according to the Daily Mail. At a recent Amazon media event, One Medical CEO Trent Green said the company plans to increase online primary care services, including making telehealth appointments available on nights, weekends and holidays, the Post reported. “By building, testing, and scaling new models of care delivery we can help reduce costs, improve outcomes, and fundamentally transform health care,” Green said. According to the Daily Mail, One Medical has more than 800,000 members and operates over 200 medical offices in more than 20 markets. Amazon’s foray into healthcare previously encountered obstacles. According to the Daily Mail, Haven — a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase — aimed at lowering employee healthcare costs, was discontinued in 2021.

According to the Post, “As One Medical has grown under Amazon’s ownership, it has sometimes struggled to adequately care for its more vulnerable patients.” In February, Amazon One Medical announced layoffs, including of some of its clinical staff, and moved more of its patient care and communication online. The layoffs included clinical reception staff who were replaced by an Arizona-based call center. According to the Post, One Medical employees said this “put patients at risk.” In June, leaked documents revealed that Amazon One Medical staff repeatedly mishandled urgent calls from patients experiencing life-threatening symptoms. The Post reported that current and former employees have alleged “pressure to improve productivity” increased after Amazon’s purchase of One Medicine. “Virtual providers’ schedules were so tightly packed, one former employee said, that two different patients reported having telehealth visits with health-care providers who were clearly calling from their cars,” the Post reported. Jaffe said he expects “more of these cases to be filed against online companies as the telehealth model expands and more players come into the market.” Perro voiced concerns about the encroachment of non-medical organizations into healthcare. “The constant push for medical providers to see more patients and quickly make assessments driven by the profit motive can lead to grave errors.” Wood suggested that “so-called ‘evidence-based medicine’ paved the way for the technocratic takeover” of healthcare starting in the 1990s, forcing out human-based medicine. “Bad outcomes like this case are a marker of evidence-based medicine, which empowers technocrats to overuse technology at the expense of common sense.” Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D., based in Athens, Greece, is a senior reporter for The Defender and part of the rotation of hosts for CHD.TV's "Good Morning CHD."

As a first-time attendee when the Expo Floor opened, I was like a kid walking into a candy store. It was just incredible. The lights, the sounds, the noises, the people, the technology. Yeah, this is a great experience,” said Brian Crane, Founder, Crane Light & Design. “This is the conference that I go to because all of my friends are here. I was a lighting person back in the day. And this is the place that I come to see all the new technology, the new equipment. And now that I'm working more on the rigging side of things, I get a chance to come and talk about that this year,” said Kristi Ross-Clausen, Director of Education and Training, TheaterHealthandSafety.com. “LDI is a wonderful thing every year where all the vendors come together and you get an opportunity to see all of the new things out there. But, also, it's really a meeting of the minds where you get all the people who are actually creating this cutting-edge technology into one space. So, it's a great place to talk to people, pick up on what's coming up as far as ideas goes and what people have in the pipeline,” said Tyler DeLong, Managing Partner, DeLong Rigging Solutions. “LDI to me is the mecca for theater technology around the planet.

It's honestly just a great place to get together with the OGs in the industry to swap stories, meet new people, encourage the young ones today to get into the business and help it grow, because this business is growing exponentially every day,” said Tracy Nunnally, Owner, Vertigo. “This is my favorite show. Not only do a lot of our customers come here, you have end users and production companies from some of the leading companies. So, we've met so many incredible contacts here. Many touring companies have come to visit our booth, and we're really excited for them to use INFiLED with some of the top performers in the country. Such amazing contacts, just a real incredible place, and really just a fun place to be. So, I definitely recommend everyone to be at LDI,” said Larry Lipsie, Senior Sales Manager, INFiLED. “It's been a great show.

Title: Is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) the Best Growth Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An engineer in a lab coat examining a state-of-the-art semiconductor chip. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), a chip maker for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD, attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. Its advanced microprocessors have fueled business for TSMC immensely, keeping the hopes up of investors, especially after ASML cut down guidance. On October 17, TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst, Bob O’Donnell, appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss the position of TSMC. He shared that ASML cutting its guidance has more to do with challenges in China and much less with the semiconductor industry. He added that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) posted a solid financial performance, emphasizing that the company beat earnings and raised its guidance for 2025, suggesting that TSMC is a “much better bellwether” of AI. Overall, TSMC expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30% due to the growing demand for artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also plans to spend nearly $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects revenue from AI chips to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

If you’re reading this, you probably know the value of the Mercury’s news reporting, arts and culture coverage, event calendar, and the bevy of events we host throughout the year. The work we do helps our city shine, but we can’t do it without your support. If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support! GOOD MORNING, PORTLAND! 👋 Expect a cloudy, but much drier (and warmer!) day today with a steamy high of 55 degrees—aaaaaand, while we're on the subject of "steamy," don't forget to take the Mercury's SEX SURVEY! It's anonymous, so you can answer all our very probing questions with complete honesty, and in January you can read all the steamy results in our upcoming "LOVE/SEX" print issue! But in the meantime? Here's some steamy NEWS. IN LOCAL NEWS: • Controversial oil transport and storage company, Zenith Energy—you know, the one that could cause a Portland environmental catastrophe that could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster—was previously given the green light by the city to continue their clearly dangerous operations. But now? The DEQ has slammed the brakes on that process and is requiring the company to get a new air quality permit to remain in compliance with local agencies. This could afford the new, incoming city council and mayor time to put in place a new, stricter plan for Zenith—but will they? Our Taylor Griggs has the story. • Portland State University is currently struggling with what they say is a $18 million budget deficit, which is why they say they made the decision to lay off 17 non-tenure track faculty members. And while this is far less severe than their previous plan to lay off 94 workers, PSU's professors union is pointing to a financial report from an outside expert that reportedly shows that the university is in much better financial shape than they're letting on. Kevin Foster digs into the details in this interesting report. With an $18 million budget gap, Portland State University is cutting 17 academic staffers. That's less than what was anticipated in October, but PSU's professors union says an independent financial review shows stable reserves, and no need for layoffs. PSU says it's bound by accounting guidelines.⁠[image or embed] • Good news: Multnomah County's successful plan to help homeless Black people by sheltering them in a Portland motel just got a little better. The county has leased an even bigger motel—one with 65 rooms, and with a 10-year lease—in North Portland to house people of color, which will be run by the Urban League of Portland. For those naysayers who love to bitch and moan about the county at every possibility, you may want to take note of this stat: "In a one-year period from July 2023 to 2024, 55% of people exiting the shelter moved into permanent housing. Others moved into drug addiction treatment, behavioral health services or other medical programs. Only 3% returned to the street, officials said." That's progress, buddy. • More good news: The Community Cycling Center—the long running nonprofit that fixes and resells bikes to the community for cheap as well as offering bike education for kids—has found the funding it needs to stay afloat after being in danger of shutting down. When the center said it needed $349,000 to continue operating, the community was like, "We'll do you one better," and raised a whopping $389,000—$40 grand more—which will keep the good work flowing for the foreseeable future. Good work, Portlanders! 👏 Portland Thorns defender Becky Sauerbrunn, a three-time NWSL champion and a two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup winner, has announced her retirement. Read more: www.oregonlive.com/portland-tho...[image or embed] • Even MORE good news (for those who don't want to be murdered by hornets): The invasive murder hornets species, which were first spotted five years ago crossing the Canadian border into Washington state, has been eradicated in the area according to scientists. The hornets, which are very large and are known for killing 42 people and seriously injuring 1,625 in China in 2013, had slowly been making their way across the US border—but were stopped thanks to the diligence of science and neighbors who put traps in their yards. That said, researchers are remaining vigilant to ensure the little stinging fuckers don't return. Looking for the perfect vinyl gifts for those music lovers and collectors in your life? Jenni Moore just completed your list for you.www.portlandmercury.com/holiday-guid...[image or embed] IN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS: • While a plan was in the works to rescue it, the US government is now heading toward a shutdown tomorrow night after Republican cult members were swayed by billionaire dork Elon Musk and incoming orange turd Donald Trump, both of whom are pressuring their minions to torpedo the bipartisan deal. Musk tweeted over 100 times in a day in his attempt to sway congress (and their voters back home) to kill the deal, often spreading the type of bullshit misinformation that he and his fellow conspiracy theorists are so good at. Elon Musk’s congressional meddling had many Democrats referring to him as “President Musk” Wednesday—a jab sure to get under the notoriously spotlight-obsessed president-elect’s skin.[image or embed] • In another courtroom win for Trump, Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis has been disqualified from the ex-and-future president's criminal racketeering case—which could stymie the state's chances for prosecution. Willis had been accused of having an inappropriate relationship with an attorney that was hired to lead the election interference case against Trump, and while one judge had initially allowed her to continue, that decision has been overturned. The only good news? Trump's indictment trial will continue despite the defense's best efforts to have the charges dismissed. • Union members at seven Amazon distribution centers across the US have walked off the job, after claiming that the company has refused to recognize their union and enter into bargaining. While the walkout is happening during the busy Christmas delivery season, Amazon officials contend deliveries will stay on time—though may be slowed a bit in major cities. • Luigi Mangione, the suspect/internet hero indicted in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is waiving extradition and will be traveling to New York City from Philadelphia where he will face murder and terrorism charges. Mangione's attorney expects the suspect to plead not guilty. what[image or embed] • In order to calm the panicking citizens of New Jersey, the FAA is declaring a temporary ban on all drone flights over the state, which have recently been freaking out citizens and wandering into military and commercial flight paths. [I will now translate this news blurb for the aliens who are waiting off New Jersey's shore, and planning their eventual attack and enslavement of the human race: "Bleep, bleep, blorp, bloop... bleep, BLEEP, bleep, blorp, bloop."] • And finally... while a "Santa vs. Grinch" movie currently doesn't exist, IT SHOULD, and this would be a fantastic trailer for it.

Title: Micron stock plummets as weak outlook overshadows AI opportunity

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Micron stock (MU) plummeted more than 16% Thursday on weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter despite burgeoning demand for artificial intelligence chips. The memory chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA) as a major customer, said Wednesday it expects revenue between $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion for the quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to guide for revenue of $9 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Micron’s outlook points to a trend across the chip industry: Sales of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence are growing quickly, while traditional chip sales slump. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are used in Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units), which hyperscalers use in data centers to power both their customers' and their own artificial intelligence workloads. Blackwell demand is expected to soar in the upcoming year. CEO of Micron Technology Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement Wednesday that data center revenue, which includes Micron's memory chips used in GPUs, grew to more than 50% of the company's total revenue for the first time in its fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 28. Meanwhile, its “consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term." For example, Micron said that while its HBM chips revenue rose more than 50% in the November quarter, revenue from its chips for mobile phones fell 19%. Mehrotra said Micron is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy following its earnings results and outlook. Arya said Micron's growing revenue from sales of its memory chips for AI isn't enough to offset pressures from weak demand for those used in personal computers and smartphones. Analysts at investment firms, including JPMorgan, Raymond James, and TD Cowen, also lowered their price targets on the stock but kept their Buy ratings. While Micron said weak demand in the PC market is taking longer than expected to pick up, it pointed to a surging AI market opportunity for its HBM semiconductors used in AI chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Micron said it projects the market for HBM to grow to $30 billion in 2025, up from its prior forecast of $25 billion. The chipmaker sees its own HBM revenue soaring from several hundred million dollars in its fiscal year 2024 to multiple billions of dollars in 2025. “Perhaps what was most surprising is not MU's guidance, but the stock reaction AH [after the market close] given the well-understood weakness in near-term memory pricing,” TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note Thursday. Sankar reiterated his Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $125 from $135. Micron shares stood at $87 at the market close Thursday. For its fiscal first quarter, Micron's earnings per share of $1.79 surpassed the expected $1.76, while its revenue of $8.7 billion was in line with forecasts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Micron stock (MU) plummeted more than 16% Thursday on weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter despite burgeoning demand for artificial intelligence chips. The memory chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA) as a major customer, said Wednesday it expects revenue between $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion for the quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to guide for revenue of $9 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Micron’s outlook points to a trend across the chip industry: Sales of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence are growing quickly, while traditional chip sales slump. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are used in Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units), which hyperscalers use in data centers to power both their customers' and their own artificial intelligence workloads. Blackwell demand is expected to soar in the upcoming year. CEO of Micron Technology Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement Wednesday that data center revenue, which includes Micron's memory chips used in GPUs, grew to more than 50% of the company's total revenue for the first time in its fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 28. Meanwhile, its “consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term." For example, Micron said that while its HBM chips revenue rose more than 50% in the November quarter, revenue from its chips for mobile phones fell 19%. Mehrotra said Micron is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy following its earnings results and outlook. Arya said Micron's growing revenue from sales of its memory chips for AI isn't enough to offset pressures from weak demand for those used in personal computers and smartphones. Analysts at investment firms, including JPMorgan, Raymond James, and TD Cowen, also lowered their price targets on the stock but kept their Buy ratings. While Micron said weak demand in the PC market is taking longer than expected to pick up, it pointed to a surging AI market opportunity for its HBM semiconductors used in AI chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Micron said it projects the market for HBM to grow to $30 billion in 2025, up from its prior forecast of $25 billion. The chipmaker sees its own HBM revenue soaring from several hundred million dollars in its fiscal year 2024 to multiple billions of dollars in 2025. “Perhaps what was most surprising is not MU's guidance, but the stock reaction AH [after the market close] given the well-understood weakness in near-term memory pricing,” TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a note Thursday. Sankar reiterated his Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $125 from $135. Micron shares stood at $87 at the market close Thursday. For its fiscal first quarter, Micron's earnings per share of $1.79 surpassed the expected $1.76, while its revenue of $8.7 billion was in line with forecasts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

The Dow staged a rebound Thursday morning, following Wednesday’s 1,100-point plunge that marked its longest losing streak since 1974. The upturn came despite investor disappointment over the Federal Reserve’s conservative approach to rate cuts. Other major indices, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, also experienced gains after a sell-off on Wednesday afternoon. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 194 points or 0.4%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq added 0.3% each. Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 13 basis points to cross 4.50%.

Title: NVIDIA Asks Super Micro Computer (SMCI) To Investigate How Its Chips Were Illicitly Procured By China, Including The Issue Of Forged Server Serial Numbers

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We reported a few months back how NVIDIA's H100 GPUs, which remain under a strict US export control regime in relation to China, were readily accessible via Super Micro Computer's dealers within the Asian giant. Well, this issue has finally caught the attention of the authorities in the US. U.S. PROBES $NVDA CHIP SMUGGLING TO CHINA: INFORMATION The Commerce Dept has asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips ended up in China despite export restrictions, per The Information. NVIDIA instructed major distributors, including Supermicro and Dell, to conduct spot checks… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 19, 2024 To wit, The Information is now reporting that the US Commerce Department has formally asked NVIDIA to investigate how its chips that remain subject to export controls were ending up in China. For its part, NVIDIA has asked its major distributors, including Super Micro Computer and Dell, to conduct spot checks on their regional customers. NVIDIA is particularly concerned as to how some of the end-users in China were purportedly able to forge server serial numbers to circumvent the restrictions imposed under the prevailing US export controls. Back in April, our own search on Baidu had yielded a number of posts, including one which promised a large shipment of NVIDIA's H100 chips "arriving in Hong Kong in two weeks, and can be picked up in Shenzhen or Zhengzhou." Some of the posts also included data sheets bearing Super Micro Computer's logo. Similarly, a post on ZOL at the time also referenced a promotion of H100 chips from Super Micro Computer. The listing on Zol is still easily accessible but whether the GPUs are with the poster cannot be verified. Of course, this development comes as the relation between NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer appear somewhat strained. Digi Times reported back in November that NVIDIA was redirecting some of its orders that were originally placed with SMCI to other suppliers. Similarly, during Super Micro Computer's Q1'25 earnings call, when asked by an analyst as to when Blackwell revenues would start showing up in SMCI's books, the company's CEO Charles Liang had bemoaned that "we are asking NVIDIA every day [for those chips]." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Hindenburg Research had leveled damning allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, detailing a litany of malpractices at the firm. Those allegations had then prompted the firm to delay the filing of its annual report for FY 2024 and the quarterly financial statements for Q1 2025. The Nasdaq exchange then concluded that this inordinate delay was inconsistent with its listing requirements. However, on the 06th of December, Nasdaq accepted Super Micro Computer's plan to regain compliance with the exchange's listing requirements, and granted a reprieve until the 25th of February 2025. Meanwhile, SMCI's relentless share price plunge has been sufficient to push the stock out of the Nasdaq 100 index. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Reality TV Producers Urge Buyers To Be Braver & Bolder With Bigger Budgets In 2025

By Peter White Executive Editor, Television It’s been a weird year for the unscripted television business. Networks and streamers have been greenlighting fewer shows and producers are struggling, with numerous mid-size companies closing and layoffs across the sector and global outsourcing and budget issues becoming major talking points with the reality industry. Travis Kelce became a game show host, Alec Baldwin started filming a TLC reality series and Colin Jost is hosting a Jeopardy! spinoff. Blake Shelton and Taylor Sheridan have a new singing competition at CBS, which also is developing a new cooking show with Padma Lakshmi. Hulu breathed new life into reality with Mormon wives, Netflix is going full Willy Wonka, American Gladiators is returning, shows like The Traitors and The Floor are being renewed at quite the clip, and Meghan Markle still is getting attention at Netflix. Watch on Deadline RELATED: Renewed TV Series 2024: A Photo Gallery There were some interesting business models being explored including NBC’s international push with Destination X, Fox taking second windows for Amazon game shows and The CW making low-cost board game adaptations. But there were plenty of shows coming to an end including a swath of Nat Geo titles including Wicked Tuna, Hulu’s The D’Amelio Show and ABC’s Lucky 13. Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules is looking for an entirely new cast. RELATED: 2024 TV Series Cancellations & Renewals There were also a lot of layoffs affecting unscripted execs at Netflix, Lionsgate, The CW, Lifetime, A&E, ABC and Amazon as well as high-profile departures at American Idol and America’s Got Talent, the exit of CBS’ Jack Sussman and the retirement of Warner Bros. Discovery’s Kathleen Finch. On a more positive note, Jeff Gaspin took over reality programming at Netflix. On a corporate level, Amazon looked to sell its unscripted production companies, Fulwell 73 is merging with Lebron James’ Springhill, All3Media completed its takeover by RedBird IMI but closed Maverick TV USA, Asylum Entertainment started investing in companies like Done+Dusted after receiving cash from Endeavor, Wheelhouse scored money from Jeff Bewkes and Kevin Tsujihara and Chick-Fil-A started a streaming service with reality ambitions. RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs So Far In 2024: From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN All well and good, but what’s next year going to look like? Deadline spoke with to close to 50 unscripted producers about their hopes and dreams for 2025. INVESTMENT IN LIVE PROGRAMMING More live event programming. This year we saw so many watercooler moments with The Roast of Tom Brady, Dancing with the Stars going viral with the TikTok generation and the Tyson-Paul fight. That nostalgic feeling of bringing everyone together for a shared cultural experience is important no matter what format or platform people are watching.Rob Mills, EVP Unscripted and Alternative Entertainment, Walt Disney Television (Hulu’s It’s All Country) RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming It’s clear platforms and networks know the value of live programming, but we’d love to see more investment in live content across genres, outside the worlds of sports and comedy. We’ve seen how great live shows can revive event programming, and more innovation in this space from producers and more backing from buyers could be a boon for unscripted.Lucilla D’Agostino, Head, Big Fish Entertainment & Evolution Media (Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules) INTRODUCE UNSCRIPTED TAX INCENTIVES IN CALIFORNIA We hope to see a renewed focus on innovation within the unscripted television industry in 2025, driven by three key changes. First, adopting fresh approaches to bring more original commissions to life, especially bold new American formats that push the boundaries. Second, meaningful subsidies in New York and Los Angeles — the two most important production hubs in the U.S. — are essential to ensuring the longevity of these cities, which are losing productions to cost-cutting pressures. Finally, a stronger commitment to sharing upside will inspire top talent across all disciplines of production to give their best, knowing their efforts are meaningfully rewarded in success.Eli Holzman and Aaron Saidman, Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Television – Nonfiction (ABC’s Shark Tank) I think we are all eagerly hoping for a substantial California Film and Television Tax Credit to be approved in 2025. The unscripted industry could greatly benefit from a portion of that funding to incentivize companies to shoot in L.A. We have an abundance of exceptional above- and below-the-line talent right here, but many are being forced to leave their homes and families for extended periods to earn a living in other states or countries. Let’s keep our industry thriving locally. Come on, Gavin — make it happen! And … ad-funded content has enormous untapped potential to address some of the industry’s toughest challenges for both producers and networks. While there seems to be a growing appetite for it, there hasn’t been much to show for it yet. There are more conversations happening in this space than ever, and I’m hopeful we’ll see more of it come to fruition in 2025. Fewer episodes per season have also become a real challenge — especially for shows with tighter budgets — and small episode orders make it hard for production companies to stay profitable and limit opportunities to tell great stories. Larger episode orders would not only stabilize businesses but also unlock better economies of scale. More episodes equals better stories plus healthier businesses. DEI feels like it’s slipping away, but letting it die is bad business. We’ve got a deep pool of talent, behind the camera and on-screen, that deserves a fair shot. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion isn’t just about doing good; it’s good for the bottom line. Don’t pull the plug in 2025.Jennifer O’Connell and Rebecca Quinn, Co-CEOs, Velvet Hammer Media (The CW’s The Big Bakeover) If Gavin Newsom were to give tax incentives to at least unscripted union series, it would be a significant step toward bringing production back to Hollywood. Without such incentives, achieving a lower price point for these shows becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible.Jenny Daly, President, Critical Content (Netflix’s Sly) We strongly encourage tax incentives for filming unscripted content in Los Angeles. These shows are only as good as the individuals who produce them, and while B17 has tapped into an incredibly talented Canadian community of late, we would also love to utilize the brilliant minds here in L.A. who have contributed to our success over the past decade but currently face limited opportunities.Rhett Bachner and Brien Meagher, Founders, B17 Entertainment (Netflix’s History of Swear Words) TAKE BIGGER RISKS, BUY BOLDER IDEAS It would be wonderful if buyers were more willing to invest in unscripted ideas that have never been done before. At ESNA, we’re fortunate to have access to a wealth of fabulous IP across Banijay, and we thrive on innovating and reimagining concepts to find the “why now.” But when we look at the most daring scripted hits, they are almost always true original ideas. As we move into 2025, my hope for unscripted content is that when a truly great idea excites a buyer, they get to place a bet on it and make something that has never been done before.Sharon Levy, CEO, Endemol Shine North America (Fox’s MasterChef) In 2025, we’d like to see the unscripted community champion more bold and original concepts. While spinoffs and reboots have a valuable place, we’d like to experience a renewed focus on fresh ideas driven by creative risk-taking. By aiming to deliver content that feels genuinely new and exciting, we can meaningfully push the unscripted space forward for audiences and our creative partners. Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks, SVP Development Warner Horizon/Telepictures (ABC’s The Bachelor) We are optimistic about 2025 because there seems to be a real appetite in the global market for big ideas and a growing willingness to partner and collaborate on creating and launching them. We are excited about the new opportunities ahead with the new business models emerging.Allison Wallach, Head of Unscripted Entertainment, Fox Entertainment Studios (Fox’s The Masked Singer) I’m optimistic that 2025 will be the year of risk: buyers taking risks to commission the big, loud ideas they say they want; producers leaving their comfort zones to pull them off; and the industry at large taking a risk on figuring out a way to utilize the incredible talent pool in our country.Karrie Wolfe, Co-Head of Development, North Road’s Kinetic Content (Netflix’s Love Is Blind) The recognition that all our creative futures thrive with a little bit of risk. Great content and breakout formats don’t always get born from deep within a corporate machine that houses 130 labels with footprints in 26 countries. Some of the world’s greatest unscripted formats were created with a spark by a wipe board, pitched with an in-person run-through and then sold to executives and commissioners that were given the freedom and motivation themselves to take the occasional risk. Robin Ashbrook, Founder, theoldschool (Netflix’s Next in Fashion) The single best thing that could happen would be a huge hit show that was sold off paper, without tape, existing IP or big star names and unaltered by data or focus groups. A show that a network just flat-out believed in and took a punt on. Taking risks has never been harder, but it’s the only way to create something special. To get the industry’s courage back, we all need someone to trust their instincts on a totally fresh idea and, critically, turn out to be absolutely right.Glenn Hugill, Chief Content Officer, Wheelhouse (Netflix’s Buying Beverly Hills) I’d love to see the unscripted TV community take braver risks in 2025. Reviving classics will always have its place, but the real future is in creating fresh ideas that connect with audiences now and could become the iconic formats of tomorrow. At Eureka, we’re focused on pushing boundaries with new concepts, and if we all lean into more creativity and bold thinking, 2025 could be truly transformational for the industry.Chris Culvenor, Co-CEO, Eureka Productions (Netflix’s The Mole) For 2025’s unscripted genie, I have three wishes. Firstly, for networks, cablers and streamers to re-allocate budget for unscripted. Secondly, a commitment to developing brand-new and original competition, dating and social experiment formats; we need to keep unscripted audiences engaged. Finally, more! More budget, more commissions, more work for talented unscripted execs, creators, producers, crew and post staff.Julie Pizzi, CEO, Bunim/Murray Productions (MTV’s The Challenge) The unscripted industry was born from creative mavericks who challenged conventions and redefined what television could be. In 2025, I’d like to see us all lean further into that legacy — embracing bold, untested ideas and reigniting the magic that sparked this industry.Matt Sharp, CEO, Sharp Entertainment (TLC’s 90 Day Fiancé) I’d love to lose the word “unscripted” completely and tighten the community here in L.A. In many ways, producers who have been labeled as “unscripted” get the worst of all worlds, quickly relegated to either what’s considered perishable reality volume or precious documentary with a message. But the truth is we are creators, writers, directors, DPs, editors and the nimble problem solvers who work with every storytelling tool imaginable. What I mean is, we are the adaptable ones, the survival of the fittest. We are the ones who can do a lot with a little and we are the ones who should be leading the charge into the great unknown regardless of genre, bucket or past (habitual) Hollywood stigma. We will roll up our sleeves and get it done, so let’s embrace that and redraw the boundaries where creatives can retake control by doing and risk taking. Isn’t that how this business was built?Ari Mark, Co-Founder, Ample Entertainment (Netflix’s This is The Zodiac Speaking) Everyone knows the past few years have been challenging for everyone in the unscripted business — on both sides of the buyer/seller line. My greatest wish for 2025 is for decision-makers to take more strategic chances on new content. Embrace original ideas from creative thinkers who understand how to deliver a big content bang for smart bucks. We all understand that pre-existing IP can be a good choice, and it often works, but the biggest breakthroughs that boosted the bottom line for brands across the past decade have been fresh, risky, exciting new swings. Even in times of significant uncertainty, intelligent risks can be transformative.Gena McCarthy, Unconventional Entertainment (Hallmark+’s Celebrations with Lacey Chabert) One thing I hope will change in 2025 is the downward pressure on budgets, especially as viewership and cultural significance of unscripted projects are at an all-time high on many platforms.Ross Dinerstein, CEO, Campfire Studios (Netflix’s The Menendez Brothers) The game and competition format has been one of the strongest genres ever since it helped launch television in its infancy. Recently, we’ve seen our industry embrace this time-tested formula on both broadcast and streaming platforms. We’re excited for this genre to be revitalized. Gabriel Marano, Head of Television, Hasbro Entertainment (The CW’s Scrabble) Next year I’d love to see unscripted television fully embrace interactive content, such as choose-your-own-adventure formats and augmented reality experiences. These innovations would empower audiences to engage with shows in exciting new ways, creating a more immersive and personal connection. Additionally, I hope to see the continued expansion of successful franchise formats globally, as they provide a unique opportunity to bring diverse stories and perspectives to screens worldwide.Lashan Browning, Founder and CEO, Antoinette Media (MTV’s Love & Hip Hop) In 2025, I’d love to see the unscripted television community fully embrace bold storytelling, artistry and revelatory work that challenges long-held narratives. By championing untold stories from underrepresented voices and speaking truth to power, we have an unparalleled opportunity to engage audiences, spark essential conversations and inspire cultural change. Our industry thrives when we take creative risks, and I hope 2025 is the year we lean into this potential more than ever.Mary Robertson, Maxine Productions (ID’s Quiet On Set) I would like to see more buyers trusting their instincts to greenlight series and renewals. Instead, decisions rest in the hands of giant committees spanning a dozen departments and focus groups largely comprised of people paid $50 for the day to determine the fate of our industry. Leaders like Nancy Dubuc and Eileen O’Neill considered all of that but ultimately relied on their own instincts. They championed series that became hits by stepping outside the safety net of “research.” I miss those days because many hits were born from that decision-making process. The industry is filled with talented high-level executives – let’s empower them to say yes instead of scaring them into saying no.Steve Michaels, CEO, Asylum Entertainment Group (Discovery+’s Hillsong) With networks and platforms prioritizing those “undeniable’ shows” – the slam-dunks – it would be great to see more space for three-pointers: big, fun ideas that might be a bit riskier and more surprising but also offer more upside.Steven Weinstock and Glenda Hersh, Co-CEOs, Truly Original (Bravo’s Summer House) We’d like to see the industry take bigger risks (again) and embrace bolder, more original creative. We want to surprise audiences when they show up, regardless of platform. Fearlessness in finding and lighting up universes and talent defined unscripted for a long time and getting back to that would be a win for the business in every way.Matt Ostrom, Co-Founder, Magilla Entertainment (Discovery’s Moonshiners) The healthiest thing about the unscripted business right now is its embrace of big stories. Making sure that we all also look out for the smaller, lesser-known stories that can have just as big an impact on audiences will keep all of our work fresh, exciting and, best of all, unexpected.Aaron Cohen, Chief Creative Officer, Words + Pictures (HBO’s Murder in Boston) In our current market, some buyers have been more reliant on existing formats and older established IP. While we do benefit from some of this ourselves and understand its value and importance, I would love to see more of a willingness from networks/streamers to make more room for new riskier concepts, as it’s the only way to launch and discover new hits. Sandy Varo Jarrell, CEO, Bright Spot Content (Discovery’s Puppy Bowl) As storytellers, we’ll always bet on ourselves. But at some point, you just can’t do more with less money. Perhaps it’s time for networks to reimagine the traditional commission structure and embrace working with producers and talent to invent unique ways to fund and create content. And let’s take some risks! What we have been doing is not working, so why not be bold and try a new approach? Our greatest successes this year have been when our partners let us take some rights, shared revenue streams and allowed us to be more creatively nimble. Patrick Weiland, President, Intuitive Content (PBS’ Hope in the Water) We hope that in 2025, there is an even bigger and broader appetite across all networks and streamers for unscripted content, because nothing compares to compelling and authentic storytelling through real-life experiences.Eric and Shannon Evangelista, Co-Founders, Hot Snakes Media (ID’s The Curious Case of Natalia Grace) I’d like to see the business shift away from inflated development requests and instead put more trust in proven producers to deliver on great creative ideas. A more direct and efficient approach to proving a concept, on both sides — producer and buyer — could yield such tremendous results for the production community and bring about more opportunities for partnerships to flourish.Jessica Sebastian-Dayeh, President, Maven (Roku’s The Marriage Pact) Return to creativity. I would urge buyers to trust their most creative executives and lean away from relying so heavily on research during the greenlight process. Data and research provide insights into the past, they cannot predict the future. A talented producer with a creative mind will find your next big hit. Fourteen years ago, when I sold Dance Moms — a franchise soon to reach 300 episodes and counting — it wasn’t on anyone’s needs list. No one was looking for that kind of show. It took a network executive with gut instinct and a willingness to take a risk to roll the dice. Today, many of the most talked-about series come from abroad, where risk-taking and creativity are more prominent. We have some of the most talented producers in the history of unscripted television walking among us. There’s never been a better time to let them shine.Jeff Collins, Resilient Content In 2025, I’d like to see less fear in the marketplace and a return to buyers taking bold risks instead of betting solely on sure things. Many of the beloved franchises we enjoy today were born from networks taking unexpected swings, and our industry needs to embrace that spirit again to foster innovation and create a new generation of hit shows. This also means giving shows the time and space to grow — believing in the potential of talent or ideas to develop over time. We need to move away from the mindset that a show’s success is determined by its first outing. In today’s world of fragmented audiences, building loyalty and viewership over time is more critical than ever.Nick Rigg, Brass Monkeys Media PARTNERSHIPS, RIGHTS & COMMUNITY I like to think of the unscripted industry as a team sport. There are a lot of players who have key roles in creating a show, all with the same goal. In 2025, I’d like to see the industry and all its players working together and winning together as a community. By breaking the mold and finding new and creative ways to collaborate, we’ll not only survive until ’25, we’ll thrive.Toby Gorman, President, Universal Television Alternative Studio (NBC’s That’s My Jam) The recent shift in the market I believe has brought many in the unscripted community closer together than ever. Both network buyers and producers are feeling the effects, which I hope sparks a deeper sense of partnership and solidarity between both sides on every collaboration.Jimmy Fox, EVP Unscripted Development and Sales, Fremantle (ABC’s American Idol) I think what we all want is to see everyone back to work. Any innovative business models, partnerships or incentives that help keep productions Stateside would bring a significant lift to the industry.Adam Sher, President, ITV America (Peacock’s Love Island) This is not the first time co-productions have been on the table for networks in the U.S. – quite the contrary. Once upon a time, each U.S. linear network had dedicated executives with the word “co-production” in their title. They would go out to market and find a distributor willing to come in to help close financing. I don’t know how much of that is happening, but the producers need the networks to be more willing to open this back up in a real way. For their own survival, U.S. linear networks should build relationships with networks internationally to be able to make quick calls to trust partners and say, “Hey, do you want it? We love this but need $50,000 an ep to close financing.” I know that U.S. network-to-international network conversations are happening on a very small level, but they need to expand those conversations. The networks are relying on the producers and distributors to go out and find the money, but all options need to be on the table in the market — all hands on deck. JC Mills, President and Head of Content, Cineflix (History’s American Pickers) We as nonfiction professionals have always been a resourceful and resilient group, and I’m hoping 2025 is when we can put that mindset even more into action. I think the sooner we accept that the market is the market, the sooner we can see the opportunities that exist for us to thrive in this new landscape. The opportunities may not be in the places we’ve experienced them in the past, but there are opportunities in new places, genres and strategies that can position our industry for continued success. In the early 2000s, unscripted was thought of by many in the scripted world as cheap, filler programming. We turned that around then, and we can do that again as we work with our distribution partners to build a new nonfiction marketplace. But it’s up to us to open our creative aperture and find those new genres and platforms to keep our audiences engaged in nonfiction storytelling.Jeff Hasler, President, Original Productions (Discovery’s Deadliest Catch) More buyers who recognize the extraordinary opportunity and value offered by nonfiction programming. Drive the culture. Be a part of the conversation. Win big awards. Make your subscribers even happier. Nonfiction offers it all.R.J. Cutler, Founder, This Machine (Netflix’s Martha) The heart of unscripted will always be the people. In 2025, I would love to come back to that guiding light and see all of us in the community, networks and producers taking more chances to let the casts and stories develop organically. Our industry will thrive as long as we continue to support these bold personalities who we all love.Carlos King, CEO, Kingdom Reign Entertainment (OWN’s Belle Collective) 2024 was truly a rough year for our industry, both scripted and unscripted. There were fewer pickups, more layoffs, tight budgets, high expectations and a general sense of dread that consumed what had been a thriving community of entertainment creatives. As we look toward 2025, we should do so with hope, as well as a realistic sense of expectations. My dream for 2025 is to lock arms with our network partners to create fresh, innovative content that will reinvigorate their audience’s decades-long passion for unscripted storytelling.Rob Eric, Chief Content Officer, Scout Productions (Netflix’s Queer Eye) Treat production companies as partners, not vendors, and the relationship will thrive. The industry has been weighed down by hesitation and fear, with too much posturing born from anxiety. It’s time to take bold risks and move faster. That’s what will inject new life into the business. Accelerate renewals, reduce development limbo and stand out in a crowded marketplace. Let’s prioritize real action and restore a higher standard of professionalism and ethical business practices. The industry cannot move forward by standing still. It’s time to take decisive steps and create real momentum.David Brady, CEO, Cream Productions (Netflix’s Age of Samurai) We’d love to see the industry embrace a more fluid rights universe and have more open and serious conversations about substantial U.S. licensing deals that allow producers to pursue international and other future sales. This could be an incredibly effective solution to the challenges that both buyers and sellers are facing, and while we’ve already begun to see the pendulum swing in this direction, it would be great to see those discussions and deals become more widespread in 2025.Greg Henry and Kim Woodard, Co-Presidents, Lucky 8 (Netflix’s Unlocked) Let’s have some fun in 2025 and appreciate how fortunate are we to get paid to entertain folks. So let’s stop obsessing about staying alive to ‘25 and focus instead on the creative opportunities that change generates. Because we at Plimsoll love TV, we categorically refuse to spend the next 12 months feeling downcast about the state of the industry.

(Julie Appleby, 12/19) Democratic Senators Ask Watchdog Agency To Investigate Georgia’s Medicaid Work Rule A group of Democratic senators asked the Government Accountability Office to examine a Georgia program that requires some Medicaid enrollees to work, study, or volunteer 80 hours a month for coverage.

Health Care Costs US Health Spending Rose 7.5% In 2023 To $4.9 Trillion, CMS Says The growth was primarily spurred by private health insurance and Medicare, according to CMS officials. Spending on hospital care increased, as well. The UnitedHealthcare shooting is also in the news. MedPage Today: Health Spending Up 7.5% In 2023, CMS Says Health spending in the U.S. rose by 7.5% in 2023, to $4.9 trillion, compared with an increase of 4.6% in 2022, according to figures released Wednesday by CMS. "Much of the growth came from faster growth and spending [by] private health insurance, which increased 11.5%, and Medicare, which increased 8.1%," Anne Martin, of the CMS Office of the Actuary, said during a briefing sponsored by Health Affairs. "For Medicaid, although spending and enrollment continue to increase, the rates of growth were lower in 2023 compared with 2022 -- Medicaid spending grew by 7.9% in 2023 compared with 9.7% growth in 2022." (Frieden, 12/18) Axios: Spending On Hospital Care Surged In 2023: CMS U.S spending on hospital care grew at its fastest clip in more than three decades last year, according to a new federal analysis of health expenditures. Higher demand for medical procedures, including more Medicare patients receiving outpatient care, helped drive a 10.4% year-over-year spending surge on hospitals while prices for services remained relatively stable. (Goldman, 12/19) The Wall Street Journal: Why Are Americans Paying So Much More for Healthcare Than They Used to? The killing of a health insurance executive in New York City prompted a furious outpouring of anger over the industry and healthcare prices. So just how much have healthcare costs and spending been going up? The short answer: a lot. National healthcare spending increased 7.5% year over year in 2023 to $4.867 trillion, or $14,570 per person, according to data released Wednesday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (Torry, 12/18) KFF Health News: Obamacare Sign-Ups Lag After Trump Election, Legal Challenges New enrollments under the Affordable Care Act are on pace to trail last year’s record numbers by as many as a million as the outgoing Biden administration confronts upheavals in the program. Donald Trump’s election to a second term has cast uncertainty around the future of the health law.

(Appleby, 12/19) KFF Health News: He Went In For A Colonoscopy. The Hospital Charged $19,000 For Two Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks. The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues. (Meyer, 12/19) UnitedHealthcare shooting update — The New York Times: Suspect In Insurance C.E.O.’s Murder Is Said To Face Federal Charges The suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive on a Manhattan sidewalk this month will now face federal charges in addition to the state murder indictment brought against him, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. ... Federal charges would potentially allow prosecutors to pursue the death penalty, which has been outlawed in New York for decades. (Marcius, Rashbaum and Meko, 12/18) Capitol Watch Congress Scrambles For Plan B After Trump, Musk Torpedo Spending Deal The stopgap bill was stuffed with unrelated policy measures, which President-elect Donald Trump blasted on social media as "[giving] the Democrats everything they want.” The clock is now ticking on a Friday night deadline for a federal government shutdown. The New York Times: Trump, Egged On By Musk, Condemns Spending Deal, Raising Fears Of Government Shutdown A bipartisan spending deal to avert a shutdown was on life support on Wednesday after President-elect Donald J. Trump condemned it, leaving lawmakers without a strategy to fund the government past a Friday night deadline. Mr. Trump issued a scathing statement ordering Republicans not to support the sprawling bill, piling on to a barrage of criticism from Elon Musk, who spent Wednesday trashing the measure on social media and threatening any Republican who supported it with political ruin. (Edmondson and Hulse, 12/18) The Hill: Johnson Considers Plan B Amid Trump World Opposition To Spending Deal Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is looking at a plan B to fund the government ahead of Friday’s shutdown deadline as Republicans inside and outside the Capitol, including President-elect Trump and his allies, slam his spending package. The back-up option Johnson is examining is a “clean” continuing resolution, two sources familiar with the matter told The Hill. That would entail dropping the additional provisions that were included in the initial 1,500-page spending package negotiated by congressional leaders, including disaster aid and economic assistance for farmers. (Schnell, 12/18) The New York Times: What’s Inside The Spending Bill To Avoid A Government Shutdown? The stopgap spending bill congressional leaders agreed on this week began as a simple funding measure to keep government funds flowing past a Friday night deadline and into early next year, long after House Republicans elect a speaker and President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in. But by the time it was rolled out to lawmakers on Tuesday night, it had transformed into a true Christmas tree of a bill, adorned with all manner of unrelated policy measures in the kind of year-end catchall that Republicans have long derided. It is a 1,547-page behemoth of a package with provisions including foreign investment restrictions, new health care policies and a stadium site for the Washington Commanders. (Edmondson, 12/18) Also — The Washington Post: Senate Passes Pentagon NDAA That Set Off Transgender-Care Debate The Senate on Wednesday passed an $895.2 billion defense policy bill that sparked controversy when House Speaker Mike Johnson amended the legislation with language forbidding the use of federal funds to cover specialized medical care for the transgender children of U.S. military personnel. Though several Senate Democrats protested Johnson’s 11th-hour maneuver, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was approved 85-14 — a comfortable margin that belied the depth of frustration among lawmakers who said the legislation, as written, discriminates against thousands of military families and their right to health care. The bill heads next to the president, who is expected to sign it into law. Several senior Democratic senators said that while they shared their colleagues’ frustration with the transgender-care provision, the NDAA was too important to fail. (Hauslohner, 12/18) KFF Health News: Democratic Senators Ask Watchdog Agency To Investigate Georgia’s Medicaid Work Rule Three Democratic senators asked the country’s top nonpartisan government watchdog on Tuesday to investigate the costs of a Georgia program that requires some people to work to receive Medicaid coverage. The program, called “Georgia Pathways to Coverage,” is the nation’s only active Medicaid work requirement. Pathways has cost tens of millions in federal and state dollars on administration and consulting fees while enrolling 5,542 people as of Nov. 1, according to KFF Health News’ reporting. (Miller, Rayasam and Whitehead, 12/18) Administration News RFK Jr. Open To Restrictions on Medication Abortion, Senator Says Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said Wednesday that during his meeting with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday, the HHS nominee pledged to support any effort to restrict mifepristone. Plus: What do Americans really think of Kennedy's health policies? The Hill: Hawley: Kennedy Supports Restrictions On Abortion Pill Mifepristone Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, pledged to support efforts to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone if Trump wants to. Hawley told reporters Wednesday he suggested to Kennedy during a Tuesday meeting that “it would be a wise idea to return to the rule under the last Trump administration, which required in-person dispensing” of the drug. (Weixel, 12/18) The Washington Post: RFK Jr. Tries To Build Momentum For HHS Candidacy On Capitol Hill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived on Capitol Hill this week with a clear goal: build support for his controversial selection to lead the nation’s health agencies. So far, so good. Kennedy has met with more than a dozen GOP senators, with many lawmakers praising those conversations and signaling that they plan to vote to confirm him as secretary of health and human services next year. (Diamond, Roubein and Liss-Roy, 12/18) The Boston Globe: RFK Jr. Is Telling Republican Senators What They Want To Hear The moment he arrived on Capitol Hill this week as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confronted with perhaps the top task of his confirmation: papering over his decades-long record of controversy. ... The fact that Kennedy needed to declare his support for the polio vaccine, one of the great medical advances of the 20th century, stems from a New York Times report that one of his top advisers had petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval for the life-saving injection. (Brodey and Puzzanghera, 12/19) AP: What Americans Think Of RFK Jr. And His Health Stances The kids seen by Dolores Mejia around suburban Phoenix have been growing heavier in recent years. Their parents, too, she says. Mejia, a 75-year-old retiree, says she’s also had her own weight struggles on the scale. That’s why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to “Make America Healthy Again” as he campaigned alongside Donald Trump caught her attention. She liked the questions Kennedy raised about the role of processed foods in America’s obesity epidemic. After hearing Kennedy out, she concluded: “We cannot trust the health organizations we’ve trusted for years to tell us that our foods are safe.” (Seitz and Sanders, 12/18) Also — NPR: After Losing VP Bid, Walz Searches For Role In Pushing Back Against Trump With Republican pickups both nationally and in his home state, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is searching for the right balance when preparing to push back against GOP priorities, while also showing that he's willing to work with them on issues important to middle class voters. After Democrats lost the presidential election, Walz is now back home working out of the state capitol in St. Paul, Minn., where he recently described the one question that keeps him up at night - why more voters chose President-elect Donald Trump. (Masters, 12/19) Outbreaks and Health Threats Nation's First Severe Case Of Bird Flu In Humans Reported In Louisiana The CDC believes that the patient, who is in critical condition, may have caught it from a backyard flock.

(Harrington, Moniuszko and Padilla, 12/18) Bloomberg: What To Know About Bird Flu And Pandemic Fears For influenza viruses, imperfection is a strength. They constantly mutate, producing new strains that challenge immune systems primed to fight earlier varieties. That’s what makes flu a life-long threat to humans and the animal species — mainly birds — that are vulnerable to it. Since 2020, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza called H5N1 has been decimating both wild and domestic birds. Now it’s spreading among US dairy cows, and has infected dozens of people, mainly US farmworkers exposed to sick cattle and poultry. (Griffin, Peng, and Smith, 12/18) Los Angeles Times: More L.A. Cats Appear To Be Infected With H5N1 Bird Flu Experts believe three more cats in Los Angeles County have been infected with H5N1 bird flu. Two others succumbed to the disease earlier this month after drinking recalled raw milk from Fresno-based Raw Farm LLC dairies. Of the three new sick cats, two died and one tested positive for influenza A, an unusual finding in domestic cats that haven’t been exposed to infected birds or contaminated dairy products. (Rust, 12/18) In other health concerns — Los Angeles Times: UCLA Doctors Identify 'Alarming' New Strain Of XDR Shigella Three men sought help at clinics or emergency rooms in Los Angeles County over a three-month period this year, each reporting severe diarrhea and a recent history of sexual contact with other men. Stool cultures revealed that all three were infected with Shigella sonnei, a strain of Shigella bacteria that is resistant to five of the antibiotic classes most commonly prescribed for such infections. But upon further analysis, the UCLA researchers analyzing the samples realized they were looking at something altogether new. (Purtill, 12/18) San Francisco Chronicle: San Francisco Seafood Company Issues ‘Urgent’ Recall For Oysters A San Francisco seafood company issued an “urgent product recall” for oysters after they were linked to potential norovirus contamination.

Claims CVS' Push To Fill Prescriptions Fueled Opioid Crisis On Wednesday, the DOJ accused CVS of using compensation incentives to push pharmacists to fill as many prescriptions as possible without assessing their legitimacy first. Meanwhile, big retailers providing health care look at ways to pivot in 2025; VA investigation into mental health providers; and more. The Washington Post: U.S. Accuses CVS Of Unlawfully Filling Opioid Prescriptions The Justice Department on Wednesday accused CVS Pharmacy of incentivizing pharmacists to fill illegal opioid prescriptions for more than a decade, a practice that fueled the nation’s opioid crisis. The complaint, filed in Providence, Rhode Island, where CVS is headquartered, alleges that the country’s largest retail pharmacy violated the False Claims Act and Controlled Substances Act by filling prescriptions for controlled substances that lacked legitimate medical purpose or were not valid, including prescriptions for “dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids.” (Ziegler, 12/18) Modern Healthcare: How CVS Health, Walgreens, Amazon May Approach Healthcare In 2025 Big retailers providing healthcare services have a lot to prove in 2025. This past year was a defining year for retailers and not necessarily in a good way, as there were multiple failed attempts at offering more healthcare services. For Walmart and Walgreens, the high costs of care and reimbursement pressures derailed their plans to disrupt healthcare and grow revenue. ... Meanwhile, CVS Health, Kroger and Amazon are forging ahead with plans to offer more services through brick-and-mortar clinics and virtual platforms.

(Kime, 12/18) Insurance developments — Modern Healthcare: CMS' TEAM Could Cost Some Hospitals Hundreds: Report A mandatory hospital payment model finalized this year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could make earnings uncertain for providers, researchers said.

(Early, 12/18) Modern Healthcare: Group Medicare Advantage Costs Rising For Public Sector Plans Jessica Linart was shocked at the Medicare Advantage premiums insurers proposed for covering retired Colorado civil servants next year.

Katie Hobbs is calling for legislators to repeal the state law that requires an annual abortion report, saying that it infringes on patients’ privacy, which echoes other Democratic officials’ push to reduce or eliminate such requirements. “The government has no place in surveilling Arizonans’ medical decision-making or tracking their health history,” Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the Legislature, said in a statement Wednesday as the state released its report covering 2023. “Starting a family is a sensitive and personal experience for a woman and her loved ones; there should be no room for government surveillance and publication of that decision.” (Mulvihill, 12/18) In related news — ProPublica: If You’re Pregnant, Here’s What You Should Know About the Medical Procedures That Could Save Your Life Women experiencing pregnancy loss in states with abortion bans told us they wished they had known what to expect and how to advocate for themselves.

Doctors discovered a lump during her sister's mammogram back in 2008 that came back positive for breast cancer. Genetic testing revealed both had the BRCA gene – one that puts someone at higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers – something they were previously unaware of. But it's not unsurprising: ... Approximately 1 in 40 Ashkenazi Jewish people carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations; it's about 1 in 400 people in the general population.

Other public health news is on the health risks of formaldehyde, brain-computer interfaces, microplastics, social media, and more. USA Today: Americans Are Living Longer, Thanks To Pandemic's End, Fewer Opioid Deaths Average life expectancy in the U.S. increased by almost a year in 2023, rebounding to a level not reached since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to figures released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. average life expectancy was 78.4 years in 2023 ‒ nearly 11 months longer than in 2022 ‒ mostly due to far fewer COVID-19 deaths. It was the second consecutive year the nation's life expectancy increased after dropping more than two years from 2019 to 2021. (Alltucker, 12/19) ProPublica: Sen. Blumenthal Urges “Science-Based” EPA Approach On Formaldehyde Risk Citing a recent ProPublica investigation, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged the Environmental Protection Agency in a letter this week to issue a final report on the health risks of formaldehyde that is “science-based” and “as strong as possible,” adding that “the agency has an obligation to protect the public from the chemical.” Formaldehyde, used for everything from preserving dead bodies to binding wood products and producing plastic, is extremely widespread and causes far more cancer than any toxic air pollutant.

(Broderick, 12/18) The Washington Post: What We Just Found Out About The Possible Tie Between Microplastics And Cancer When a car rolls down a freeway, a fine spray of microplastics spews out from its tires. When you wash your clothes, millions of tiny synthetic microfibers spill into waterways. And those tiny pieces of plastic may be harming our health, a new study shows. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, researchers at the University of California at San Francisco evaluated dozens of studies in mice and humans to learn how microplastics may be harming digestive, respiratory and reproductive health. They found that these shards — which are now virtually everywhere in the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat — are suspected of links to colon cancer and lung cancer.

Title: US asks Nvidia, Super Micro to investigate how chips ended up in China, the Information reports

(Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Commerce has recently asked Nvidia to look into how the company's products ended up in China over the past year, The Information reported on Thursday, citing a person close to the department. The chip giant has asked big distributors such as Super Micro Computer and Dell Technologies to conduct spot checks of their customers in Southeast Asia, the report said. Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips are embedded in server products made by Super Micro and Dell. The Information reported that five different people involved in smuggling Nvidia chips said they have managed so far to evade detection during recent inspections by Super Micro. "We insist that our customers and partners strictly adhere to all export control restrictions. Any unauthorized deviation of previously-owned products, including any grey market resales, would be a burden on our business, not a benefit," an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed response. Some of the customers duplicated serial numbers of the servers containing Nvidia chips that they purchased from Super Micro and attached them to other servers that they had access to, the report said, citing a person close to Super Micro. In some cases, smugglers even altered the serial numbers in the operating system for the servers, the report said. Dell said the company requires its distributors and resellers to follow all applicable regulations and export controls. The company added that it takes appropriate action "up to and including termination" of its relationship if a partner is not adhering to these obligations. Super Micro said it investigates and takes action against any unauthorized exports or re-exports of its products by third parties. "Supermicro follows all U.S. export control requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses under the Export Administration Regulations," the company told Reuters. The commerce department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Joe Biden administration has doubled down on its chip crackdown in China. The U.S. broadened a ban on the sale of high-end AI chips to the country last year. Still, several Chinese universities and research institutes procured these Nvidia chips via resellers, a Reuters review of tender documents showed earlier in 2024. Earlier this month, the U.S. curbed semiconductor exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers.

Title: Nvidia stock rebounds after broad market rout as analysts stay bullish on outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

POLAND - 2024/11/17: In this photo illustration, the Mastercard company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Mastercard’s stock (NYSE: MA) is up approximately 25% year-to-date compared to the 27% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. In comparison, Mastercard’s peer Visa (NYSE: V) has returned about 22%. So what are some of the factors driving Mastercard stock higher? The company outperformed the street estimates in the third quarter of FY 2024. It reported net revenues of $7.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Several factors are driving growth for the company. For one, cross-border volumes rose 17% year-over-year led by higher international travel as well as e-commerce growth. Gross dollar volumes were also up 10%, while the number of switched transactions was up 11%. Switched transactions refer to the transactions processed via the Mastercard platform. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Further, revenues from value-added services and solutions grew 18% in the quarter driven by higher demand for the company’s consulting and marketing services as well as the scaling of its fraud and security and identity and authentication solutions. Adjusted net income was up by about 12% compared to last year to $3.6 billion, growing slightly slower than revenues due to higher general and administrative expenses. As an aside, check out Buy, Sell, Or Hold Alaska Air Stock? The increase in MA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 1% in 2021, -3% in 2022, and 23% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what’s the outlook like for MA stock? There are a couple of trends that could drive MA stock going forward. The Fed’s recent interest rate cuts could help reduce borrowing costs and potentially drive spending on credit cards, directly benefiting Mastercard’s transaction volumes and fee revenues. Moreover, Mastercard’s investments into expanding in emerging markets, including regions such as Asia, the Middle East, and Africa could give the company more scope for growth given its highly recognizable brand and the increasing push toward digital and cashless transactions. Mastercard has been doubling down on its shareholder returns. The company’s board recently approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the company to buy back up to $12 billion in stock. The company also raised its quarterly dividend to $0.76 compared to its previous dividend of $0.66. We value Mastercard stock at about $518 per share, which is roughly in line with the current market price. See our analysis of Mastercard’s valuation.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday finalized an award to SK Hynix of up to $458 million in government grants to help fund an advanced chip packaging plant and research and development facility for artificial intelligence products in Indiana. In April, the Nvidia supplier said it would invest $3.87 billion to build the West Lafayette facility which will include an assembly line to mass produce next-generation high bandwidth memory chips. The chips are used in graphic processing units that train artificial intelligence systems. The department also plans to make available $500 million in government loans for the SK Hynix project. The grant funds would be distributed when SK Hynix meets project milestones. The project will create 1,000 jobs and fill a key gap in the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, the department said. Kwak Noh-Jung, CEO of the world's second-largest memory chip maker, said in a statement the company looks forward to working "to build a robust and resilient AI semiconductor supply chain in the U.S." Congress in August 2022 approved a $39 billion subsidy program for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and related components along with $75 billion in government lending authority. The Commerce Department is awarding major grants to all five leading semiconductor manufacturers - TSMC, Intel, Samsung Electronics, Micron and SK Hynix. The department has now finalized all of those but the $6.4 billion Samsung award. This month it finalized a $75 million award to Absolics for constructing a facility in Georgia to supply advanced materials to the country's semiconductor industry. Absolics is an affiliate of SKC, which in turn is part of South Korea's second-largest conglomerate SK Group, as is SK Hynix.

Title: Dendias and the military camps, the donors and… poor Loukas, the registrar’s anxiety, and the new investor in Athens hotels

Time Published: 2024-12-19T09:32:19Z

Hello there! With the holiday season upon us, it seems the Christmas spirit is spreading, and the idea of goodwill is more prominent than ever. Let me begin with an event that took place yesterday at the Ministry of National Defense. Thanasis Laskaridis and his family laid the foundation for the new building of the Special Cyber Unit of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA), which will be constructed thanks to a donation by the “Athanasios C. Laskaridis Foundation,” named after him. The modest ceremony was attended by Minister Nikos Dendias, Deputy Minister Yiannis Kefalogiannis, the host, GEETHA Chief General Dimitris Choupis, and a select few distinguished guests, including U.S. Ambassador George Tsounis and Chania MP Sevi Voloudaki. Minister Dendias expressed his gratitude for the donation, noting that last year, donations to the Ministry of Defense amounted to €234,000, while this year they soared to €26 million. Interesting, right? But even more striking was the closing remark of the donor, Thanasis Laskaridis, which I’ll quote verbatim: “After all, as the popular song says, dedicated to poor Loukas, we won’t take a single penny to the grave. It’s good, then, for those whom God has blessed with some surplus to do something to help our homeland. It’s time for all of us to get rid of the ‘crabs in our pockets’ and do whatever we can, whatever is necessary.” Dendias’ Commentary and Military Camp Rumors During the same event, Dendias couldn’t avoid questions from those present about the well-known issue (regarding the President of the Republic), jokingly responding, “Well, I’m probably the last person who could comment on this matter,” which, of course, has been settled for a while now—if it was ever truly open. On the other hand, the Minister was much more talkative about efforts to modernize military camps, making sure to throw in a jab about the sparse rumors suggesting that the areas formerly used as camps will be turned into business ventures. “When someone wants to slander another person or initiative, they immediately turn it into a story about interests and that’s the end of it,” he remarked. The Registrar’s Anxiety (Which Has Ended) Over Pavlos Possibly today—or at the latest tomorrow—the former royal family will take action regarding their citizenship. Whether their lawyer will show up, as happened with Michel de Grèce, or Pavlos himself will make an appearance, I can’t say for sure. However, what I can say is that yesterday at the Athens Registry Office, there was quite a commotion, with phones ringing off the hook as employees scrambled to handle all the technical details of the forthcoming request. This was complicated by the fact that certain procedures have been digitized since the Venizelos law. After all, it’s not every day that the former royal family gets added to the records. I hear that written instructions were issued yesterday by the Ministry of the Interior to ensure everything goes smoothly when the request is made. The process is simple: the request is submitted, the Registry Office forwards it to the Ministry of the Interior along with the required documents, and the Ministry determines whether the applicant can be registered or not. That’s what we reported this morning. Eventually, at 11 a.m., it was confirmed that Pavlos and Nikolaos submitted the relevant application at the Athens Registry Office through their proxy lawyer. The surname they chose is “De Grèce,” and a total of 10 members of the former royal family have signed the application. Elections in the Regional Unions It’s a day of decisions for the Union of Greek Regions, as today the successor to Tzitzikostas will be chosen. The role is expected to go to the governor of the South Aegean, Giorgos Hatzimarkos. Following Nikos Hardalias’ announcement that he is withdrawing from the Presidency, the first vice-presidency is set to go to the governor of Crete, Stavros Arnaoutakis, and the second vice-presidency to the governor of the Peloponnese, Dimitris Ptochos. 5% Decrease in Abstention Due to Electoral Roll Cleanup The Ministry of the Interior has received very few applications to reverse deletions from the electoral rolls. This means that in the next national elections, the number of registered voters will be approximately 440,000 fewer. These are individuals aged 80 and above who have had no physical presence in the country or have passed away but had not been removed from the rolls until now due to unreported deaths to the relevant Greek authorities. These individuals contribute to the abstention rates, inflating them by about 5%. Parliament’s New Year Under the Shadow of Presidential Speculation Parliament will suspend its work tonight for the holiday season and is expected to reopen on January 8. Don’t ask me about the legislative agenda because I estimate that the only topic occupying the political and journalistic scene will be the individual proposed by Kyriakos Mitsotakis for the position of President of the Republic. The Prime Minister stated in his interview with ERT that he would reveal the name within the second half of January, triggering another wave of speculation. The official process is expected to commence in Parliament in early February 2025. According to the Constitution, the absolute deadline for the first vote is February 13, one month before the end of Katerina Sakellaropoulou’s term. The first vote requires a majority of 200 MPs; the same threshold applies for the second vote, which takes place five days later. The third vote lowers the threshold to 180 MPs, the fourth to 151 MPs, and, finally, the fifth requires only a relative majority. Poor Anagnostopoulos, what a fate you’ve met After the €5.5 million fines issued yesterday to eight multinational companies, and with more likely to follow for retail chains, no one would want to be in the shoes of the General Secretary of Commerce and Consumer Protection, S. Anagnostopoulos. The General Secretary has been invited tomorrow, Friday, to speak at an internal event of SELPE, the association of major retail chains. The big retail chains are up in arms over the fines, as they believe that the system implemented by the ministry is intentionally convoluted and complex, aimed at imposing fines they deem to serve public relations purposes. So tomorrow, Anagnostopoulos is expected to face heavy pressure as they demand clear rules. Meanwhile, note that a total of 26 companies—multinationals, food manufacturers, and other consumer goods firms, as well as supermarket chains—are under investigation to determine if they comply with the law on profit margin caps. Yesterday’s announcements involved eight companies, so expect more to come in the next few days. The last law passed by Parliament for 2024 extends the validity of the law on “caps on gross profit margins for all products essential for consumer nutrition and dignified living” until April 2025. For now, the government’s intention—provided market conditions stabilize—is not to extend the measure further beyond April, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Hotels: A new investor for Attica Banks are aiming to increase their financing and are closely monitoring tenders and other processes for the sale of European banks’ maritime loan portfolios. Piraeus Bank has taken a significant step by providing over €100 million in financing following a competitive process to the Cypriot Thanos Resort & Hotels, owned by Thanos Michaelides. Michaelides plans to expand his presence in Greece’s hotel sector. The group, which includes the Anassa in Paphos, intends to invest in Attica and Milos. The race to break the €4 barrier Speaking of Piraeus Bank, its stock is once again approaching the €4 mark—the level at which a placement was made last March for 27% of the share capital. Since then, the stock has only managed to stay above this level for three trading sessions, closing at the same price on three other occasions, with an intraday high of €4.08. Yesterday it closed at €3.91, showing an inclination to move toward €4. However, there’s often a gap between intention and reality. We’ll see if the stock gets closer to the generous target prices given by analysts, which range from €5 (Deutsche Bank), €5.90 (JPM), and even €6.31 (Eurobank Equities). Salary increases at SEV The new president of SEV (Hellenic Federation of Enterprises), Spyros Theodoropoulos, brings extensive experience in business transformations and restructuring. He’s undertaking a similar effort at SEV, implementing a new organizational chart and redistributing responsibilities. The goal is to bring SEV’s members closer to society and to activate all members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee in SEV’s daily operations. This ambitious effort demands considerable work from SEV’s 60 employees, which is why one of the new administration’s first decisions was to significantly increase their salaries. Manousakis’ term at ADMIE renewed Last night, ADMIE Holdings sent a letter to the Chinese State Grid announcing the renewal of the term of ADMIE SA’s Chairman and CEO, Manos Manousakis. The term has been renewed for four years. The Board of Directors will meet tomorrow, Friday, to approve the renewal. €110 million investments in clean energy storage Staying in the energy sector, Deputy Energy Minister Alexandra Sdoukou met yesterday with representatives of 15 companies selected in the first two energy storage tenders. The government aims to expedite the construction of energy storage stations, offering operational support and investment aid. Investors, who collectively are investing €110 million in lithium battery energy storage systems, highlighted key issues they face, primarily the need for new connection infrastructure, such as the development or expansion of substations and networks. These processes are often delayed due to lengthy equipment procurement timelines. Additionally, delays in licensing procedures that impact overall project progress were also discussed. Sdoukou pledged to support each case individually, announcing the creation of a special coordination team. This team will work closely with ADMIE, RAE, and DAPEEP to resolve all licensing and technical issues. Timely project completion is critical, as they are funded by the Recovery Fund under strict deadlines. Let’s see if anything gets done! Lavipharm’s Investment Lavipharm’s new investment in transdermal drug production is set to launch in early 2025. The modifications and expansion of part of the production facilities in Paiania have already been completed, and the mechanical equipment is arriving in Greece in the coming period. This investment is a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical company’s business plan, as it will double its transdermal production capacity, while the addition of the new production line ensures uninterrupted manufacturing. Over the past five years, Lavipharm has achieved a 55% increase in its market share, and its management has stated that it is exploring opportunities for new drug acquisitions while also making new moves focused on pharmaceutical production. Alumil’s “Trump Trade” Alumil, led by G. Mylonas, is steadily moving towards a market capitalization of €150 million. Its stock, now at €4.59, is 58.2% higher than three months ago. After struggling through the tough years of 2013–2022 and eventually reaching an agreement with banks and servicers to handle its heavy debt load, Alumil is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. The next step is to spin off its casting division and sell 70% of the new company (Alufond) to a foreign investor. G. Mylonas, encouraged by Trump’s election, has turned his gaze across the Atlantic, aiming to finalize the deal within the first quarter of 2025. Even if it slips to the second quarter, it’s no big deal—after all, in the market, you hear a lot of talk but see little action. Window Dressing Next week, the Athens Stock Exchange will remain closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the day after. Opportunities for short-term investment strategies are extremely limited. The primary goal of window dressing remains a top priority. As previously mentioned, Piraeus Bank aims to bridge the gap to the €4 placement level (yesterday it closed at €3.91, up +1.79%) so that those who invested at that time don’t end the year in the red. Similarly, National Bank has risen to €7.70 (+1.45%), Athens International Airport to €8, Cenergy to €9.25, and so on. By Tuesday, December 31, everyone will close their books with satisfaction and present the results of their efforts to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders. These movements, coupled with the lack of large-scale strategic placements, have brought the General Index to 1,455.67 points, with a modest increase of +0.2%. While trading volume may appear higher, it isn’t—of the €155.3 million total, €57.1 million came from a large Eurobank package and several smaller ones, leaving €85 million in stock trades on the board. Once again, Coca-Cola HBC, typically the General Index’s reliable supporter, remained at €32.80 (-1.5%), leaving OPAP (+2.21% at €15.74) and Motor Oil (+1.38%) to take over its role. Meanwhile, a consistent seller is holding PPC at €11.70, despite analysts’ glowing reports making headlines. Nuclear Energy and Artificial Intelligence: Parallel Paths Yesterday, Meta published an RFP (Request for Proposals) seeking a provider for a nuclear energy installation of up to 4 gigawatts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. This move reflects a broader trend in the artificial intelligence industry, where the exponential growth in computational requirements is creating unprecedented demand for stable and reliable energy. Meta’s strategy to place nuclear plants near its data centers aims to minimize energy transmission losses. Given that Meta is already the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the U.S., with 6.7 GW in operation, this step marks a new era where nuclear energy suddenly emerges as a key pillar for the growth of artificial intelligence.

Archives An intensification of surface Earth’s energy imbalance since the late 20th century, Li et al., Communications Earth & Environment: Tracking the energy balance of the Earth system is a key method for studying the contribution of human activities to climate change. However, accurately estimating the surface energy balance has long been a challenge, primarily due to uncertainties that dwarf the energy flux changes induced and a lack of precise observational data at the surface. We have employed the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, integrating it with recent developments in surface solar radiation observational data, to refine the ensemble of CMIP6 model outputs. This has resulted in an enhanced estimation of Surface Earth System Energy Imbalance (EEI) changes since the late 19th century. Our findings show that CMIP6 model outputs, constrained by this observational data, reflect changes in energy imbalance consistent with observations in Ocean Heat Content (OHC), offering a narrower uncertainty range at the 95% confidence level than previous estimates. Observing the EEI series, dominated by changes due to external forcing, we note a relative stability (0.22 Wm−2) over the past half-century, but with a intensification (reaching 0.80 Wm−2) in the mid to late 1990s, indicating an escalation in the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, which provides another independent confirmation of what recent studies have shown. Fusion of Probabilistic Projections of Sea-Level Rise, Grandey et al., Earth's Future: A probabilistic projection of sea-level rise uses a probability distribution to represent scientific uncertainty. However, alternative probabilistic projections of sea-level rise differ markedly, revealing ambiguity, which poses a challenge to scientific assessment and decision-making. To address the challenge of ambiguity, we propose a new approach to quantify a best estimate of the scientific uncertainty associated with sea-level rise. Our proposed fusion combines the complementary strengths of the ice sheet models and expert elicitations that were used in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under a low-emissions scenario, the fusion's very likely range (5th–95th percentiles) of global mean sea-level rise is 0.3–1.0 m by 2100. Under a high-emissions scenario, the very likely range is 0.5–1.9 m. The 95th percentile projection of 1.9 m can inform a high-end storyline, supporting decision-making for activities with low uncertainty tolerance. By quantifying a best estimate of scientific uncertainty, the fusion caters to diverse users. Earth's Climate History Explains Life's Temperature Optima, Schipper et al., Ecology and Evolution: Why does the growth of most life forms exhibit a narrow range of optimal temperatures below 40°C? We hypothesize that the recently identified stable range of oceanic temperatures of ~5 to 37°C for more than two billion years of Earth history tightly constrained the evolution of prokaryotic thermal performance curves to optimal temperatures for growth to less than 40°C. We tested whether competitive mechanisms reproduced the observed upper limits of life's temperature optima using simple Lotka–Volterra models of interspecific competition between organisms with different temperature optima. Model results supported our proposition whereby organisms with temperature optima up to 37°C were most competitive. Model results were highly robust to a wide range of reasonable variations in temperature response curves of modeled species. We further propose that inheritance of prokaryotic genes and subsequent co-evolution with microbial partners may have resulted in eukaryotes also fixing their temperature optima within this narrow temperature range. We hope this hypothesis will motivate considerable discussion and future work to advance our understanding of the remarkable consistency of the temperature dependence of life. Widespread outdoor exposure to uncompensable heat stress with warming, Fan & McColl, Communications Earth & Environment: Previous studies projected an increasing risk of uncompensable heat stress indoors in a warming climate. However, little is known about the timing and extent of this risk for those engaged in essential outdoor activities, such as water collection and farming. Here, we employ a physically-based human energy balance model, which considers radiative, wind, and key physiological effects, to project global risk of uncompensable heat stress outdoors using bias-corrected climate model outputs. Focusing on farmers (approximately 850 million people), our model shows that an ensemble median 2.8% (15%) would be subject to several days of uncompensable heat stress yearly at 2 (4) °C of warming relative to preindustrial. Focusing on people who must walk outside to access drinking water (approximately 700 million people), 3.4% (23%) would be impacted at 2 (4) °C of warming. Outdoor work would need to be completed at night or in the early morning during these events. ["uncompensable" means physiologically intolerable, acutely dangerous, ultimately deadly] Stabilising CO2 concentration as a channel for global disaster risk mitigation, Lu & Tambakis, Scientific Report: We investigate the influence of anthropogenic CO2 concentration fluctuations on the likelihood of climate-related disasters. We calibrate annual incidence rates against global disasters and CO2 growth spanning from 1960 to 2022 based on a dynamic panel logit model. We also study the sensitivity of disaster incidence to stochastic carbon dynamics consistent with IPCC-projected climate outcomes for 2100. The key insight is that present and lagged CO2 growth contains valuable information about the likelihood of future disaster events. We further show that lowering carbon stock uncertainty by dampening the persistence or the variability of CO2 concentration has a first-order impact on mitigating expected disaster risk. Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment, DeVerna et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) used for fact-checking affect the perception and dissemination of political news headlines. Despite the growing adoption of AI and tests of its ability to counter online misinformation, little is known about how people respond to LLM-driven fact-checking. This experiment reveals that even LLMs that accurately identify false headlines do not necessarily enhance users’ abilities to discern headline accuracy or promote accurate news sharing. LLM fact checks can actually reduce belief in true news wrongly labeled as false and increase belief in dubious headlines when the AI is unsure about an article’s veracity. These findings underscore the need for research on AI fact-checking’s unintended consequences, informing policies to enhance information integrity in the digital age. Droughts in Wind and Solar Power: Assessing Climate Model Simulations for a Net-Zero Energy Future, Liu et al., Geophysical Research Letters: Understanding and predicting “droughts” in wind and solar power availability can help the electric grid operator planning and operation toward deep renewable penetration. We assess climate models' ability to simulate these droughts at different horizontal resolutions, ∼100 and ∼25 km, over Western North America and Texas. We find that these power droughts are associated with the high/low pressure systems. The simulated wind and solar power variabilities and their corresponding droughts during historical periods are more sensitive to the model bias than to the model resolution. Future climate simulations reveal varied future change of these droughts across different regions. Although model resolution does not affect the simulation of historical droughts, it does impact the simulated future changes. This suggests that regional response to future warming can vary considerably in high- and low-resolution models. These insights have important implications for adapting power system planning and operations to the changing climate.

Relevant articles are then queried against the Unpaywall database, to identify open access articles and expose useful metadata for articles appearing in the database. The objective of New Research isn't to cast a tinge on scientific results, to color readers' impressions. Hence candidate articles are assessed via two metrics only: A few journals offer public access to "preprint" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as "preprint." The section "Informed opinion, nudges & major initiatives" includes some items that are not scientific research per se but fall instead into the category of "perspectives," observations of implications of research findings, areas needing attention, etc. Please let us know if you're aware of an article you think may be of interest for Skeptical Science research news, or if we've missed something that may be important.

Title: Amazon delays return to office for thousands of workers due to lack of space

Seattle – Amazon.com will not have enough space for thousands of employees when they start returning to the office five days a week in January. The company recently told some staff working in at least seven cities – including Austin, Dallas and Phoenix – that their return dates will be pushed back as much as four months, according to people familiar with the situation. The delay is the latest twist in a return-to-office (RTO) saga that has roiled Amazon’s normally heads-down workforce. Some employees say they are unhappy about being asked to come in full-time when many of their tech industry peers have more flexible work arrangements. Amazon employs more than 350,000 corporate employees worldwide – mostly in the US – and it is not clear precisely how many people are affected by the RTO delays. A company spokesperson said the vast majority of employees will have desks starting on Jan 2. Employees in Dallas were recently told there would not be sufficient space for them all to work five days a week in the office until March or April, one of the sources said. Some workers in the company’s Midtown Manhattan office in the Lord & Taylor building might not have space for full-time work until May, another source said. Amazon also notified employees in Atlanta, Nashville and Houston that it did not have sufficient space for them all to return in January, Business Insider reported on Dec 16. When chief executive Andy Jassy announced the aggressive return-to-work mandate in September, he and other executives said it was necessary to nurture an eroding company culture. But some employees suspect the mandate is an effort to thin the ranks and avoid layoffs and severance payments. Amazon denies this. Employees say they have proved in recent years that teams can be effective while working remotely. Some of those affected by the RTO delay reacted with relief – evidence that the five-day office mandate is widely unpopular. For more than a year, most Amazon employees have been asked to badge in three days a week, though there are exceptions for teams and fully remote positions. Amazon did not have enough seats ready for that initial RTO plan, including in Bellevue, Washington, where the company has focused much of its headquarters growth after building out its Seattle campus. Some workers say the company is still struggling to host employees three days a week. In recent interviews, employees complained of working from shared desks, crowded corporate canteens and a lack of conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. The company has added a feature to its room-reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work. It is not an ideal moment to be seeking new office space. While vacancies soared as remote work surged during the pandemic, there is now a shortage of the high-quality space typically leased by tech companies. Amazon has been leasing temporary space from WeWork in New York and Silicon Valley in recent weeks, a WeWork spokesperson confirmed. Coming out of the pandemic, Amazon froze hiring and tapped the brakes on its own real estate development, pausing high-profile office projects in Bellevue, Nashville, and at the company’s second headquarters campus in Arlington, Virginia. Some of those projects have since resumed and could eventually ease the strain. A spokesperson said that in most cases, the RTO delays are the result of reconfigurations of buildings that had been laid out to accommodate part-time remote workers, rather than a lack of available office space.

Title: The word business leaders use to hedge when staff ask if they're planning a return to 5 days in the office

Executives at major companies are referencing a specific term to hedge when asked by employees if they plan to follow in Amazon's footsteps and implement a return to 5 days a week in the office. That word? Productivity. While Amazon has been the most high-profile example this year of a full return to office policy, set to go into effect in January, telecom giant AT&T has also elected to double down on in-person work with a similar 5-day policy, Business Insider first reported. In the wake of Amazon's announcement, executives at both Google and Microsoft, which require employees to be in the office at least 3 days a week, have fielded questions from staff wondering if the days of hybrid work are numbered. Microsoft's executive vice president of cloud and AI, Scott Guthrie, said the company wouldn't change the hybrid work policy unless it noticed a drop in productivity, BI reported in September. In October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company had no plans to order employees back to the office, so long as employees remain productive during their at-home work days, BI previously reported. Over at Meta, Mark Zuckerberg said last year that "early analysis of performance data," indicated productivity increases for early-career engineers in the office at least 3 days a week. A few months later, the company announced it was requiring employees to return to the office 3 days a week. Executives at Dell called the company's sales team back to the office 5 days a week starting at the end of September, writing in a memo, "Our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite." Though Amazon did not explicitly name productivity as a reason for its full return to the office, CEO Andy Jassy emphasized a similar term: effectiveness. Being back in person 5 days a week makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," he wrote at the time. For those committing to a full return to office, preparing campuses for the influx of employees in the new year is its own challenge. Amazon has since delayed the announced January 2 effective date of the new mandate for some employees because it doesn't have enough office space in some locations, BI reported earlier this month. As CEOs and company leaders keep an eye on how employees in remote or hybrid setups perform, various studies since the onset of the pandemic have attempted to measure and compare the productivity of employees who work at home and in-office. Research studies have produced conflicting results, further complicated by the matter of how best to define or measure productivity. Goldman Sachs, which has a 5-day-in-office policy, reviewed several analyses that used different ways of evaluating changes in work-from-home productivity, from call-center workers who were randomly chosen to work from home to comparing the productivity of randomly assigned remote workers with their in-office peers. In short, it's hard to say for sure, and executives are deciding what their long-term setup will be after a year in which some of the world's biggest companies put a renewed focus on being "lean" and "efficient." Meanwhile, some employees have returned to commuting in (sometimes "coffee-badging" in and returning home), others have relocated to comply with a policy change, and some have resigned to pursue a hybrid or fully remote opportunity. As companies tighten their belts and conduct layoffs, other workers have taken to workplace forums to wonder if some of the RTO mandates have been a possible "quiet layoffs" tactic. As more major global companies revisit their policies and make changes, CEOs are likely to face more questions on the topic going into the new year. For some, the answer is simple: Stay productive and we'll stay flexible. Jump to
